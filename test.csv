28,"British Telecommunications' shares, which surged on Monday after weekend confirmation that the telecoms giant had merged with MCI of the U.S., should be valued at around four pounds each, analysts said on Monday.
News of the biggest trans-Atlantic deal in history, linking Britain's dominant telecoms company with America's second largest international carrier, has helped instititions on this side of the Atlantic reassess BT's growth prospects.
By 1306 GMT, almost 56 million shares had exchanged hands as the stock surged 28.5p to 379.5 pence down from an earlier 386p.  
""This deal will force people to look at BT in a new light; look at the international operations; look at the international alliances in Europe; to look at what they could be doing with the Internet because MCI is a big player there,"" said one analyst who asked to be named.
""All these much higher growth and much more exciting elements of BT in which the company has been quietly building value will come much more the fore,"" he added, noting that he was pitching the stock's true value at nearer 4.30 pounds.  
Analysts were split on how much of the share price rise was attributable to the $20 billion MCI merger, which included a 2.2 billion stg special dividend for BT shareholders.
But they said the market had been valuing the 22.6 billion stg group more as a UK utility, with 60 percent of its revenues governed by a regulatory price cap. However, having lined up six European joint-ventures, BT's share of the population in Europe for which they will have a licence could rise to 90 million.  
""In one year's time, only 15 percent of BT's revenues will be covered by a price cap. And, with their European operations getting off the ground, they will have a very substantial business in international markets,"" the analyst added.
Another analyst said that news of the special dividend alone had helped lift BT's shares by as much as 22 pence. Analysts have welcomed the move by BT, which has negligible gearing, to increase borrowing to make it more capital efficient.
""I think its a four-pound stock,"" he said. ""The market did want to see capital restructuring.""
The deal helps lift BT's gearing to around 65 percent.  
""The majority of the share price rise is a function of what is happening to the balance sheet rather than it being an indication that MCI was the right thing to buy,"" he added.
One analyst at brokers Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said that the MCI deal yielded a leverage benefit of about 0.4-0.5 percentage points off the weighted average cost of capital through BT being more highly geared.

28,"Cable &amp; Wireless (C&amp;W) on Friday brushed aside speculation that its landmark merger with three companies had run into hurdles and said it had got the man it wanted to run what will be Britain's biggest cable firm.
In a long-awaited statememt, C&amp;W said it would appoint Graham Wallace as chief executive of Cable and Wireless Communications, formed by merging C&amp;W's Mercury unit, Nynex Corp's NYNEX CableComms Group, Bell Cablemedia Plc, and Videotron Holdings Plc.
""Graham Wallace is the one we wanted,"" C&amp;W chief executive Richard Brown told Reuters in an interview.
""He is the first choice and we're delighted to get him.""
Wallace, who will join C&amp;W on February 1, is currently a director at leisure and media company Granada Group. But he brings with him useful experience in television from a stint on the board of satellite broadcaster BSkyB.
C&amp;W, is mainly a telecommunications business and has little previous experience in television.
But one analyst gave the appointment a lukewarm reception.
""It's not an obvious choice,"" said the analyst. ""He strikes me as very competent, but does he know anything about the cable business? I'm not quite sure why they didn't go for one of the insiders. There were some strong people, I thought.""
Although C&amp;W's shares were languishing 2.5 pence lower at 485.5 pence in late afternoon trade, NYNEX CableComms saw its shares rise 5.5 pence to 108.5 pence.
With C&amp;W, Britain's second biggest telecoms company, planning to finalise the cable merger in spring, the lack of a chief executive at the new company had fuelled some speculation that a clash of cultures was hindering talks.
Although Brown conceded that the merger was complicated, he insisted: ""That is not true...There's a great deal of activity and we really are right on track.
""There is an exciting spirit of cooperation to bring this to reality,"" he said.
Brown, who will take the chair of the company, tipped to be worth 5.0 billion pounds ($8.36 billion), said a finance director would be the next announcement.
The proposed cable merger was announced last October -- and most such deals spell job cuts.
Although Brown said he was not legally allowed to comment ahead of Cable and Wireless Communications's planned listing in London and New York, he warned that the new group would ""clearly"" reap efficiencies.
""I cannot quantify what that is going to be, but we are working on that and we will achieve that,"" he said.
Cable and Wireless Communications, which will be well-placed to compete against dominant telecoms company British Telecommunications, will provide local, national and international data and mobile telecommunications with multi-channel television and Internet services.

28,"British Telecommunications Plc and America's MCI Communications Corp looked set to sweep into South America amid differing reports on Monday that they had linked up with two key Iberian telephone operators.
A statement by BT that it had formed a strategic alliance with Portugal Telecom SA was confused by the English version of a similar announcement from the Portuguese company, which added that MCI had also formed a pan American joint venture with Spain's Telefonica de Espana.
BT, whose own statement made no reference to Telefonica, declined to comment. An MCI official in Lisbon further complicated the issue by saying the deal between MCI and Tisa, Telefonica's international arm, had been announced in ""error"".
A BT spokeswoman said only: ""We're pleased to be announcing Portgual Telecom today. We wouldn't comment on any other rumour or speculation but we are conscious that there is a lot of interest in the future of Telefonica.""
The announcements of new alliances come one day before BT's shareholders vote on its ambitious 12.3 billion pound ($20 billion) merger with MCI, America's second biggest long-distance carrier, called Concert Plc.
Investors, who are expected to back the deal despite concerns about the high price BT is paying, are likely to welcome any link up with Iberian phone groups which would create a formidable telephone network spanning Europe and the Americas.
Portugal Telecom will now become the exclusive distributor of Concert Communications Services, telecoms services with which Concert hopes to link high-margin, multinational business clients around the globe.
To reinforce the alliance, BT is taking a one percent and MCI a 0.5 percent stake in the $7.0 billion Portuguese company during its next stage of privatisation, expected later this year. A BT executive will be invited to take a seat on the company's board.
Despite BT's reticence in commenting on any imminent partnership with Telefonica, the company says it does want to explore opportunities in South America, where Portugal Telecom has formed an alliance with operator Telebras in the largest telecoms market, Brazil.
Brazil accounts for nearly 40 percent of South America's booming telecoms industry and its addition to the expanding Concert geographic jigsaw complements MCI's presence in 17 South American countries.
BT added: ""In addition, the companies will also seek other opportunities in the $36 billion Latin American communications market which is expected to grow to over $60 billion by the year 2000.""
Tisa dominates the fast-growing South American markets of Peru, Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Puerto Rico.
The flagship Spanish operator has been openly seeking a U.S. partner and an announcement is expected in the next few days.
Telefonica insisted that no deal with Concert had been signed on Monday and added that it was still in talks with both Concert and AT&amp;T. Meanwhile Portugal Telecom said that it was also in negotiations with other international partners which may take a stake in the company.
Some London analysts had expected Concert to take a  five percent stake in the Portuguese operator.
Analysts say any link-up with Concert will herald a sea-change in the European telecoms alliance landscape and come as a blow to BT's arch rival in Europe, America's AT&amp;T.
Speculation has been mounting that Telefonica is on the brink of announcing a long-rumoured exit from a rival partnership to Concert -- AT&amp;T's Unisource alliance with Dutch, Swedish and Swiss telecoms groups.
Any loss of the Spanish operator, which holds a 25 percent stake in Unisource, would be the latest setback for AT&amp;T which has been hoping to use the alliance as the vehicle for its European expansion.
Analysts at SBC Warburg say an alliance between Concert and Telefonica ""makes strategic sense for all involved"".
""Concert would become a formidable global carrier...(while Telefonica) would not only join the leading global seamless alliance but also increase the strategic value of its Latin American investments..."", the broker said in a recent report.
BT, which already has operations in more than 30 countries and employs 120,000 staff, has already formed joint ventures in the top six non-UK markets worth $135 billion, that include the key German and French markets.
Its Concert service portfolio, which it has developed with MCI, is available in 800 cities around the world.
The remaining vital gap in its global reach remains Asia, where BT has been attempting to link up with Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's biggest telecoms firm. ($ = 0.614 British Pounds)

28,"British Telecommunications admitted on Thursday to not sharing the same culture as its merger partner MCI Communications, America's second largest international carrier.
But after reporting robust third quarter profits, helped by ""healthy"" demand for its products and services, BT's chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield told reporters, ""We are open minded that these things (mergers) have their pitfalls on culture.""
Commentators have dubbed BT ""staid"" and MCI ""spunky"". But Bonfield said MCI staff he had met so far had been ""amazingly enthusiastic"" about the two companies' planned $20 billion merger, which BT expects European and American regulators to clear by this autumn.
After a 39 million pound ($64 million) charge for redundancies, BT's third quarter pretax profits rose to 909 million pounds ($1.45 billion) from 829 million pounds last time -- towards the upper end of analysts expectations.
BT announced last October that it planned to buy the 80 percent of MCI that it did not already own. The new group, called Concert Plc, aims to service multinational companies end-to-end and be represented in all the world's key nations.
BT also hopes to become the second telecoms operator in continental Europe as key markets are eased open to competition in 1998 and is itching to get into lucrative Asian markets.
BT has one of the most comprehensive network partnerships across Europe, having set up joint ventures in about eight continental European markets worth more than $140 billion.
In a move to boost its German venture, BT announced that Norwegian telecoms operator Telenor had agreed in principle to take a 10 percent stake in VIAG InterKom, the alliance BT has set up with German engineering conglomerate VIAG AG.
Telenor brings with it vital expertise from operating in one of the world's most saturated markets for mobile telephones. Having won a mobile and fixed-line licence in Germany, BT said VIAG InterKom would be the first major telecoms copany to exploit the convergence between the two services.
In December, BT beat arch-rivals Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom by clinching a deal with TeleDanmark in Switzerland's second telecom network Newtelco.
While global telecoms groups jockey for position in a race to secure lucrative services to multinational companies, Japan is seen as the last major frontier.
BT has been wooing Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's biggest telecoms titan, for years.
While NTT takes its time to decide how best to enter the international market, BT's finance director Robert Brace told Reuters that the group did not expect an MCI-type deal in the Asian telecoms markets ""in the next few years"".
""I think we will continue to develop on a global basis as and when the opportunities arrive,"" he said.
Bonfield, who was in Japan last week, said NTT was too big a company to risk linking up with a single company.
""But it may come up with a preferred partner -- and we would like to be that partner,"" he said. BT, which already has a technology agreement with NTT, is keen to use the $150 billion group's lines to sell its Concert services to business clients.
BT's share price, which has surged to new year highs of 450p in the run-up to results, seesawed despite what SocGen's analyst John Tysoe called ""a good, cheerful presentation"".
Tysoe has edged up his full year forecast to a pretax profit of 3.2 billion pounds, largely because of a 50 million pound reduction in the level of expected redundancy charges.
BT saw net cash inflow swell to 4.4 billion pounds in the first nine months and has now got a hefty 211 million pounds of funds on its balance sheet.

28,"British commercial TV giant Granada Group on Wednesday tabled a formal 711 million pound ($1.2 billion) agreed bid for its neighbour Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television although some shareholders remained opposed the price.
(corrects dollar conversion).
Yorkshire Tyne-Tees Chairman Ward Thomas called on institutional investor Mercury Asset Management to rethink its opposition to the 11.75 pound per share bid, which he said was a good price.
""I hope on reflection they will come into line,"" he told Reuters in an interview, adding that any speculation that a counter bidder may offer a higher price might well be ""just poppycock"".
MAM, who Thomas said had been the most vocal opponent of the takeover price, declined to comment amid speculation that it had bought some of its five percent Yorkshire stake at 13 pounds a share.
Thomas said he had received no indication from United News &amp; Media Plc about how the company would vote its 14 percent Yorkshire stake amid talk that managing director Clive Hollick may launch a counter bid.
""I've no idea whether Clive Hollick will or not,"" said Ward. ""But I would have thought his target is much more likely to be HTV Group Plc.
""But if he does, well the shareholders will be happy and MAM will be right and I will be wrong.""
Granada, which already owns 27 percent of Yorkshire, is offering two new Granada shares and 1,825.32 pence in cash for every three Yorkshire shares -- an offer Thomas said he had agreed to by telephone while on a holiday in the South of France just over two weeks ago.
The companies said that Yorkshire would pay an interim dividend of 7.5 pence.
Thomas said in the offer statement that although Yorkshire had fully recovered from problems that beset it in 1993 -- when it plunged into the red and its share price collapsed to around 1.20 pounds -- it was operating in an increasingly competitive market.
""As a result, your board now believes that a combination with the Granada broadcasting business is in the best interest of shareholders and will safeguard the future of Yorkshire and Tyne Tees Television and their ability to provide for the areas they serve,"" he said.
Shares in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees traded were slightly firmer after a sobering trading statement limited gains, rising 2.5p to 1,157.5p having earlier scaled to a high of 11.70 pounds.
""What's hurting the (Yorkshire) shares is its trading statement...It's a pretty damning indictment of what's happening,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Yorkshire said it expected a disappointing second quarter, citing lower-than-expected growth in ITV advertising revenue and a failure to increase market share.
The statement also said the company believed total advertising revenue growing for commercial television ITV would show only minimal growth during the first half of 1997. It blamed the slowdown on the launch of a new channel and industry-wide weakness.
Granada chairman Gerry Robinson remained unperturbed, and said the two companies' existing airtime and international programme sales arrangements provided a solid foundation for a merger.
""We believe that the strategic arguments in favour of the combination are both powerful and widely accepted,"" he said.
Granada, whose interests span broadcasting, leisure, hotels and catering, owns the independent television (ITV) franchise for north-west England, which is adjacent to Yorkshire's area.
The deal will need regulatory approval, and Robinson said earlier this month he believed it would take some two months to complete even if everything went smoothly. ($ = 0.599 British Pounds)

28,"Scotland-based hotels and casinos group Stakis on Thursday said it will buy Lonrho Plc's five Metropole hotels, funding the 327 million pound ($530 million) deal with a huge cash call on shareholders.
Stakis, which operates 46 British hotels and 22 casinos -- and whose current market value is only about 472 million pounds -- said it wanted to raise 222 million pounds via a heavyweight four-for-seven rights issue, set at 82 pence per share.
""We've found a reasonable and sensible price for a very good, perhaps unique, product,"" Stakis chief executive David Michels told a news conference.
Lonrho, which is in the throes of a demerger, said in a separate statement that the disposal would generate net proceeds of 316 million pounds as well as payments of 63 million pounds in dividends and tax relief that it will receive from the chain.
""The proposed sale of Metropole Hotels represents an important step in the separation of Lonrho's mining and non-mining assets...,"" said Lonrho chairman John Leahy, adding that the firm was continuing to make progress with its demerger.
Last month, Lonrho shelved plans for a 700 million pound flotation of its Metropole and its North American-based Princess luxury resort hotels because of the level of interest it had received from potential buyers.
Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal has been tipped as the most likely buyer of the 10 five-star Princess hotels. Lonrho expects to announce the sale in about three weeks.
The sale of the hotels, which will be followed by the divestment of the group's African trading operations, is part of Lonrho's plans to turn itself into a focused mining company and ends 30 years of empire building by founder Tiny Rowland.
Stakis had been the front-runner to buy the conglomerate's Metropole chain -- four-star hotels with extensive conference facilities -- since rival Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels pulled out of the bidding race earlier this month.
The hotels group said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings from the first year and forecast 1996 group profit before tax and exceptionals would be over 30.6 million pounds.
Stakis also forecast a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share, giving a total payout of 2.15 pence for the full year -- 23 percent more than last year.
The company, which had been in acquisition talks with Lonrho for about 15 months, plans to cut costs at the hotels and boost profits by boosting occupancy -- currently at about 68 percent.
Analysts welcomed the deal. ""The numbers stack up. I have no problem with their strategy,"" said Matthew Nayler, leisure analyst at brokers Williams de Broe.
Analysts estimate that Stakis will have to boost profits at the hotels -- in the cities of London and Birmingham and the seaside resorts of Brighton and Blackpool -- by at least 12 percent for the purchase to be profitable.
In an innovative move by investment bank Schroders that will save Stakis some money on commissions, the bank is arranging a partial tender for sub-underwriting of the rights issue by investment institutions in which sub-underwriters will be allowed to tender at lower commissions for additional sub- underwriting above their initial allocations.
Schroders will then cut the primary underwriting commission charged to Stakis at the same rate as any reduction in total sub-underwriting charges.
""We may lose money but we think change (to commission rates) is inevitable,"" Schroders' Robert Swannell told reporters.
The market is now awaiting news on Lonrho's sale of the Princess hotels, which include resorts in Acapulco, Mexico, the Caribbean and the U.S.
A Lonrho spokesman said news on this was expected in approximately three weeks.
Financial sources in the Gulf said earlier this month that the Saudi prince had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal and that the price was $300 million. The prince's key western investments include stakes in New York's luxury Plaza hotel, the Four Seasons hotel group, banking group Citicorp and the Disneyland Paris theme park.

28,"Analysts said on Monday they were expecting UK electronic business information company M.A.I.D Plc to launch new screen-based products that would rival services offered by real-time financial news services.
M.A.I.D declined to comment on a newspaper report that it was working on new online products that would undercut the prices of international news and information group Reuters Holdings Plc and financial news group Bloomberg LP.
The company's executives are on a roadshow in the U.S. for about a week. But a company spokesman said: ""We never comment on market speculation regarding product development.""
The Sunday Times said M.A.I.D was poised to unveil a screen-based real time news service at sharply lower prices than services from Reuters or Bloomberg. Other products could include transmitting financial data to hand-held devices using mobile-telephone technology, the newspaper added.
Analysts had heard a deal was on the cards between MAID and Finnish group Nokia to start a mobile share price service and expected a similar deal with Psion Plc.
Experts said they had also been waiting for Reuters and MAID to launch more similar, rival services.
""I'm totally unsurprised at the article,"" said Keith Woolcock, analyst at Merrill Lynch. ""MAID and Reuters are going to be competing more in the future. Their products are going to become more similar, I think,""
Reuters Business Briefing, the Reuters service against which MAID is expected to compete, offers mainly online business news and share price data at the moment, whereas about 70 percent of MAID's data is market research information.
But analysts expect soon to be able to set up a customised service on MAID systems so that they are alerted to pre-selected requested headlines as stories appear on MAID's news services.
""I know they have been working on that,"" noted one analyst who declined to be named. ""The big deal is having the alerts built in. The key thing about this is what they are going to charge for it in America...
""If they offer this new alert service for free then it's very hot and will make it very hard for anyone to compete."" Analysts expect MAID to tie up a deal with the Financial Times, adding it to French news agency Agence France Presse and U.S. services as well as direct links to other newspapers.
Reuters Business Briefing, meanwhile, is branching out into market research.
Market research group Datamonitor said it has signed a deal with Reuters since ending a similar contract with MAID.
From November no Datamonitor research will be available on MAID anymore, a Datamonitor spokesman said.

28,"Music companies are waiting for the world to rock to a new sound that will entice consumers back into record stores and drive up sluggish global sales.
Without new global best sellers and an economic upturn, few analysts expect the global market to bask in the double-digit growth seen from 1984 to 1994 when people lined about around the block to get the latest records such as pop group R.E.M.'s ""Monster.""
Discounting among retailers, international piracy of cassettes and compact discs and an ageing population, whose first stop at the mall might be a book store rather than a record store, have all hit the more mature markets.
Global sales of pre-recorded music reached $39.8 billion in 1996, a 5.5 percent growth in retail value over 1995. Four billion compact discs, cassettes and records -- 4 percent more than in 1995 -- were sold.
But the rate of growth is slowing. In retail value, global growth was 6 percent in 1995 and a hefty 15 percent in 1994.
The figures, compiled by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represents the world's record firms, confirm that growth in developing markets is surging. But more mature markets such as North America have been hit by static sales and falling prices.
David Chermont, media analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that investors had become used to the lack of ""mind-blowing"" growth, however, in an industry which is made up of a mix of growth and cyclical markets that wax and wane with economic confidence.
""Double-digit growth is not sustainable even in the healthiest markets,"" he said. ""I feel quite comfortable.""
Another analyst, who declined to be identified, noted, ""The whole industry can explode if a new sound suddenly arrives on the scene that starts driving sales.""
Meanwhile, the main engine of growth has shifted away from the mature, developed markets, the figures show.
The IFPI said, ""In 1996 around 70 percent of the world's music growth was generated in less developed markets -- in particularly from Latin America and Asia.""
""This compares to only 20 percent in 1993, when global growth was at a similar level to 1996.""
But the trade body brushed aside concerns that the industry was under serious threat by technology such as CD-ROMs, booming international piracy and because the babies borne during the rocking 1960s were now approaching middle age and no longer bought music.
""There is a huge potential in music,"" Nic Garnett, director general of IFPI, told a seminar during London Music Week, noting that the global market had surged from $27 billion to almost $40 billion in the last five years. ""This is very much a thriving, global business,"" he said.
""No market is that mature where the exciting process of new artists coming through cannot re-ignite (it),"" he added. But he called on governments to protect the intellectual property business with copyright laws that prevent ""pirates"" from copying and re-selling cassettes or compact discs at vastly cheaper prices.
Piracy is one of the most serious crimes threatening the $35 billion U.S. recording industry and represents losses of over $2 billion every year, the IFPI said.
Five big music companies control about two thirds of the market -- PolyGram NV of the Netherlands; Japan's Sony Corp.; Warner, part of Time Warner Inc.; Germany's Bertelsmann AG; and EMI Group Plc of Britain.

28,"Cable and Wireless Communications, Britain's new cable giant, said on Monday it might seek further acquisitions as it set the formal stage for its complex formation and partial flotation.
Releasing 36 pages of detailed documents slightly ahead of schedule, new chief executive Graham Wallace said the merger of four cable telephone and television companies announced in October offered a unique range of products and services.
Nevertheless, the new company, which plans to list 14.7 percent of its shares in London and New York in the next few weeks, might go back on the acquisition trail.
""Here we've formed the (UK's) largest cable company, so we've taken the first step in the consolidation of the industry -- and we'll look at other acquisitions as and when they will arrive,"" Wallace said during a telephone conference call with journalists.
But he added: ""We have a scale and mass here that gives us a significant advantage. We certainly don't need to be any larger.""
Valued at between 4.0 and 7.0 billion pounds ($11.2 billion) by analysts, the merger brings together Cable and Wireless's Mercury subsidiary and the British cable television units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada's Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron.
The new company, which will serve about 1.2 million telephony and 580,000 cable TV customers, will provide a broad range of local, national and international voice and data services, and in certain regions, multichannel television and internet computer services.
It hopes to complete its broadband cable and local telephony networks by investing some 110 million pounds over two years and offer services to more than six million residential customers. It also wants to serve almost all small and medium-sized businesses within its 45 cable franchise areas.
The group will spend another 180 million pounds over the same period on so-called set top box, with which customers can receive multi channel television services.
It hopes to launch a formidable attack on the dominance of British Telecommunications Plc in telephony. Regulatory restrictions prevent BT from offering broadcasting services.
The formal offers from Cable and Wireless Communications to shareholders of the merger partners were launched on Monday as well as financial details of the company. Bell Cablemedia promptly recommended that its shareholders accept the offer.
Cable and Wireless Communications' pro forma revenues for the year to March 31, 1996, were 1.90 billion pounds with net income of 44 million pounds.
Since the merger was announced, talk has mounted that a global telecoms alliance such as the Global One partnership of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp might take a stake in the venture.
With 14.7 percent of Cable and Wireless Communications (C&amp;WC) due to be floated in London and New York, the next few weeks will provide new shareholders with the opportunity to join the group -- or give old partners a chance to leave.
Newspapers have tipped Bell Canada as being a likely candidate to sell what will be a 14.2 percent stake and end its exposure to the Britain's stagnant cable market.
But Wallace declined to comment on alliance speculation or Bell Canada's (BCM) long-term strategic plans, saying only: ""(BCM) is very happy with the investment that it has in C&amp;WC as far as we are aware.""
France Telecom confirmed last week that it was in talks with Cable and Wireless about the cable venture becoming the British partner of the Global One alliance.
Wallace said Cable and Wireless, which will have a 52.6 percent stake in the new company, wanted to remain a majority shareholder and would consider further investment of its own if its current partners backed out.
Britain will be C&amp;WC's short-term focus, But Wallace said the group is also eyeing continental Europe.
Analysts are keenly awaiting the partial float so that the market can value the business which has assets worth 4.5 billion pounds.
The first closing date for the offers is April 25. The listings will immediately follow completion.
Under the terms of the offer, each Bell Cablemedia (BCM) ordinary share receives 0.69389 C&amp;WC ordinary shares.
The offer for NYNEX CableComms shareholders includes a deal of 0.330714 C&amp;WC ordinary shares for each NYNEX CableComms UK ordinary share.
Around 65 percent of BCM and 67 percent of NYNEX shareholders have said they would accept the offer. ($ = 0.623 British Pounds)

Industry officials and analysts said most winter clothing was cleared out of stores in January and early February, so retailers were properly stocked for spring.
Salomon Bros. said its index of same-store sales rose 4.7 percent in February, compared to a 5.2 percent rise a year ago and a 7.3 percent January rise. Same-store sales measure results at stores open at least a year.
""It looks like early trends on spring fashion are good,"" said Harry Ikenson, analyst at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc. ""Inventories seem to be in good shape and it's a good start to spring.""
""After January's sales performance, our level of clearance merchandise coming into February was substantially below last year,"" said William Kellogg, chairman of Kohl's Corp., a Wisconsin-based retailer with 150 stores in the Midwest and the East.
""We are particularly encouraged by the early selling of spring merchandise.""
Though comparisons were difficult after retailers posted a strong February in 1996, a week of temperatures in the 50s and 60s in much of the country this year was a plus.
""It drives people in to buy spring merchandise,"" analyst Peter Schaeffer at Dillon Read &amp; Co. said.
Several chains posted stronger-than-expected results.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's larget retailer, said same-store sales rose 6.7 percent, above analysts' forecasts, while J.C. Penney Co. Inc. posted a strong 11.4 percent gain.
Kmart Corp., the third-biggest retailer, said sales rose 3.9 percent at comparable stores, while Sears, Roebuck and Co., the No. 2 retailer, posted a 1.6 percent gain.
Among department stores, Dayton Hudson Corp. said sales rose 4.2 percent, Federated Department Stores Inc. reported a 2.2 percent gain and Dillard Department Stores Inc. had a 1 percent rise.
Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. reported on Monday that February sales rose a solid 8.2 percent.
""I was particularly pleased with the strong initial sell-through on new spring receipts during the month,"" Carson Chief Executive Stanton Bluestone said in a statement.
Sales at clothing chain The Gap Inc. were flat.
Sales of computers and other electronic gear continued to lag, though results were not as weak as had been expected.
Electronics superstores Best Buy Co. Inc. and Circuit City Stores said sales fell 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Analysts had expected sales declines of up to 10 percent.
Sales of electronic gear, which have been dismal for several months, were unlikely to improve until later this year or early 1998 when new high-tech products are due to be available, analysts said.
They also said retail stocks were unlikely to be as strong as they were in 1996.
""I don't think that we're seeing any sort of a rally here in retail like we saw last year,"" Dillon Read's Schaeffer said. ""I don't think it's a sector play, it's an individual stock play.""
Gap shares fell $1.25 to $32.50, Dillard fell 25 cents to $30.25, Sears lost 75 cents to $54.875, and Federated was unchanged at $35.875.
Best Buy rose $1.375 to $10, Circuit City added $2 to $33.75, Wal-Mart rose 12.5 cents to $26.75 and J.C. Penney gained 37.5 cents to $49.50.

32,"Mercury Finance Co. said Thursday it was suspending payment of a previously announced dividend while it tries to secure short-term financing as it falls deeper and deeper into debt.
The troubled consumer finance company said it had been unable to refinance a total of $61 million in commerical paper -- or short-term debt -- that had matured through Wednesday. Another $127 million comes due between Thursday and Feb. 14, Lake Forest, Ill.-based Mercury said in a news release.
The company has been in violation of certain loan covenants since last week, when it was unable to pay $17 million in commercial debt.
Mercury has been in turmoil since it announced last week that accounting irregularities had caused it to overstate its earnings by about $90 million.
It said accounting misstatements appeared to stem from unauthorised entries by former controller James Doyle. But Doyle's lawyer has accused the comapny of a ""charade"" and said Doyle is cooperating with federal authorities.
FBI agents served a search warrant seeking financial records Monday.
Mercury said Thursday that it suspended a dividend payment of 7.5 cents a share that was payable March 3.
The company also said it was continuing to try to obtain short-term financing from its lenders in talks that have been taking place all week.
It added that funds from the short-term financing will be used exclusively for operating purposes and will not be available for paying principal or interest on company debt.
One analyst said the apparent lack of a report so far by new auditors on the extent of the accounting discrepancies might be hindering the talks with lenders.
""Certainly, (the talks are) complicated in one instance by the default on the commercial paper to date and what seems to be the lack of resolution on the extent and nature of the accounting regularities,"" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co.
Earlier this week William Brandt Jr., a turnaround and bankruptcy specialist who replaced John Brincat as chief executive officer Monday, told Reuters the company needed about four weeks of financing to gain time to stabilise the firm.
Mercury, which makes used-car loans to individuals of often relatively low creditworthiness, also said Thursday that operations were continuing at all of the company's 280 locations nationwide.
Market sources said there had been rumours of bids for Mercury's commercial paper at 50 percent to 80 percent of face value.
One attorney familiar with bankruptcy matters said bidders might be trying to have more influence if Mercury is forced to file for bankruptcy.
""It is not uncommon for investment groups to be buying paper at a discount to improve their situation in a restructuring,"" said Ted Koenig, attorney at Holleb &amp; Coff in Chicago.
Meanwhile, another auto lender, Evanston, Ill.-based First Enterprise Financial Group Inc. said it did not report 1996 earnings as expected Thursday and that it was reviewing its portfolio in light of recent developments in the industry.
An analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. lowered that stock to hold from buy.
""We believe the Mercury situation is causing audit firms to take a much harder position with automobile finance companies,"" Chicago Corp. said in a research report.
First Enterprise stock plunged $4 to $8.25 on Nasdaq.
The fallout from Mercury's financial troubles is also striking a foundation established by Mercury founder Daniel Terra, who died in June.
The foundation, which funds the Terra Museum of American Art in Chicago and an American musuem in Giverny, France, holds 8 million shares as part of its $350 million endowment.
Those shares were worth more than $116 million a week ago, but were worth about $21 million Thursday.
Mercury stock was unchanged at $2.625 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.

32,"Hyatt Hotels Corp. said Monday it will spend $1 billion over the next three years to acquire 20 to 30 hotels, rapidly accelerating its expansion programme.
Target properties will be upscale three- to five-star hotels and resorts in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean over a three-year period, said Hyatt, which is owned by Chicago's Pritzker family.
The company already has made two deals which it says are typical of the expansion plan. Last Friday, a Hyatt affiliate purchased the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, which Hyatt has managed since 1973, for $125 million plus the assumption of $5 million in debt, the company said.
On Friday, Chicago-based Hyatt will take over management of the Hotel Nikko Atlanta after acquiring the hotel in partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Partners for $90 million. The hotel will be renamed the Grand Hyatt Atlanta.
Hyatt, which operates 176 Hyatt hotels and resorts around the world, purchased 12 hotels in the past three years.
The more aggressive acquisition stance was seen by some as a response to acqusition plans by Hyatt's competitors.
""Hyatt is probably doing this to be defensive,"" said Burland East, analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago, noting that the move comes as other hoteliers, including Host Marriott Corp. and Hilton Hotels Corp., are looking to expand.
Hyatt's plan was made easier by a recent reorganization of some Pritzker family holdings. The family recently formed Hyatt Equities L.L.C., a real estate acquisition company that consolidates a number of the family's hotel real estate interests into one company, Hyatt said.
Hyatt Equities was created to capitalise on the equity value of the Pritzkers' hotel portfolio, allowing the company to borrow against a collection of assets instead of individual assets at more favourable interest rates.
""Hyatt Equities provides an additional vehicle through which we will grow our family's interest in Hyatt hotel real estate, enabling Hyatt to acquire hotels already managed by Hyatt as well as hotels currently managed by other hotel companies,"" Nicholas Pritzker, president of Hyatt Development and Hyatt Equities, said in a news release.
Hyatt Equities debt will be rated by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, and Hyatt's investment bankers anticipate strong investment-grade ratings Hyatt said.
Hyatt said that, as a private company, Hyatt Equities is able to use a broader set of transaction structures than is typically available to public companies, real estate investment trusts or acquisition funds.
Among real estate investment trusts that could wind up competing with Hyatt for upscale properties are Dallas-based Patriot American Hospitality Inc. and Phoenix-based Starwood Lodging Trust, East said.
""At the margins, 30 hotels is meaningful,"" East said of the impact of Hyatt's plan on the hotel landscape. ""Is it earth-shattering? No.""

32,"Banyan Strategic Realty Trust, which releases its full 1996 results early next week, will report funds from operations (FFO) of $0.03 a share for the 1996 fourth quarter, down from $0.07 a share a year ago.
Leonard Levine, chief executive of the real estate investment trust also said Friday that funds from operations for the year ended December 31 would be $0.34 a share, up from $0.32 a share a year ago.
But the company expects funds from operations, the standard measure of a REITs performance, to jump in 1997.  
""In 1997, we expect our targeted numbers for FFO, both as a result of acquisitions made in late '96 and continuing acquisitions in early '97...will be somewhere between $0.50 and $0.55,"" Levine said in an interview.
The company's target for 1998 FFO is $0.65 to $0.70 a share, not including additional acquisitions, which it expects to make.
By June 30 of this year, Banyan expects to own 19 properties in the Midwest and Southeast, including industrial buildings, suburban office buildings, apartment complexes and a retail center.  
""Real estate is cyclical and the best way to protect against that cycle is to spread your risk,"" Levine said in explaining Banyan's strategy, which is counter to most REITs, which focus on one property sector.
The company focuses on markets without much competition from larger REITs.  
""Our principal investment strategy is to focus on smaller real estate markets and smaller properties where we believe there continues to be extraordinary opportunities available to us to purchase stable and appreciating real estate and where the economies are both very strong and there continues to be an absence of credit and capital,"" Levine said.
Banyan buys properties with an eye toward both improving its revenue stream and selling at a profit down the road.
The company hopes to speed its portfolio growth in coming years and Levine expects Banyan to make some sort of equity offering in the next year to raise market capital.
""I think sometime within the next 12 months we'll be exploring ways in which the company can grow from that perspective,"" Levine said of a potential equity offering.
Among the benefits from an equity offering would be to improve Banyan's liquidity, he added.
Shares of the company closed Wednesday at four and have not traded since.

32,"Struggling to stay on course away from its troubled past, Trans World Airlines Inc. now must find a new chief executive to take the helm of the troubled carrier.
How quickly it can find an experienced airline executive for the job will determine whether it stays on course or runs into more financial trouble, industry analysts said.
The St. Louis-based airline said on Thursday that Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Erickson, who has headed the company for the past two years, will leave in January.
""The last thing that the company needs now is more management turmoil,"" said one analyst, who declined to be identified. ""It doesn't have a strong or stable enough footing to deal with this kind of stuff.""
Erickson's departure comes just four months after Chief Financial Officer Robert Peiser left the company. At the time, TWA said Peiser's decision to leave was over differences in management direction.
""They're going to have to regain the confidence of Wall Street,"" said William Fiala, who follows the airline industry for Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., which is based in TWA's hometown. ""The only way they're going to do that is by coming up with a leader that's a proven turnaround (manager), or well-respected in the industry.""
Erickson, who became chief executive officer in August 1994, brought the airline through a bankruptcy reorganization and back to where it was buying new aircraft. But the turnaround is not finished, and higher fuel costs and the July 17 crash of flight 800, which hurt confidence in the carrier and therefore its sales, have stalled the company's improvement.
""Erickson was the one who really steered them through the first half of the turnaround, but they still have a way to go,"" Fiala said.
The company on Thursday reported a $14.3 million third-quarter loss and said its yield, a measure of fares, fell in the quarter.
Industry experts said TWA's board of directors might have become impatient with the pace of the turnaround after seeing the third-quarter results. But they also quickly defended Erickson's record at the company.
""When you see what TWA was three years ago and what it is now, it's a world of difference,"" said Michael Boyd, president of Aviation Systems Research Corp., a research and consulting firm  in Golden, Colo.
""I do not see anything you can ascribe to Jeffrey Erickson that occurred in the third quarter. I don't see any decision made by Jeffrey Erickson that messed up the airline.""
Calls to Erickson at TWA's offices Friday were transferred to a public relations office, which said he was unavailable for comment. TWA Chairman Thomas Meagher did not return telephone calls.
Analysts said TWA's board would need to move quickly and that the next chief executive would need a good degree of independence from the board.
""Whatever they do to replace Erickson, they need a hands-on manager, not a messiah,"" the consultant Boyd said. ""In a situation like this, you have to have free reign. You can't have people behind you second-guessing every one of your moves.""
Boyd said several managers at United Airlines might be interested in the job. He also suggested that former Alaska Air Group Chief Executive Raymond Vecci could be a candidate.
Earlier this year, Erickson, who was criticised by families of the flight 800 victims for the company's response to the crash, told students at Washington University in St. Louis that the aftermath of the crash was draining, said Stuart Greenbaum, dean of the university's business school.
""I can't help believing the crash just took a lot out of Jeff,"" said Greenbaum, who said he is a friend of Erickson's. ""That was so difficult for him, as it would be for any human being, to try to represent the company to the world"" after the tragedy, in which 230 died.

32,"First Bank System Inc is seen paying a premium price to expand its geographic footprint to the Pacific Northwest with its planned $9 billion acquisition of Portland, Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp.
""This is very rich pricing,"" analyst James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp said, noting that the deal -- which would make First Bank the 14th largest bank in the United States based on assets -- values U.S. Bancorp at about $59.08 a share, or 19.2 times 1996 earnings.  
U.S. Bancorp shares were up 6-3/16 at 54-7/16 Thursday.
But at the same time, First Bank chief executive John Grundhofer's reputation for aggressive cost cutting, the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with Minneapolis-based First Bank's mostly Midwestern markets, and the rich price of bank stocks in general, make the deal palatable to analysts.
""It's a natural fit for them,"" said Frank Barkocy, analyst at Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross. ""It's a natural extension of their marketplace.""  
First Bank said it would be able to grow revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp's extensive corporate base. Home equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp's customers, while U.S. Bancorp's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers, the banks said.
""Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines,"" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group.  
First Bank expects to cut the combined banks' operating expenses by about 14 percent, with a pre-tax cost savings of about $340 million.
""We believe that (First Bank's) ability to cut costs could make this deal work,"" Salomon Brothers said in a note on the deal, according to market sources.
While First Bank stock was down 3-1/2 at 74-3/4 Thursday, analysts still saw the deal as a positive for the acquisition minded bank.
""They've got the acqusition history behind them,"" Biggar said. ""They've got a management that can make deals work.""  
The deal could also spark more bank consolidation, especially in the Midwest, with buyers swooping in while First Bank is busy consolidating its purchase, analysts said.
""We expect this announcement could trigger other activity,"" Salomon Brothers said, according to market sources.
Among potential targets frequently mentioned are Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp and Cleveland-based KeyCorp. Schutz even argues that Chicago-based First Chicago NBD Corp could be an attractive target at a reasonable price.
""For bang for the buck, First Chicago is probably the most lucrative"" in terms of Midwest markets, he said.

32,"Modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp's stock soared Wednesday on talk that it may be close to unveiling a faster analog modem.
Skokie, Illinois- based U.S. Robotics told an Oppenheimer &amp; Co investors conference Tuesday that it is looking at developing new technologies including higher speed modems.
The company has previously said that it did not believe 33.6 kilobits per second was the fastest speed for modems.
While the company did not say whether it had developed a faster modem, an Oppenheimer analyst said the presentation on the subject was more elaborate than discussions on the topic in the past.
""This is the first time they've ever discussed this with some slides and everything,"" Oppenheimer analyst Steven Levy said.  ""To the extent there is one, it's probably not too far away.""
Meanwhile, Rockwell International Corp's semiconductor systems unit said late Tuesday it expects to demonstrate 56 kilobit transmission capabilities at a trade show in November.
That added to sentiment that such a modem, which would speed Internet communication over standard telephone lines, was more than just theory, analysts said.
Analysts said U.S. Robotics has about an 80 percent share of the modem market for online services and a 38 percent share for desktop modems that connect users with those services.
If U.S. Robotics can quickly market a faster modem, it could help the company hold or improve that share, as there is no standardization at the 56 kilobit level, analysts said. In other words, Rockwell and U.S. Robotics' modems don't ""talk"" to each other.
""Clearly we have an issue of standardization process that will take time and during that time, there's an opportunity for the company to be the only supplier,"" said Rakesh Sood, analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
U.S. Robotics would not comment about whether it was close to releasing a faster modem. The stock was up 4-3/8 to 56-7/8 on Nasdaq Wednesday. Rockwell International stock rose 1/4 to 54-1/8 in NYSE trading.
Sood noted that modems are a far bigger part of U.S. Robotics' business than Rockwell International's.

32,"A conservative forecast for 1997, calling for profits near 1996 levels, helped push Caterpillar Inc stock lower despite record earnings reported for 1996 Tuesday.
But the outlook was also causing some analysts to question the conservatism of the Peoria-based heavy equipment maker.
""Caterpillar always looks at the glass being half empty,"" said Thomas Burns Jr., an analyst at NatWest Securities Corp. ""We think it's half full.""  
""We expect a better U.S. economy,"" Burns said. ""We don't expect housing starts to be off."" He noted that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan made positive comments about the economy Tuesday.
But Caterpillar said in its earnings statement that it expects U.S. gross domestic product growth of about two percent in 1997, slower than in 1996.
Burns is also more optimistic about European growth than Caterpillar.
""Clearly, as far as we're concerned, there's a turn up on the way in Europe,"" he said.  
But in Caterpillar's view, bullish factors will be offset by delays of infrastructure products as countries impose fiscal restraint to meet the entry criteria for the European Monetary Union.
Caterpillar reported earnings of $381 million, or $1.99 a share for the fourth quarter of 1996, above the $1.53 a share reported in 1995 and the consensus estimate of $1.88 a share reported by First Call Corp.  
But the stock was down 1-1/8 at 77-3/8 Tuesday, mostly because of the outlook.
""It's basically '97,"" Lisa Shalett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said of the stock's downturn. But she noted that one-time currency factors helped boost the earnings above estimates.
""It comes across as a surprise, but it's not necessarily a surprise from operations,"" Shalett said.
Still, despite Caterpillar's guidance on profits in 1997, Burns and other analysts are sticking by estimates showing earnings per share climbing from the $7.07 reported in 1996.
Burns estimates earnings of $7.70 a share for 1997.
Blair Brumley, an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc, is even more bullish, forecasting earnings of $8.00 a share.
""It doesn't look like there's anything in the outlook statement that would cause us to be concerned with this year,"" Brumley said, noting that share repurchases, gains in the engine business from a recent acquisition and price gains from new products should boost earnings.
""Even assuming flat unit sales, you're not going to see a flat bottom line,"" he said.

32,"Equity Residential Properties Trust, a real estate investment trust led by Chicago real estate investor Sam Zell, agreed Friday to buy Wellsford Residential Property Trust( in a deal valuing Wellsford at $1 billion.
The deal would make Equity Residential, which is already the largest publicly traded apartment building owner in the country, the second largest real estate investment trust in any category, the company said.
""Consolidation of this industry is critical for its evolution,"" Zell, who is chairman of Equity Residential, said in a statement. ""The size and liquidity of the combined entity reinforces EQR's status as the No. 1 multifamily (real estate investment trust).""
The deal values New York-based Wellsford at about $1 billion, or $29.61 a share, an 18.7 percent premium over its recent stock price, the companies said.
Equity Residential said it expected to trim about $3.1 million in annual general and administrative expenses and $800,000 in property management expenses after the closing of the deal, which is expected to occur by May.
Equity Residential expects the merger to add 10 cents to 13 cents a share in annualized funds from operation -- the measure commonly used to measure real estate investment fund performance.
When the deal closes, Equity Residential will own and operate 317 properties with 90,873 units. It also adds properties in areas like the Pacific Northwest and West Coast, where strong demand allows for higher rents.
""Those markets have higher rental growth than the national average from other markets,"" said Jeff Langbaum, associate analyst at investment firm Alex. Brown &amp; Sons. Equity Residential estimated rent growth in those areas at 5 percent to 6 percent annualy, while Langbaum estimated the national average at about 4 percent.
Each Wellsford share will be exchanged for 0.625 share of Equity Residential, or about $27.11, plus one share of Wellsford Properties Inc., a newly formed company that will continue Wellsford's development activities, the companies said in a joint statement.
The exchange ratio is subject to upward revision if Equity Residential shares fall below $40. If they drop below $37, the parties have the right to terminate the merger agreement.
Equity Residential also will exchange about $158 million in preferred shares. In addition, Equity Residential will assume about $330 million in Wellsford's debt.
The deal continues the consolidation of real estate investment trusts (REIT).
""It's pretty apparent that that's the way the REIT world, especially apartments right now, is heading,"" Langbaum said.
In December, Houston-based Cambden Property Trust said it would acquire Dallas-based Paragon Group Inc., to create an apartment real estate trust with 36,199 units.
Unlike the hostile takeover Zell's Manufactured Home Communites Inc. launched against Chateau Properties Inc., which was rebuffed by the manufactured housing community operator last year, the Equity Residential deal was unanimously approved by both companies' boards of trustees, the companies said.

3,"Riding a crest of popular vehicles, Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, but special charges held the automaker back from its best-ever full-year profit.
The U.S. No. 3 automaker earned $807 million, or $1.12 per share, during the fourth quarter after $279 million in charges. Excluding those charges, Chryler's operating earnings were a record $1.09 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Chrysler posted net income of $1.04 billion, or $1.33 a share.
Chrysler stock jumped $1.625 to $36.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
""Our 1996 results were outstanding in virtually every respect thanks to what is arguably the strongest product lineup in the industry and to the dedication of our people who have worked so hard to get us where we are today,"" Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement.
Chrysler reported full-year 1996 net income of $3.53 billion, or $4.74 per share.
The automaker's 1996 profit fell short of its 1994 record of $3.71 billion because of $347 million in special charges taken during 1996. On a pretax basis, Chrysler earned $6.09 billion for all of 1996, a new calendar-year record that topped 1995's $3.45 billion.
The company, which had its most recent brush with bankruptcy in 1991, rewarded its U.S. employees handsomely in 1996 with average profit-sharing checks of $7,900 -- more than double the $3,200 they received in 1995.
Based on pretax earnings, Chrysler said the profit sharing was below the $8,000 it paid out for 1994 because more employees will share in the profits. About 79,000 hourly and salaried workers in the United States will receive their payments in February. Two years ago, Chrysler issued profit sharing checks to 75,200 workers in the United States.
During the fourth quarter, Chrysler's profit was reduced by $279 million in charges that covered the early retirement of debt; higher United Auto Workers pension costs; a voluntary early retirement program; and the write-down of Pentastar Electronics, a subsidiary sold to a Huntsville, Ala., investor group for $17 million.
Excluding the charges, Chrysler earned $1.09 billion, or $1.51 a share, in the quarter and $3.88 billion, or $5.21, for the year, beating two-year-old records for operating results.
Wall Street cheered the results, which beat analysts' fourth-quarter consensus operating estimate of $1.43 a share.
John Casesa, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim, said the most impressive news was an increase in the quarter's gross profit margin to 22.3 percent from 20.8 percent -- thanks to high-profit vehicles such as the Ram pickup trucks and minivans.
""The highlight was the company's gross margin was very good, and that reflects a continued rich product mix,"" he said.
Eaton told reporters in a conference call that Chrysler's financial position was so strong it might not need to dip into its approximately $7 billion cash reserve to fund operations and stay profitable during the next industry downturn.
""That would allow us to use a significant portion of our cash reserves for growth opportunities that might just occur during such a downturn,"" Eaton said.
Casesa said it was the first time Eaton has made such a prediction. ""It would be the first time in decades any automaker would have been able to do that,"" Casesa said.
He added that growth opportunities could include purchasing vehicle assembly capacity cheaply from a competitor that needed to unload a costly plant during a recession.
Chrysler attributed its strong performance to a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales, to 2,958,800 from 2,673,539 in 1995.
Based on strong sales of trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans, Chrysler's share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market climbed to 16.1 percent for the year from 14.7 percent in 1995.
Eaton said in a statement the company would not rest on its laurels.
""There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products,"" Eaton said. ""That's the challenge we're all focused on and its one I'm confident we'll meet.""

3,"Investors pushed General Motors Corp. shares higher Monday, a sign that Wall Street is pleased that the auto giant signed a new national labour agreement that allows it to shed some workers.
GM's shares traded up $1.50 at $55.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company signed the tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union early Saturday morning.
""The Wall Street reaction reflects some belief that GM didn't cave in,"" said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. ""GM appears to have retained its right to manage and indulge in some outsourcing.""
Analysts said the pact will allow GM to reduce its 215,000-member hourly work force by 30,000 or more during the next three years through normal retirements.
The pact contains a nominal guarantee that GM maintain employment of about 95 percent of its current work force -- a pattern set in the Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. agreements -- but it also allows GM to exit some unprofitable parts businesses and sell certain components plants.
David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, said he believes the pact will help GM to to boost efficiency.
""GM can use attrition to shrink its work force and take advantage of productivity improvements,"" Cole said. ""The UAW has as much interest in a competitive General Motors as the shareholders do.""
But the positive reaction was tempered by a continuing strike at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where 4,809 workers walked off the job Oct. 29 over demands for more jobs.
The plant makes the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utilities, which are among GM's most popular -- and most profitable -- vehicles. UAW Local 95 wants GM to hire more workers in Janesville to reduce the strain of heavy overtime and an increasing workload.
On Sunday, members of UAW Local 23 returned to work at a key metal stamping plant in Indianapolis after ratifying a settlement on a new local contract.
The union members had struck for five days, shutting off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck assembly plants.
By the weekend, strike-caused parts shortages forced GM to shut down factories in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio, and Linden, N.J.
GM said the Fort Wayne and Moraine plants are scheduled to resume normal operations Tuesday, while Shreveport and Linden will be running again by Thursday.
Last week, the UAW walkouts and lingering parts shortages from last month's Canadian Auto Workers strike had idled nearly 38,000 GM workers in the United States.
GM did not say how many workers were still idle, but added that four car plants stricken by the CAW strike will be back to full production by Tuesday, including Detroit; Lordstown, Ohio; and Lake Orion and Lansing, Mich.
Healy estimated that between the two walkouts, GM's production losses will total 175,000 cars and trucks, which will slash the company's fourth-quarter profits by $600 million to $650 million.
In contrast to the tense atmosphere that continues to surround the GM labour situation, UAW President Stephen Yokich and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton signed a new three-year contract in an historic ceremony at the union's Detroit headquarters.
The signing marked the first time that a Big Three automaker has signed a new labour accord at the UAW's Solidarity House.
Yokich and Eaton were in a jovial mood as they signed the pact -- a stark contrast to the separate, grim-faced news conferences where the UAW and GM announced their deal early Saturday morning.
Yokich told reporters the Chrysler signing ""shows that this company recognises the union and wants to work with them.""
Meanwhile, GM declared an unchanged quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share on its $1-2/3 par value common stock.
Some analysts had expected GM's board of directors to increase the annual payout to $2 a share from $1.60 because of its growing cash pile. But Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said the board did not want to disrupt the UAW pact's ratification by giving more cash to shareholders.

3,"General Motors Corp.'s board of directors Monday approved a $2.5 billion stock buyback programme and a 25 percent dividend hike, but the moves apparently were not enough to satisfy Wall Street's inflated expectations.
GM shares were off $1.875 at $60.625 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
""Failure to generate a positive surprise is punished without mercy by the stock market,"" said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy, who noted that GM's moves were widely anticipated.
Some analysts had predicted GM would boost the payout by up to 50 percent and commit to buying back up to $5 billion worth of stock, which pushed GM shares up last week.
The auto giant said the stock repurchases would take place over the next 12 months and at current prices would reduce the number of its automotive shares by slightly more than 5 percent.
GM raised its quarterly dividend on the automotive shares to 50 cents a share from 40 cents previously. It was the third increase since May 1995, but left GM's payout well short of its peak of 75 cents a share in 1989 and 1990.
The automaker does not plan to release its year-end 1996 earnings results until Tuesday, but it said Monday that it ended 1996 with a whopping cash balance of $17 billion, up from $10.2 billion at the end of 1995.
Many analysts had estimated GM's cash pile at $15 billion.
Auto analyst Scott Merlis, president of Merlis Automotive International, said that showed GM had the resources to buy back shares for a long time to come.
""I would see this repurchase as the tip of the iceberg and the first of a sustainable repurchase programme that can boost earnings per share by 5 percent a year,"" Merlis said.
GM Chairman Jack Smith said in a statement that the automaker will consider additional stock buybacks in the future and added that GM's board was committed to enhancing shareholder value.
He also noted that GM's new dividend rate would be sustainable through the ups and downs of the business cycle.
""We intend to pursue the repurchase programme vigorously,"" Smith added. ""The decision to announce a $2.5 billion programme at this time is based on our belief that we can execute a programme of this size quickly and with confidence.""
GM last issued common stock in 1992, offering 50 million shares to raise about $2.1 billion to help carry the automaker through the worst financial crisis in its history. GM has bought back about $800 million in stock over the past two years, but has reissued shares to support employee benefit and executive compensation programmes.
GM's board also raised the dividend on its Class H shares, which are tied to the performance of its Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, to 25 cents a share from 24 cents.
The new dividends on both the Class H and automotive stocks are payable March 10 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 6.

3,"Mary Graessle had wanted a house of her own, so three months ago she took a deep breath and bought a mobile home in Chateau Properties Inc.'s Lake in the Hills community here.
Today, her double-wide, vinyl-sided dwelling, built in a Redman Industries Inc. factory, is at the centre of some of the biggest merger activity ever to hit the manufactured housing industry.
Two competing mobile home community operators -- Sun Communties Inc. and Chicago investor Sam Zell's Manufactured Home Communities Inc., are bidding for Chateau, while Champion Enterprises Inc. recently agreed to acquire Redman in a $315 million stock swap.
The deals are expected to make Auburn Hills-based Champion the nation's largest home manufacturer and whoever buys Chateau will become the largest real estate investment trust in the industry. Some analysts expect Chateau, based in Clinton Township, Mich., to respond to the offers in the next few weeks.
Graessle's purchase decision was based on pure economics. The recently divorced, 48-year-old bookkeeper for a medical equipment firm simply found that she could get more house for her money in a manufactured home. She paid under $60,000 for a three-bedroom, 1,680 square-foot house, versus more than $100,000 for a similarly sized site-built home.
""I had a hard time with it at first. I did not want to move into a trailer park,"" she said. ""But I felt better once I saw this place. It's not junked-up.""
Lake in the Hills, a well-maintained community near Chrysler Corp.'s gleaming new headquarters in one of metro Detroit's hottest real estate markets, is one of a growing number of communities that are helping to revamp the image of mobile homes.
The dwellings that occupy them are no longer the tin boxes they were in the 1960s. They offer cathedral ceilings, drywall interiors, exterior dormers and other features that make them look more like conventional site-built homes.
""This is no longer the trailer of 30 years ago of 'I Love Lucy' fame,"" noted Champion Chief Executive Walter Young.
For the first six months of 1996, manufactured homes made up about 24 percent of U.S. housing starts and 32 percent of all sales of new homes.
Industry executives believe they can account for 30 percent of new housing starts in the next several years, although growth in home shipments has slowed to 9.5 percent this year from 20 percent two years ago.
Walter Wells, chief executive officer of Middlebury, Ind.-based Schult Homes Corp., said he believes the recent merger activity is the result of the industry's profit potential and shows it is losing its trailer-park stigma.
""Fundamentally, the industry continues to gain share of single-family housing starts,"" Wells said. ""It's doing that because the product offered to consumers these days matches what a house should be -- it looks like a house, it has all the amenities of a site-built house and it offers a better value per square foot.""
According to the Manufactured Housing Institute, the average price per square foot for a multi-section mobile home was $26.79, versus $56.28 for a site-built home, excluding land costs. The average multi-section home sold for $45,900, compared with $119,025 for a site-built home, excluding land costs.
The industry's growth also is a boon to suppliers. Grand Rapids, Mich.-based Universal Forest Products Inc., which makes 60 percent of the roof trusses used in manufactured homes, last month reported a 55 percent gain in second-quarter earnings to $8.2 million.
The industry's growth in urban areas, however, could be limited by difficulties in obtaining and development approvals for new manufactured home communities. Conventional homeowners still worry that nearby manufactured homes will drag down their property values.
""Zoning remains difficult to achieve,"" said Jeffrey Jorissen, chief financial officer for Farmington Hills, Mich.-based Sun Communities. ""It's the not-in-my backyard syndrome.""
But that has also created an opportunity for mobile home community operators because the limited supply of parks maintains strong demand for prime suburban home sites.
That allows firms like Sun and Chateau to increase land rents annually for homeowners like Graessle. She pays about $370 a month for her large lot, which offers backyard views of a pond and a stand of trees.
A prime location also means that her home is more likely to appreciate in value. Although such dwellings have steel frames that allow them to be transported, few are ever moved because of the prohibitive cost -- $4,000 to $10,000.
Graessle, herself a sceptic at first, said her total costs, between $700 and $800 a month for mortgage and land rent, are tough to beat.
""For what you pay for an apartment, you're getting three times the size and you own it,"" she said.
"
3,"General Motors Corp. workers remained on the job without a contract Monday as United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich refrained -- for now -- from calling a strike against the auto giant.
Negotiations on a new national labor contract covering GM's 215,000 UAW hourly workers recessed early Monday after a midnight strike deadline passed. Yokich said some bargainers would resume talks later in the day.
""The only place you can settle these agreements is at the bargaining table,"" Yokich told a news conference early Monday. ""We feel that with or without a contract in place, we can continue (working). It's open-ended.""
The union plans to bring its plant-level leaders to Detroit for a meeting on the talks on Saturday, a move that typically comes after a tentative agreement is reached.
Although Yokich played down the threat of a strike on Monday, he said some of the more than 100 local unions at GM plants may resort to walkouts unless the automaker meets union demands in separate negtiations for local labor agreements.
The local talks have become a sticking point for the national negotiations, Yokich said, because only a few of the locals have signed agreements with GM.
The local pacts typically cover plant-specific issues such as work rules and health and safety standards, while the national contract covers wages, benefits, job security and other common issues.
""We decided that some of these locals need to work on these issues probably before we can ever get a settlement,"" Yokich said, declining to identify specific plants or issues.
Nevertheless, he urged anxious UAW members who watched their Canadian counterparts strike for three weeks this month to stay on the job for the time being.
""We hope that everyone understands that we can't do it in the street. It isn't weakness -- we have to do it at the bargaining table,"" he said.
Negotiations at GM's headquarters building here continued for 17 hours until about 2 a.m. EST on Monday, when bargainers began leaving, carrying their overnight bags.
Although some talks were scheduled to resume Monday afternoon, Yokich and other top UAW officers do not plan to return to the bargaining table until Tuesday morning.
In a written statement in response to Yokich's comments, GM Vice President of Personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive.
""We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues,"" Knechtel said.
Yokich chided GM's hard-headed negotiating style as ""typical GM,"" and noted that the union has consistently had a better relationship with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
The UAW wants GM to agree to the same job guarantees granted by Ford and Chrysler, which call for the two companies to guarantee employment for 95 percent of their combined 171,000 UAW members in the United States.
GM has 12 North American parts plants that it considers uncompetitive and wants to exclude several of those facilities from the job guarantee pledges, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell.
Although GM is viewed as the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, Yokich insisted that the auto giant can live with the pattern.
""I think Ford and Chrysler understood when we said we're preparing ourselves and our union to enter the 21st Century with you as partners in the corporation,"" he said. ""I'm not too sure GM understands that. They've always been late bloomers. Maybe they'll get the message sooner or later.""
The UAW's strike threat comes less than a week after GM settled a 20-day strike by the independent Canadian Auto Workers union. The CAW struck over many of the same issues -- job security and shifting jobs to outside suppliers.
UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker said the U.S. union did not feel pressure to get the exact same provisions that GM agreed to in Canada.
GM's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $54 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"
3,"Chrysler Corp., formalising plans to keep President Robert Lutz on its payroll past the age of 65 and develop a new generation of managers, said its board of directors named Lutz vice chairman on Thursday.
The board gave Lutz's title of president to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Eaton, who will take on more day-to-day operating duties. The chief operating officer post that Lutz also held was left vacant.
Lutz, a former Marine fighter pilot who is credited with pumping new life into Chrysler's product development process and making it the most efficient in the industry, is expected to stay on for two more years, a company spokesman said.
Chrysler's board also on Thursday took steps to boost shareholder value by increasing its share buyback programme to $2 billion from $1 billion for 1997, and hiking the annual dividend to $1.60 a share from $1.40.
The new quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share is payable Jan. 15 to stockholders of record as of Dec. 15.
Chrysler said it has now raised its dividend seven times in the past three years and has increased the payout by 433 percent since September 1993. Thursday's actions come about 10 months after the company settled a bitter fight with Las Vegas billionaire Kirk Kerkorian.
Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., the automaker's largest single shareholder, had mounted a hostile takeover attempt of Chrysler last year, complaining the company was not doing enough to reward shareholders. A Tracinda representative could not be reached for comment Thursday.
In its personnel moves, Chrysler switched international and product development duties among two top executives considered to be in line to succeed Eaton some day, Thomas Gale and Francois Castaing.
Gale will trade his duties as head of international operations for Castaing's duties as head of engineering and product development.
Gale, who becomes executive vice president - product development, will retain his control over product design, while Castaing, who becomes executive vice president - international, will retain his control of powertrain operations.
Four other executive vice presidents did not receive job changes. But Chrysler spoksman Arthur Liebler said Gale and Castaing do not have an edge over them to be chosen as Chrysler's next chairman.
Lutz, who turns 65 in February, will report to Eaton and will focus primarily on the automaker's product development activities, and will serve as a ""coach, mentor and advisor,"" the company said in a statement.
""As vice chairman, Bob will focus his considerable talents on the product development process ... specifically on making sure we retain our product edge well into the 21st Century,"" Eaton said in a statement.
""He will continue as a member of the Office of the Chairman and as a director of the Company and will continue to be involved in all major decisions,"" Eaton said.
Industry analysts said the moves were aimed at allowing Chrysler to continue to take advantage of Lutz' skills while not eliminating any prospective future chairmen.
""They've really kept out of a sort of hysterical concern about where people fit in the organisation -- and that might not be too bad,"" said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Centre for the Study of Automotive Transporation.
Cole theorised Chrysler may never hand out the president title to a rising executive, thus allowing its executive vice presidents to concentrate on their current jobs.
""What they're really doing is managing the transition from the old Chrysler to the new one,"" he said.
"
3,"Chrysler Corp Vice Chairman Robert Lutz, who recently throttled back on his corporate responsibilities, said Tuesday he still sees himself as an integral part of Chrysler's product creation activities.
""I don't see that anything changed,"" Lutz told Reuters in an interview at Detroit's North American International Auto Show. As of January 1, Lutz gave up his president and chief operating officer titles to become vice chairman in anticipation of his 65th birthday in February.  
Although Lutz is largely credited with turning around Chrysler's product development operations by instituting a system of super-efficient ""platform teams"" to bring each new vehicle to market, he said he rarely gives orders to subordinates.
He said he will continue to act as a coach and mentor for the engineers and product executives responsible for new products.
Lutz said he and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton ""are really more cheerleaders and coaches rather than the captain of the team that's out on the field actually playing.  
Eaton took over Lutz's chief operating officer duties and now has several executive vice presidents reporting directly to him.
Lutz said the new structure will give Eaton a chance to work more closely with the executive vice presidents, which will ease the transition to the next generation of leadership. He declined to comment on which executive vice presidents -- who include product development chief Thomas Gale, international chief Francois Castaing and sales and marketing chief James Holden -- have the best shot at succeeding the 57-year-old Eaton as the company's next chief executive.  
Lutz said he will probably stay at Chrysler for at most two ""I have to use to use this transitional period to ease myself out gradually, because the harsh reality is that I cannot stay around until I'm 70,"" he said. ""I would be seriously worried about a company that had its product fortunes guided by a 70-year-old guy. That usually results in cars directed at 70-year-olds.""
Lutz said he will probably become less involved in Chrysler's manufacturing operations, but will probably spend more time visiting Chrysler's international operations, an area in which he has more expertise.
"
3,"Labor negotiations between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers went around the clock into early Saturday morning as pressure from strike-related production losses mounted on the world's largest car maker.
Bargainers at GM's world headquarters were said to be haggling over a list of plants that GM wants to exclude from employment guarantees in the three-year national contract covering 215,000 hourly workers.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly work forces, but GM wants to exclude several parts plants from the guarantees, including a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., now on the sale block.
""It ain't done yet,"" one union negotiator at GM's Detroit headquarters said on Friday night.
GM spokesman Gerry Holmes declined to rule out a settlement early on Saturday, but would not characterize the progress of the discussions.
Bargainers struggled for nearly 45 hours from Wednesday through Friday over the proposed exceptions to the pattern, which was aimed at allowing GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, to cut costs and boost productivity.
Although all three of the companies pay a base wage of about $19 an hour, Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from lower-cost outside suppliers than GM does.
On Friday, the UAW signaled that the talks had hit a snag when it canceled a Saturday meeting of plant-level leaders here.
The UAW said its 250-member National GM Council is now scheduled to meet on Wednesday, Nov. 6, in Chicago if the union reaches a tentative agreement in the next few days. The cancellation was viewed as a negative sign for a quick settlement because it buys significantly more time to craft a deal.
Meanwhile, pressure from local strikes in Indiana and Wisconsin mounted early Saturday as the number of workers idled by the walkouts exceeded 19,000.
By late in the evening, workers at seven plants were idled, including 2,750 strikers in Indianapolis and 4,800 in Janesville, Wis.
The Indianapolis plant feeds fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck plants, including Janesville.
GM's Shreveport, La., compact pickup truck plant also shut down Friday, idling 2,400 workers, while GM's Linden, N.J., plant, which employs about 2,500 workers, was expected to run out of parts Friday night. Linden produces Chevrolet and GMC compact pickups and sport utility vehicles.
About 3,500 workers were idled at GM's Moraine, Ohio, compact sport utility vehicle plant Thursday night, while 2,250 workers were laid off at GM's Fort Wayne, Ind., full-size pickup truck assembly plant on Wednesday night.
In addition, 900 workers who build V-8 engines for trucks assembled in Janesville and Fort Wayne were idled on Friday.
Michael Ward, an auto analyst at Paine Webber, said the Janesville, Fort Wayne and Moraine shutdowns alone will cost GM $10 million a day in after-tax lost profits.
""We're looking at $10 million a day right now, and that could easily expand to $20 million by Monday,"" Ward said.
Full-size pickup truck plants in Flint and Pontiac, Mich., and Oshawa, Ontario, could run out of parts within the next several days, while a GM truck plant in Silao, Mexico, was believed to have a greater supply of parts on hand.
Layoffs from the UAW strikes were increasing as GM's U.S. car operations are still staggering from the effects of the three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike, which ended Oct. 23.
GM said it still had 18,958 workers idled by continuing shortages of Canadian-made parts at six car assembly plants, six engine and transmission plants and four metal stamping facilities. Lost profits associated with the Canadian walkout are estimated at more than $350 million.
"
3,"General Motors Corp. was expected to seek bids for its Hughes Electronics Corp. defence businesses in the first of several transactions aimed at shedding GM's remaining non-automotive assets, analysts said Thursday.
The possible sale of Hughes' defence operations for as much as $8 billion was the latest of several scenarios that have emerged in recent months regarding GM's plans for Hughes, which it bought in 1985 for about $5 billion.
""I think the GM board and Hughes Electronics management are very interested in divesting the defence business, merging the Delco Electronics unit with the Delphi components business, and spinning off the communications business into a separate company,"" said CS First Boston defence analyst Peter Aseritis.
""My sense is that they want to find a merger partner for the defence business first,"" he added.
Analysts said several candidates could be interested in Hughes' defence units, including McDonnell Douglas Corp., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp.
GM declined to comment on the idea of splitting off the defence business, first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
""I have to classify it all in the realm of speculation, for which we have no comment,"" said GM spokeswoman Toni Simmonetti in New York.
However, GM disclosed in recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings that Hughes wants to ""strengthen its leadership position through acquisitions, consolidations, realignments and divestitures,"" among other actions.
Hughes' missile systems, radar, electronic warfare, thermal imaging, information systems and other defence units, which earned operating profits of $688 million on revenues of $5.95 billion in 1995, are regarded as attractive plums in a consolidating defence industry.
McDonnell Douglas, which many analysts said was ready for an acquisition, declined to confirm any specific bidding activity, but said it was interested in Hughes. McDonnell President Harry Stonecipher ""has gone on record saying that he is interested in making an acquisition. He finds Hughes an interesting choice,"" a McDonnell spokeswoman said.
But analysts cautioned that any transaction involving Hughes would be complicated, because of tax considerations for GM and its Class H shareholders.
Under a complex ownership structure, shareholders of GM Class H stock are entitled to dividends based on Hughes' earnings while GM owns the subsidiary's assets. Thus an outrightright sale would create a major tax liability for GM.
For that reason, analysts said GM was more likely to pursue a non-cash transaction, such as a stock swap or other type of deal that could take some time to structure.
""Clearly I would personally be surprised if there was an outright sale,"" said BT Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch.
A sale of the defence business would clear the way for GM to fold its Delco Electronics unit, which makes audio systems and other components, back into its Delphi Automotive Systems auto parts unit.
That would leave Hughes' lucrative telecommunications and space segment, which has been soaring on the growth of its DirecTV satellite broadcasting service. Those operations may be spun off into a separate company, analysts said.
"
3,"Trampling a half-century of tradition, United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich is reinventing the way the union negotiates its biggest and richest contract.
At every turn in the triennial ritual of labor negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers, Yokich has surprised industry observers with new, ground-breaking twists, such as dispensing with the traditional concept of a ""strike target.""
On Tuesday, he quietly anointed Ford Motor Co. to lead the negotiations for a new contract covering over 385,000 workers. At the same time, the UAW will continue talks with General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. -- leaving the door slightly open for them to come up with a last minute offer and putting subtle pressure on Ford.
""Yokich is an unusually confident and bold leader,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley. ""He knows where he wants to go, and if a precedent is preventing from getting there, he throws it out.""
The 61-year-old Yokich, who became the UAW's eighth president last year, has even downplayed the importance of enforcing a strict pattern agreement at all three automakers -- something held sacred by the UAW for decades.
Every three years since roughly the end of World War II, the UAW has selected a strike target to hammer out a pattern agreement for all three companies, with the threat of a national strike if talks run past contract's expiration.
In many cases, the contracts were negotiated partly through the media, with both sides publicly castigating each other.
""I remember back in the early to mid-80s, it was an 'I'll take whatever I can get' attitude on both sides,"" said PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward.
But Yokich prefers to duck the media limelight and has gone out of his way to show that he doesn't want a strike, even to the point of saying that he has banishing the word ""strike target"" from his vocabulary.
""Our members didn't elect us to go out on strike, they elected us to bring them an agreement,"" Yokich said last month.
Yokich, who worked as a tool and die maker before entering union politics, has a close relationship with Peter Pestillo, Ford executive vice president of corporate relations, which analysts believe will help smooth the way for a quick settlement.
Indeed, UAW officials in recent days say that with less than two weeks to go before the contract expires Sept. 14, bargainers at all three companies are closer to agreements than at the same point in any prior negotiation year.
There may be other breakthroughs -- the UAW and Ford have discussed the possibility of a longer contract of up to five or six years, and Ford has shown some willingness to encourage suppliers to allow the UAW to organize their plants.
Labor analysts said they expect him to come up with an agreement that provides some improved job security for UAW members, but will not hamstring the automakers' competitiveness.
""Yokich is a fairly sensible negotiator,"" Ward said. ""He has a big-picture view of the industry.""
He also has a big-picture view of labor, causing him to embark last year on what may one day be viewed as his greatest accomplishment, the proposed merger of the UAW, the United Steel Workers and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers into a giant metal trades union with over 2 million members.
Retired UAW leaders applaud Yokich's new direction and do not view him as tearing down their legacy.
""He's breaking out of the mold and trying something different,"" Doug Fraser, who was the UAW president in the late 1970s and early 1980s. ""In my view it can only be positive.""
"
11,"CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. said Monday they had entered discussions about their rival offers to buy Conrail Inc.
The two railroads did not disclose the specific nature of their talks, but Conrail's stock fell on views that the discussions would dampen the prospects of a bidding war for the Philadelphia-based railroad.
A source familiar with the companies said the discussions began late last week, continued through the weekend and into Monday.
Richmond, Va.-based CSX last month struck an agreement to buy Conrail in a $8.4 billion cash and stock transaction that valued Conrail at $92.50 per share. Norfolk Southern soon launched its own bid of $100 cash per share, or about $9 billion.
Since then, the two companies have been locked in a fight over their rival offers and taken the matter to court.
CSX, which said Norfolk Southern initiated the talks, said the discussions concerned ""a possible sale by the post-merger CSX/Conrail of certain material assets.""
Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern sought to quell speculation that it would abandon its bid for Conrail, saying that it was committed to its offer and has secured more than $15 billion to finance the proposed acquisition.
Norfolk Southern said the talks were started by CSX, adding that they were aimed at promoting competition.
""Our willingness to talk to CSX at its suggestion is consistent with my previously announced position that Conrail cannot be acquired by either CSX or NS without a plan to maintain a balanced competitive structure for Eastern railroad service. While I am heartened by CSX's willingness to discuss these matters, we have no reason to believe that Conrail is prepared to accept that reality,"" said Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode.
A battle for Conrail is viewed as being rife with difficulties for all the companies. Although Norfolk Southern has a higher offer on the table, analysts have said that Pennsylvania's corporate takeover law could be an obstacle to its proposed acquisition.
""This is not a good time to be having a long, drawn-out fight. The quicker they get to this, the better,"" said analyst Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.
Conrail shares had partly recovered from the early steep fall by late afternoon, trading down $1.50 per share at $93.75 on NYSE. CSX rose $1.50 to $44.50 and Norfolk Southern gained $1.375 to $90.75, also on the NYSE.
"
11,"Western Resources Inc. on Wednesday offered to buy ADT Ltd. in a $3.5 billion cash and stock transaction that would transform the Kansas utility into the nation's top provider of electronic security services.
The move marks the latest step in Western's aggressive strategy to dominate the highly fragmented security industry, which has grown increasingly attractive to utilities and telecommunication companies.
Topeka, Kansas-based Western Resources, which already holds a 27 percent stake in ADT, said it would take its unsolicited offer directly to ADT shareholders. It also said it would call a special meeting of shareholders to replace the existing ADT board of directors.
""We have demonstrated our belief in ADT's future through our investment. The benefits of this transaction are compelling, offering a natural extension of our respective businesses,"" Western Resources Chairman John Hayes said in a statement.
Hayes advised ADT of its offer in a letter in which he noted that ADT previously said it was not interested in a transaction with Western Resources.
""Now, after careful study and consideration, we have determined that the potential benefits to ADT, Western Resources and ADT's other shareowners from a combination of Western Resources and ADT are simply too compelling to ignore,"" Hayes wrote to ADT Chairman Michael Ashcroft. ""We firmly believe that this combination will provide significant benefits to our respective shareowners, customers and employees not available to either company on its own.""
Western said it would pay $22.50 for each share of ADT, consisting of $15 in Western Resources common stock and $7.50 cash. The offer would give ADT holders a 12 percent premium over Tuesday's closing stock price of $20.125 on NYSE.
ADT climbed $2.625 to $22.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Western Resources' stock was unchanged at $31.25.
Western's proposal also calls for ADT shareholders to receive the equivalent of a 99 cents per ADT share annual dividend. ADT does not presently pay a dividend.
Boca Raton, Fla.-based ADT said it would review the offer in due course and advised shareholders to await a recommendation from its board.
The offer for ADT marks the second security acquisition proposal made this week by Western Resources. On Monday, Western Resources announced plans to buy the security business of Westinghouse Electric Corp. for $368 million in cash.
Long considered a premier property in the electronic security industry, ADT earlier this year was to be acquired by Republic Industries Inc. for $5 billion. But that transaction collapsed in September after months of uncertainty due to stock price volatility.
Western Resources has been aggressively pursuing deals in other areas. It has mounted a $1.9 billion takeover bid for Kansas City. Mo.-based Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co.
Last week, Western Resources agreed to sell its natural gas assets to Oklahoma-based Oneok Inc. in a $660 million deal in which Western Resources will take a large stake in Oneok, the parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. The utility's customers could become clients for Western Resources' other services, such as home security.

11,"Shares of American Medical Response Inc fell sharply Wednesday for a second consecutive session amid concern that the ambulance company was straying from its successful acquisition strategy.
The steep decline came after American Medical Response announced Tuesday an agreement to buy STAT Healthcare Inc in a stock transaction valued at $145 million.
The planned acquisition moves American Medical Response, which has bought 69 ambulance companies since 1992, into hospital emergency rooms and disease management.  
Shares of American Medical Response tumbled 2-5/8 to 31-7/8 by midafternoon Wednesday. The stock dropped three points after the transaction was announced on Tuesday.
Wall Street analysts said the deal was strategically sound from a long-term perspective, but noted that investors were wary of the company's shift into a new area.
""The skepticism, which we don't share, is related to the company's going into a business outside their consolidation within the ambulance industry,"" said Randall Huyser of Furman Selz.  
STAT Healthcare provides staffing for hospital emergency rooms. It also offers outpatient medical services such as kidney dialysis.
""Although the transaction makes sense to us conceptually, this new direction for the company may elicit a wait-and-see attitude from some investors who want to see success first in the new venture. Others may question how the disease management division will fit into the puzzle,"" Lehman Brothers analyst Jeffrey Kessler wrote in a report issued Wednesday.
Industry sources also cited the company's prediction the deal will slightly dilute earnings this year.  
In a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, American Medical Response said the transaction would be accretive in 1997. It also expects cost savings of $2.5 million from the merger.
Industry analysts also noted that the acquisition would mark a logical extension of the company's existing services.
""They're taking it beyond just driving you to the hospital,"" said Clifford Hewitt of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co Inc.

The founder of Blockbuster Entertainment and owner of the Florida Marlins baseball team announced earlier that his Republic Industries Inc had signed a definitive pact to buy privately-held Alamo Rent-A-Car for $625 million.
The move is expected to catapult Republic's growing automotive business, which is rooted in used-car company AutoNation USA.

11,"French holding company CGIP said on Friday it could strike a deal in the next few weeks to acquire a 28 percent stake in automotive parts firm Valeo SA from Italian businessman Carlo De Benedetti.
In a meeting with reporters, CGIP chairman Ernest-Antoine Seilliere described negotiations as nearing a ""momentum.""
""In the coming weeks, we could come to a conclusion,"" he said. He said it would be a longterm investment for CGIP.
Seilliere declined to discuss a potential price for the stake owned by De Benedetti's holding company Cerus.  
CGIP's efforts to buy a piece of Valeo moved a step closer late Thursday, when it sold half of its 20 percent stake in Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co Inc for $560.6 million.
CGIP has said that profits from the sale would be used to finace the stake in Valeo.
""Now we have sold part of our assets, obviously we are seen as serious to buy Valeo, but we still have a way to go. We are serious about what we are doing,"" Seilliere said.
CGIP is a holding company with industrial and information technology investments.
Seilliere said the purchase of a stake in Valeo would fit its strategy to invest in firms that have a global presence. Seventy percent of Valeo's business is outside of France, he said.
He also dismissed the potential of Valeo falling prey to the cyclical nature of the autmotive business, saying that opportunities abound in growing economies around the world.
He noted that CGIP previously held a stake in Valeo and sold it in 1993. He also said that the company does not need any significant productivity or organizational changes.  
Although Seilliere appeared hopeful that a deal for the Valeo stake will be struck, he also said that CGIP would certainly consider another investment if the Valeo acquisition falls apart. He did not name any potential companies.
Regarding its stake in Crown Cork, which now totals 10.1 percent, Seilliere said CGIP's relationship with company had not been affected by the partial sale of its investment.
""Our team is still there. Nothing has changed,"" he said, noting that CGIP still has more than $600 million invested in the company.
CGIP decided to sell a portion of its Crown Cork &amp; Seal holdings after investors and analysts expressed concern that packaging had grown to 50 percent of CGIP's assets, up from about 21 percent in 1986, Seilliere said.

11,"Conrail Inc. on Friday spurned a sweetened $10.5 billion takeover offer from hostile suitor Norfolk Southern Corp. amid speculation that a 2-month-old bidding war for the railroad was drawing to a close.
As expected, Conrail rejected the offer and contended that its proposed friendly $9.3 billion merger with CSX Corp. would be a better corporate combination.
""The Conrail board has again confirmed that a merger of equals with CSX and not a sale to Norfolk Southern is in the best interests of Conrail and its constituencies, including shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and communities served,"" Conrail Chairman David LeVan said in a statement.
The rejection came just one day after both CSX and Norfolk Southern raised their bids for Conrail.
Industry analysts said CSX and Norfolk Southern were unlikely to offer much more for the Philadelphia-based railroad, but both sides will pursue the fight in court, before regulators and in the marketplace.
""That is the whole process that takes place over the course of 1997 -- the battle for market share as opposed to Conrail shares,"" said NatWest Securities Corp. analyst Anthony Hatch.
On Thursday, Richmond, Va.-based CSX raised its offer for Conrail to give shareholders an extra $870 million in the cash-and-stock merger. Based on Friday's stock activity, the deal is worth $9.3 billion, or about $102 per Conrail share.
A source close to CSX told Reuters then that CSX and Conrail hoped the revised deal would end the bidding war.
But just hours after CSX and Conrail unveiled the new terms of their planned merger, Norfolk Southern raised its all-cash offer by $500 million to about $10.5 billion, or $115 a share.
""If someone were to start to bid higher than this, they probably wouldn't get the economies out of the deal to make it work, so the bidding war, I think, has come to the end,"" said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group.
Although Norfolk Southern's bid has been higher throughout the two-month takeover fight, Conrail contends the union with CSX is a better strategic fit.
Industry experts said Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern, which has the financial power to bid more than $10.5 billion, merely wants to preserve the spread between the two offers while it fights a key aspect of the Conrail-CSX pact in court.
Norfolk Southern is challenging part of the transaction that prohibits either CSX or Conrail from seeking another merger partner before 1999.
Some analysts and investors said that if the exclusivity provision is not thrown out after a Jan. 9 hearing before a federal judge in Philadelphia, it could guarantee a victory for CSX because shareholders would not wait two years for a deal with Norfolk Southern.
Norfolk Southern last month lost a court fight in which it challenged previous terms of the deal, including an exclusivity provision that ruled out other talks before July 1997.
""This is a sign that they're not going to go bananas (with a very high offer). If they're able to break the lock-up provision, they have a good bid,"" Hatch said.
""It was the right thing to do to keep pressure on the (Conrail) board,"" said one takeover stock trader, referring to investors who were unhappy with Conrail's decision to pursue the lower of the two bids.
The court case is expected to hinge on whether Conrail's agreeing to the extended exclusivity period falls within the broad discretion allowed a board under Pennsylvania law, said Charles Yablon, a professor of corporate law at Cardozo University in New York.
""They're pushing the outside of the envelope and trying to take maximum advantage of the leeway that Pennsylvania law gives them,"" Yablon said. But if they can legally justify the move, CSX will probably prevail in court, he said.
Few Wall Street analysts were predicting the outcome, but the war was expected to drag on no matter which company wins in court.
After the court fight, the next battle site will be Washington where the losing bidder is expected to vehemently challenge the merger. The deal already is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that oversees railroads.
""You're going to have a lot of opposition to this,"" PNC's Vincent said, citing railroads, shippers and state agencies which are expected to express their opinions when the transaction reaches the regulatory stage.
Last week, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it would intervene in any merger involving Conrail.
Conrail stock fell 87.5 cents to $99.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock fell 50 cents to $43.25 and Norfolk Southern shares rose $1.125 to $89.50, also on NYSE.

11,"When ITT broke into three companies in 1995, top executives said the move would increase value for stockholders, fuel growth and make the separate businesses more competitive.
But independence has come at a high price for the former conglomerate's hotel, casino and entertainment division known as ITT Corp. Industry competition is fiercer than ever before, a huge expansion plan has been unexpectedly difficult, and the company's stock price has eroded dramatically in the past few months.  
And now, rival Hilton Hotels Corp is prepared to launch a $6.5 billion hostile takeover of the company whose assets include some of the world's best-known properties - from the New York Knicks to Sheraton hotels to Madison Square Garden.
""ITT has always bought the highest-quality assets. When they go out and buy something, they always buy the best and they've always paid a lot of money for those assets - maybe too much - but the bottom line is they own some top quality assets,"" said Bruce Raabe of Collins &amp; Co.  
It is the appeal of those assets and the view that they should be contributing more to the company's bottom line that may make ITT vulnerable, industry experts said.
So far, ITT has said little about the Hilton offer other than it will consider it. A source familiar with ITT said its board has a regularly scheduled meeting next Tuesday.
An ITT spokesman could not be reached for comment.
But industry analysts widely believe the $55 cash and stock offer made by Hilton undervalues the company. Shares of ITT soared 14-1/4 to 56-7/8 on views that any transaction will come at a higher price than the Monday offer.  
Wall Street sources knowledgeable about ITT's operations admit the giant company has faltered in recent months even as it has pursued an aggressive path of expansion. The company, which has earmarked $2.5 billion for expansion, lost out to Hilton in a bid for Bally Entertainment Corp and has suffered construction project setbacks and losses from its high-stakes bacarrat tables in Las Vegas.
""Remember, this company has only been public for a year. The company gets a lot of attention and it doesn't shrink from doing aggressive things,"" said one Wall Street source who did not want to be identified.  
But others said the company's acquisition strategy is not well focused, the construction problems were avoidable and the company's management does not have a strong background in operating casinos. Chief executive Rand Araskog ran the conglomerate since 1979 and took control of the new ITT Corp after overseeing the three-way split. President Robert Bowman is considered to be an extremely savvy financier, but does not comes from the gaming industry.
""This is a team that isn't working very well together. Araskog is the behind-the-desk kind of CEO instead of the kind of guy who's out living and breathing his business. Bowman is working with intellect and energy, but without a good perspective of the business,"" said one industry expert who did not want to be identified.
ITT, which is expected to rebuff the takeover effort, is likely to tout its future plans as an enticement for shareholders.
""The less-than-favorable publicity, some of which has been unfair, that the officers of ITT have received, has overshadowed the fact that management is looking at long-term plans, but fast management is now more respected than long-term planning,"" said Bjorn Hanson, hospitality industry chairman at Coopers &amp; Lybrand.

11,"Healthcare and oil companies are expected to be bigger players in 1997's corporate merger boom, although most of the activity is still likely to be dominated by telecommunications, utilities and insurance.
Several other sectors, including airlines and railroads, also are on the verge of participating in the deal frenzy that has gripped corporate America for nearly two years.
And the merger pace shows no sign of slowing in 1997 from 1996's record, said investment bankers and merger experts.  
""We see no reason why the (merger and acquisition) cycle should slow down.  We think the boom will continue through (1997),"" said Philip Keevil, managing director at Salomon Brothers.
A record $658.8 billion worth of transactions was announced in 1996, far surpassing initial expectations for the year, according to figures compiled by Securities Data Co, a Newark, N.J.-based firm that tracks deals.
The key driver in the current merger trend has been the high-flying stock market, coupled with corporate trends that stress consolidation and cost-cutting.  
""At the beginning of 1996, it looked like it would be another good year for mergers.  That got blown to pieces. It's hard to know if (1997) will be better, but it feels real good,"" said Steven Wolitzer, managing partner and co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Lehman Brothers.
Industry experts said the pipeline for potential deals appears full for at least the first six months of 1997.
""We're at a really high level of activity.  There is good corporate profitability and people are using their money for share buybacks and acquisitions,"" said Robert Lovejoy, managing director at Lazard Freres &amp; Co.  
And investors like to see acquisitions.
""Shareholders expect managements to be taking pro-active steps to generate value-enhancing transactions.  And the management of these corporations realize they can't count on the stock market"" to boost profitability, said Bruce Nolop, managing director at Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co.
Federal deregulation is expected to drive more consolidation in telecommunications and utilities, two of the most active sectors in 1996.  The telecommunications sector rang up the biggest deals of 1996 and the utilities industry also played a large role in the year's transactions.  
Although healthcare companies already have participated in the merger boom, experts anticipate more consolidation among pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
Merger experts also predict energy companies, which spent much of 1996 forming alliances and divesting properties, will become more aggressive buyers and sellers in 1997.  The nation's refiners, plagued with poor profit margins, especially are expected to participate in the merger trend.
Meanwhile, the prospect of mergers is hovering over the nation's airlines.
Industry experts believe airline industry consolidation is inevitable, especially as AMR Corp's American Airlines subsidiary and British Airways Plc pursue a wide-reaching partnership.
Similarly, a resolution if the takeover battle for Conrail Inc will likely trigger other railroad mergers, experts said. CSX Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp are locked in a bidding war for Conrail and the losing railroad is likely to seek another partner.

11,"Rite Aid Corp said it plans to swiftly integrate Thrifty PayLess Inc into its already-powerful company by attacking weaknesses in the regional drugstore chain's distribution and technology.
""To make this acquisition work, we have to reduce costs and we have to reduce costs rapidly,"" Rite Aid chief executive officer Martin Grass told more than 250 investors and analysts in a conference call.
In the latest drugstore merger to sweep the industry, Rite Aid announced plans to buy Thrifty PayLess for $1.4 billion.  
U.S. drugstores are consolidating at a feverish pace as the result of pricing pressures and costly computer upgrades that are essential in today's world of managed healthcare.
Industry analysts said Thrifty PayLess has been plagued by a weak distribution system and inefficient technology.
""It is our belief that our technology is a lot more sophisticated than what is being used at Thrifty PayLess and that there are significant benefits that we can bring -- not only to the store operations, but also to the customers,"" Grass said.  
Analysts expect Rite Aid to make significant progress reducing the Thrifty PayLess cost structure even though savings will not come from geographic overlap.  Rite Aid does not have any stores in Thirfty PayLess' West Coast markets.
""No one is as lean as Rite Aid,"" said Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group.
But the proposed acquisition may create some new difficulties for Rite Aid, which typically has smaller stores and less varied merchandise than Thrifty PayLess.  Unlike Rite Aid, Thrifty PayLess sell plants, ice cream and shoes as well as traditional drugstore items.  
Concerns about Rite Aid's move into these new areas sent the company's stock down two to 33-7/8 in afternoon trade.
""This is something that is entirely outside their realm of experience.  That is a major question mark,"" said Joseph Ronning of Brown Brothers Harriman.
""These are completely different businesses.  These guys are general merchandisers,"" said Gary Vineberg of Merrill Lynch.
Grass addressed those issues in the conference call, saying that Rite Aid may add more merchandise experts to assess the different products.  
""There are certain lines of merchandise that we will continue to carry out West that we don't carry back East,"" Grass said.
Shares of Thrifty PayLess, which made its initial public offering in April at 14 per share, gained three to 21-3/8. Takeover stock traders said the deal values Thrifty PayLess at $23.32 per share.
The proposed acquisition of Thrifty PayLess seems to eliminate Rite Aid as a potential bidder for southeast drugstore chain Big B Inc.  Rite Aid has been viewed as a possible bidder for Big B, which is fighting a hostile takeover from Revco D.S. Inc.
But in announcing the Thrifty PayLess acquisition, Rite Aid also said that it is pulling out of Florida, Alabama and Georgia, which are Big B's key markets.

11,"Ashland Inc has quashed a threatened proxy fight by restucturing its core business, but the independent refiner must still prove its ability to prosper in an industry plagued by poor profit margins.
A series of actions unveiled Monday by Ashland was viewed as a significant step to convince investors that management will not stand by and watch profits erode.
""The question now is whether they can deliver. I think there will be more to come,"" said James Falvey, analyst at Smith Barney.  
Ashland earlier announced a series of steps aimed at enhancing profitability. They included a restructuring of business units, a share buyback program, the evaluation of strategic alternatives for its non-core exploration unit, and a program to evaluate and cut costs.
The Kentucky-based refiner has recently been pressured by a New York investment firm that had nominated a three-person slate for election to the company's board of directors at the January 30 annual meeting.
In announcing the restructuring on Monday, Ashland also announced Providence Capital Inc had withdrawn its slate.  
""They have addressed all the major issues we raised. We feel the plan is genuine and that they are sincere about defining a new era at Ashland,"" Herbert Denton, president of Providence Capital, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Denton said representatives of Ashland met with Providence last week. Ashland also recently has met with institutional investors.
Although shares of Ashland showed little reaction to Monday's plan, analysts noted the stock has risen about $10 per share since September on views of a restructuring. The stock was trading unchanged at 46-5/8 in afternoon trading.  
Analysts widely expect Ashland to sell the exploration unit and participate in widespread consolidation taking place throughout the industry. The company did not disclose any cost-cutting targets or timeframe to implement the actions.
But analysts said the restructuring is a solid reflection on company veteran and chief executive officer Paul Chellgren, who is set to move into the role of chairman to replace retiring John Hall.
""I think this is positive. This is a quicker-than-expected start on restructuring,"" said Fred Leuffer of Bear Stearns &amp; Co, who values the exploration unit at $425 to $450 million.
Analysts also said that the restructuring is likely to be an evolutionary process.
""It's not going to happen tomorrow. The results will prove themselves over time and if they don't, there will be further initiatives,"" said Barry Sahgal of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
Meanwhile, Denton said his group will continue to monitor the company's progress.

12,"International Business Machines Corp. will unveil Tuesday its third generation of its low-cost mainframes, which are almost twice as fast as current models and much-anticipated by Wall Street and IBM customers.
The computer giant, defending its still dominant position in the mainframe market, is also expected to unveil very aggressive pricing of the new systems and analysts expect mainframe prices to continue to decline even further.
""They are coming out with a very aggressive offering,"" said Carl Greiner, a vice president at the Meta Group.
Three years ago, IBM unveiled this lower-cost CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology as the future and gradually its big corporate users have been moving to the new systems, which are less expensive to make. But the CMOS systems were not as powerful as IBM's older bipolar line.
""The big users need something bigger,"" Greiner said. ""We are now getting into the power where most people can use this machine. It will provide for 90 percent of users' needs.""
Mainframes still generate the biggest bulk of IBM's product revenues, even though a few years ago they were declared the dinosaurs of computers by many analysts.
But in the past two to three years, the mainframe has indeed enjoyed a big resurgence, with growing unit volumes, although prices are still in great decline.
Helping fuel the continued interest in the mainframe as the keeper of corporate data are both the lower prices and more software being developed to enable broader access to the giant warehouses of data, including software gateways from the Internet. With IBM's help, mainframes are also being positioned as the biggest servers, or computers that manage a network, in a corporate ""intranet.""
So users have kept buying mainframes with lower prices amid a price war among the main vendors.
Hitachi Ltd. and its new Skyline mainframes have been gaining share at IBM's expense, because Skyline combines the older mainframe technology and the newer low-cost CMOS technology in one system, giving users more processing power.
According to the Meta Group in Stamford, Conn., in 1996, IBM will have about 73 percent of the world mainframe market, down from 81 percent in 1995. Hitachi is expected to jump to 20 percent this year, up from 7 percent last year, while Amdahl's share falls to 7 percent from 12 percent.
""Skyline is more powerful than what IBM ships today,"" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst.
""About half the installed mainframe base hasn't bought CMOS because it wasn't powerful enough.""
So customers have been widely anticipating this latest upgrade of IBM's System 390, as well as Wall Street, which is hoping for a strong fourth quarter, fueled in part by strong mainframe volumes.
Even though the prices continue to fall, analysts said that the CMOS products are more profitable to IBM and its rivals, because they are less costly to make.
""It allows them to address more of the customer base with a more profitable product,"" Milunovich said. ""It's well anticipated by customers.
As part of IBM's announcement, it will also unveil an upgrade of its mainframe operating system, called OS/390, Release 2.0, which will include higher security for software applications using the Internet's World Wide Web.
IBM also plans to introduce Internet gateways to its DB2 database software, the dominant database software for IBM and compatible mainframes, analysts said.
IBM also is expected to unveiled a mainframe version of its high capacity storage system, the Ramac storage device. IBM is hosting conference calls Tuesday for the announcements.

12,"Personal computer makers next week will simultaneously roll out flashy multimedia PCs designed around a new chip by Intel Corp, a move that is expected to give the consumer sector of the industry a much-needed boost.
On Wednesday Intel will officially launch its P55C microprocessor, with its so-called MMX (multimedia extension) technology. A slew of companies will roll out consumer PCs, notebooks and desktops using the new chip, which offers much faster performance than earlier designs.  
""(The impact of MMX) will be significant in the second half,"" said David Wu, a Chicago Corp analyst. ""I should hope it helps -- the corporate world is strong and the retail world is very weak.""
He said there was currently nothing new and sexy to drive sales in the consumer market other than better price performance.
CompUSA Inc on Thursday became the latest retailer to report disappointing sales of PCs during the holiday shopping season, normally the industry's strongest.  
To be sure, analysts said that PC makers with a strong presence in the corporate market would not be hurt very much by the disappointing consumer sales.  
Consumer anticipation of the new PCs was one reason that retailers were showing weaker-than-expected sales, as savvy computer buyers waited for next ""big thing"" to hit the market, analysts said.
In tandem with Intel's announcement, Compaq Computer Corp , Dell Computer Corp, Gateway 2000 Inc, Toshiba America Corp, Sony Corp, International Business Machines Corp and other companies are expected to unveil new high-end PCs, priced at more than $3,000.
On Friday, Intel shares jumped eight to 138-3/8 after two analysts made bullish comments about the company.  
""It's a tremendous kickoff to 1997,"" said Rod Schrock, a vice president of Compaq's Presario division. ""We are so excited about the new MMX processor that we redesigned the entire line of Presarios from the ground up. Customers are going to get a pretty dazzling experience.""
Schrock declined to give any product specifics, but he said that Compaq will launch its Presario consumer PCs with MMX at about the same time as Intel's announcement.
""It should provide an added boost to the demand for the new generation of PCs,"" Schrock added. ""There was no major industry event in 1996. This year you have a new processor.""

12,"Netscape and Microsoft and others agreed on Tuesday that the so-called Internet browser wars were silly, although that did not stop some sparks from flying between the two battling CEOs at a computer conference here.
Microsoft Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. are locked in a few battles over Internet software, with the most attention being paid to the fight for share in the Internet browser market, where Microsoft is an underdog.
""I do think there is a certain silliness about these browser wars,"" said Steve Case, chairman and CEO of America Online Inc, on a panel at a Gartner Group technology symposium here. Case's AOL was one of the first online services to embrace Internet Explorer as its preferred browser software, in exchange for a spot on Microsoft's Windows 95 desktop.
Case said that he believes Microsoft and Netscape will end up with comparable market share and he likened the battle to the set-top box war in the early days of the cable television industry during the 1980s.
Netscape still dominates the Internet browser market with its Navigator software, which has an approximate 70 to 80 percent share of the market.
But Microsoft recently said that its Internet Explorer is gaining momentum, as it continues to sign on more deals to have Internet Explorer bundled as the primary browser with more online services and Internet access providers.
Just last week, Internet Explorer became the preferred browser on AT&amp;T's WorldNet Internet access service, fueling some analysts to say the deal was another blow to Netscape's dominance of the browser market.
James Barksdale, president and CEO of Netscape, pointed out that while the feud between Navigator and Internet Explorer is the ""current blood sport in the popular press,"" he pointed out that 80 percent of Netscape's revenues are from sales to the corporate network or ""intranet"" market.
In that market, Netscape is aiming to hold onto its dominance of the server that runs internal corporate networks and is competing with Microsoft's BackOffice and with International Business Machines Corp's Lotus Notes.
Bill Gates, chairman and CEO of the software behemoth Microsoft, said that the competition between Netscape and Microsoft is good for the market.
""We compete with Netscape and there is a lot of value there,"" he said, adding that Microsoft has many developers working pretty much at ""full speed"" to develop new Internet software. He conceded that in part, the fast-moving competition from Netscape has fueled this intensity.
One area where the sparring companies did agree was on the Internet itself, which both Gates and Barksdale said should remain free of government intervention.
""No one will come to dominate standards on the Internet, that's why it works,"" said Barksdale.
Gates drew laughter when he said that Microsoft, which dominates the operating system arena with Windows software, will still make ""some percent"" of the operating systems. But he also said that ""no one will control the printing presses"" of the Internet.
One Gartner Group analyst asked Barksdale if that view was contradictory with Netscape's recent request to the Department of Justice to investigate Microsoft's Internet marketing tactics.
""In that matter...all we've asked is 'let's stay with the consent decree,'"" Barskdale said, referring to the 1994 consent decree between Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Justice, which set restrictions on Microsoft's behavior.
""We don't believe they are doing that,"" said Barksdale, in an interview with Reuters after the panel. But he declined to speak further on the DOJ's latest request for information from Microsoft, saying that he is having his lawyers do the talking.
Gates was mum on the DOJ during the panel and he shook Barksdale's hand after the session. The two also pointed out that they are working together to develop industry standards for credit card transactions over the Internet, after being on opposing sides of that battle.
""I don't want this to sound like a love-in, but Bill's company and my company work together with Carl's company (Carl Pascarella, president and CEO of Visa U.S.A.) to make (credit card transaction) standards,"" Barksdale said. ""Otherwise we would all be dead.""
But the two CEOs collided on their views of the future. Gates, who is known for being an industry visionary, forecast that within five years many things on the Internet will change and be easier to use, such as the use of URLs (universal resource locators) to find World Wide Wed sites.
""In five years I am quite optimistic that there will be some radical breakthroughs,"" Gates said, adding that users will look at things like URLs and see how silly they were.
Barksdale, however, pointed out that such predictions are impossible to make.
""We have to be honest, despite my learned colleague Mr. Gates's comments,"" Barksdale said. ""It's very hard to predict five years. How many of you would have predicted two and a half years ago that we would have a panel on this topic or that Netscape would be on this panel?"" he asked, pointing out that Netscape did not even exist two and a half years ago.

12,"America Online Inc. signed a hefty marketing pact Tuesday with little-known long-distance provider Tel-Save Holdings Inc., immediately giving the online service a big chunk of cash and Tel-Save access to 8 million America Online subscribers.
The two companies signed a deal to offer America Online members lower-cost long-distance telephone service through Tel-Save, which America Online will promote and sell to its members.
America Online will get an upfront payment of $100 million in cash from Tel-Save, a telecommunications provider based in New Hope, Pa. The online service will also get warrants to buy Tel-Save shares.
The announcement fuelled a rally by Tel-Save stock, which climbed $7.375 to $20.50 on Nasdaq, making it one of the biggest percentage gainers on the exchange.
America Online stock rose $1.125 to $36.625 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts and America Online said the deal was a boost for the world's No. 1 online service because it showed the company was able to put a big value on its growing subscriber base and that it could derive revenues from sources other than subscriber fees.
""This is a proof of promise,"" Bob Pittman, chief executive officer of AOL Networks, said in an interview. ""This is not a deal a (Web) search engine could do because they don't have the assets. We have put a number on it and we have another $100 million in our coffers.""
Pittman said that while Dulles, Va.-based America Online currently has ""plenty of cash"" for its business plan, this is additional cash for general corporate purposes. But America Online must pay the $100 million back.
Analysts said the first $43 million must be paid back over 10 quarters, beginning in its fourth quarter, when America Online begins to market the Tel-Save long-distance service to its members, through pop-up screens which will ask members if they wish to enroll. A sampling will begin this summer.
Tel-Save currently offers long-distance and wireless service to about 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses. Tel-Save said its long-distance service costs less than that from giants like AT&amp;T Corp., MCI Communications Inc. and Sprint Corp.
""These subscribers are the cream of the crop,"" said Dan Borislow, chief executive of Tel-Save. ""This is a great use of our cash."" He declined to estimate how many America Online members may sign up for long-distance service.
America Online's warrants will allow it to buy shares of Tel-Save at prices ranging from $14 to $15.50, for up to 12 million shares, if the total number of America Online members using Tel-Save reaches 3.5 million subscribers. ""They (AOL) could wind up owning over a third of this company,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst.
However, some analysts pointed out that America Online will be competing against the long-distance companies, which spend billions of dollars on marketing.
""This will be the ultimate test of AOL's marketing prowess,"" said David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments.
""It's AOL against 'The Dime Lady,'"" he added, referring to Sprint's popular television commercials featuring actress Candice Bergen.

12,"International Business Machines Corp.'s $23 billion Global Services business will become a separate IBM group, the company announced Wednesday, acknowledging the significance of the fast-growing business.
In a related development, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner reiterated in the company's annual report an earlier statement that it planned to hire ""thousands more"" employees to fuel growth, most of them in Global Services.
IBM told analysts earlier this year it will probably add as many new employees in 1997 as it did in 1996, with a big chunk in Global Services.
In 1996, the Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant's worldwide head count grew to 241,000, up from 225,000 in 1995, mostly due to the expanding services business, an IBM spokesman said. In 1995, employment grew from 220,000 in 1994, the first time employment grew in 10 years.
""I'd like to add here that I am very happy -- and proud -- that our transformation has created job growth,"" Gerstner said in his letter to shareholders, in which he described 1996 overall as ""a solid year.""
When Gerstner first took over the then-struggling computer giant in April 1993, one of his first actions was to take a whopping restructuring charge and cut 25,000 jobs from IBM.
The Global Services unit -- which designs, installs and services computers, including running entire corporate computer systems -- was formerly part of IBM's Sales and Services group.
Sales and Services will be renamed the Sales and Distribution Group, still headed by IBM Senior Vice President Ned Lautenbach.
IBM also said Dennie Welsh, who was general manager of Global Services, will be promoted to a senior vice president and report directly to Gerstner.
Welsh was also named an IBM group executive and will join IBM's executive committee, which makes strategic decisions.
""The time is right for this change,"" Gerstner said in an IBM memo announcing the reorganization. ""He (Welsh) and his colleagues on the services team have done an outstanding job building a great new business for IBM. This change not only reflects a logical adjustment in our organisational structure, but also a recognition of their success.""
IBM's services business has been its fastest growing in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, IBM said services revenues jumped 22 percent to $5 billion. In comparison, IBM's total revenues grew 6 percent in the fourth quarter.
""This is a transformation of the IBM company,"" said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant. ""The major revenue stream is not coming from hardware, it will come from software and services ..."".
""This has some impact on the way IBM sees its future,"" Albert added. ""Anything this important demands direct oversight by Gerstner.""
Wednesday's move follows changes in December when IBM consolidated computer services under the IBM Global Services brand. IBM's services organisation had been operating in some countries outside the United States under different names.
The addition of Global Services now gives IBM five major corporate divisions. The others are the Software Group, the Server Group, which makes the computers that run networks; the Personal Systems Group; and Sales and Distribution.
With Welsh's promotion to IBM senior vice president, the company now has a total of 10 senior vice presidents.
IBM stock fell $1.50 to $137.857 on the New York Stock Exchange.

12,"Sun Microsystems Inc. Tuesday introduced its first network computer, the JavaStation, in a direct challenge to Microsoft and Intel, the dominant players in the industry.
Saying the company was ushering in a new era of computing, Sun Chief Executive Officer Scott McNealy unveiled a sleek, charcoal-grey device, about nine inches by 12 inches, with no disk drives or slots or floppy disks, to allow access to networks of computers and the Internet, at a cost of $742.
Sun, Oracle Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. are challenging the computer industry's dominant ""Wintel"" architecture from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. with the new low-cost, low-maintenance network computers, or ""NCs.""
""Today you'll see why the network is the computer and has been since 1984,"" McNealy said, reiterating Sun's mantra.
The JavaStation is targeted at businesses. Sun said the machines might eventually be offered into the consumer market by cable TV and telecommunications firms as Internet access devices, but it declined to say when that might happen.
With Java, software applications can be written in one language and distributed across networks and diverse computers and computing environments, from mainframes to minicomputers to personal computers and now to the new NCs.
""Java computing is going to be as powerful as the mainframe in the '60s, the minicomputer in the '70s and the PC environment of the '80s,"" said Ed Zander, president of Sun Micro's Computer Co.
Sun introduced three versions of the JavaStation. The lowest cost, $742 version does not include a monitor or a keyboard. The systems are aimed at corporate users of Sun workstations and host computers, but can also access Microsoft PC applications from a host computer running Windows NT.
At a news conference in New York, Sun executives said they did not expect the new machines to take the place of personal computers, but they also professed amazement at the news conference Microsoft held Monday.
Microsoft, with several major players in the PC industry, unveiled its own ""NetPC"" strategy aimed at driving down the cost of PC ownership, with new features in Windows for network management, calling it ""Zero Administration.""
""I have never seen such totally reactive vapour,"" Zander told reporters. ""We must really have touched a nerve.""
McNealy said it was simply a move by the ""old-line legacy Wintel"" trying to hold onto its position in the world. Wintel refers to the combination of Microsoft operating systems and Intel chips.
""People call it a PC on a diet, I call it a PC in a corset, with the strings pulled too tight and a bright red face,"" McNealy said, referring to the Microsoft initiative.
But even with all the hype surrounding the industry's latest infatuation, Sun executives and analysts were not expecting big sales of the NC, nor will the JavaStation become a big percentage of Sun's hardware sales.
""This thing is a small percentage of the total product environment, it will help sell more servers,"" Zander told Reuters.
""Maybe a couple of years from now it will begin competing with low-end PCs,"" said Evan Quinn at International Data Corp., noting Sun's network computing strategy is tied to future expansion of its Java technology.
Sun said the entry level model, containing eight megabytes of memory, will ship beginning in December. A fully configured system, which includes memory, keyboard, a mouse and 14-inch monitor, will cost $995.
The company also said it will offer a JavaStation with 16 megabytes of memory, a mouse, keyboard and a 17-inch monitor for $1,565. The JavaStation also has a small operating system, the Java OS, taking up less than three megabytes of memory.
While the devices are lower cost than the typical PC, which can range in cost from $1,500 to $3,000, Sun executives said their customers will save money as the costs of PC ownership for businesses escalate and are now estimated at anywhere from $6,000 to $12,000 a year, per PC.
Sun said a JavaStation costs about $2,500 a year to maintain, or about $7,500 for three years, potentially saving corporations millions of dollars.

12,"America Online Inc., besieged by complaints by frustrated customers unable to log on and facing the threat of a lawsuit by at least one state, agreed Wednesday to give some members refunds or credit.
The world's largest online service, with 8 million subscribers, agreed in principle to give customers their choice of a free month online or up to $39.90 -- the cost of two months of its unlimited service -- as a result of its recent negotiations with dozens of state attorneys general.
AOL also said it planned to hold its membership at 8 million members for the short term, until it was confident it could meet the needs of its current members.
America Online Chairman Steve Case said the company had been working out a refund offer to its members and that the attorneys general in several states agreed Wednesday afternoon to support its proposed plan to members.
""We felt like today we had to move forward with our programme, with or without an agreement,"" Case said in an interview. ""We were pleased at the final hour that the attorneys general are supporting it... It was a concern that our members were waiting for us to respond. If there hadn't been so many states involved, we could have responded a few days ago.""
Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan held a news conference in Chicago, to announce the preliminary deal with the company and 36 states including Illinois, before AOL's announcement.
Ryan said he expected the Dulles, Va.-based company would formally sign the agreement by Thursday.
""We're comfortable with it. We think it's a good deal for consumers,"" he said.
America Online, which since Dec. 1 has been struggling to deal with an unexpectedly big surge in subscribers, also agreed to halt for a month advertising aimed at attracting new customers.
The proposed settlement headed off, for now, consumer fraud lawsuits threatened by at least one state, New York and under consideration by several other states. Several class action lawsuits have been filed against AOL, and AOL said this agreement has nothing to do with the class action lawsuits.
The agreement calls for customers to receive graduated refunds of up to $39.90 based on how much time they spent over the past two months logged onto AOL, Ryan said.
Any customer can demand a free month's service, no questions asked, but the consumer must request the credit.
""It's a way of saying thank you to our members for their support,"" said an AOL spokeswoman.
Case declined to estimate the cost of the refunds, but New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco told a Manhattan news conference he expected the refunds will cost the company several million dollars in his state alone. There are 600,000 AOL members in New York state.
Wall Street analysts said they did not expect the refunds to have much of a financial impact on AOL, because it will be cutting way back on its quarterly marketing expenses, which average about $120 million to $130 million a quarter.
""Even if you make some pretty aggressive assumptions about how many people will call for refunds, then you have the number who will qualify,"" said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst. ""I come up with $10 to $15 million in terms of cash cost, which will be offset by reduced marketing expenses.""
AOL moved to placate angry customers on Jan. 16, telling them it would spend $350 million to upgrade its network, $100 million more than it had announced in December.
Ryan said the pact originally covered 37 states, but said Missouri's attorney general backed out at the last minute to take a closer look at the proposed refunds.
AOL ran into capacity troubles after it switched its customers from a subscription plan based on the number of hours online to a flat $19.95 monthly rate for unlimited use.
Under the agreement announced Wednesday, AOL agreed to cease all new advertising for the month of February unless already contracted for. Vacco said any ads must include a disclaimer that congestion may prevent customers from getting online.
The prosecutors had complained America Online was continuing to advertise and sign up new customers even as it could not deliver the service to existing users.
AOL also agreed to hire additional operators to field calls from customers seeking to cancel the service, and will set up facilities to accept faxed or online requests to cancel the service. Members had complained they could not cancel.
Customers in the 36 states also could contact the attorney general's office in that state to file a refund request.
Attorneys general or their aides from 20 states met last week in Chicago with the company.
""If there are fresh complaints, we can still file a lawsuit under the consumer fraud laws,"" Ryan said. ""This does not preclude us from acting on behalf of consumers.""

12,"The stock of IBM, which in recent years was derisively dubbed ""I've Been Mugged,"" is back trading at historic highs, with many analysts and traders predicting its shares will continue to soar.
The major rally was sparked last Friday when an influential Wall Street analyst, Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch, raised his 12-month price target on International Business Machines Corp, to $195 from about $155.
Since Friday, IBM's shares have soared 20.2 percent to 153-3/4 at Tuesday's close of market.  
One question now among investors is whether to jump in at these levels like sheep, or wait for IBM's stock to decline.
Market technicians and some analysts who follow IBM say that its once-beleaguered stock still has room to climb.
Even after Friday's run-up, analyst Steve Milunovich of Morgan Stanley on Monday raised his 12-month price target to $170, from $145.
IBM's shares are now trading at levels its shares have not seen since before the 1987 stock market crash, having in fact reached a nine-year high.  
""It still sells at a relatively low valuation, relative to the technology sector,"" Milton said.
Technology stocks typically trade at a price/earnings ratio of about 20 times their earnings estimates. But even with its intraday surge Tuesday of 7-1/4, IBM is still trading at a P/E of only about 14.2 times its trailings earnings estimates.
IBM's shares have climbed nearly 70 percent since July 15, when it was trading around 90-7/8.  
Market technicians, who use charts, graphs and computer analysis without considering company fundamentals, said that IBM's shares have recently broken out of two previous resistance levels on the charts, one at 128 and another at 148, and are now poised for a further uptick.
""At these levels there really isn't much resistance, this can continue to work higher,"" said Susan Stern, a senior technical analyst at Smith Barney. Resistance refers to a price ceiling where a stock price consolidates.  
""I think the primary trend remains up,"" said Gregory Nie, a technical analyst at EVEREN Securities Inc. ""The stock is getting a little extended on a short-term basis.""
Traders seem to agree. One technology trader said he has now covered a short position in IBM. ""I think the move has probably been overdone short-term, but on a valuation, it is a lot cheaper than a lot of tech stocks,"" the trader said. ""The way it's been trading, it's got a little more to go.""
However some more bearish analysts point out that since Mandresh and Milunovich upped their price tagets on IBM's stock price, neither analyst increased earnings estimates.  
Stephen Smith, a PaineWebber analyst, said that he believes some of the fourth quarter 1996 and 1997 earnings estimates on Wall Street for the world's largest computer maker are too high.
""Obviously they have done a good job financially, but it's going to be a lot tougher for them going forward,"" Smith said, adding that he believes IBM has already seen the biggest positive swing in its earnings it will get from its transition to lower-cost mainframe computers based on CMOS technology.
When IBM was in the midst of a huge losses, a management upheaval and restructuring, and its first dividend cuts in 1993, its shares sunk to a low of 43, where it gained the moniker of ""I've Been Mugged"" by many traders on Wall Street.
Now, with a steady stream of profits and many bullish views by analysts, some market analysts are again viewing the stock as a bellwether that is also helping fuel movements in the Dow Jones Industrial average.

12,"The battle between Bill Gates and Larry Ellison over the ballyhooed network computer is getting rougher.
For the past year, Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison has been evangelizing his vision of a low-cost, diskless PC to access corporate networks and the Internet, a PC without a hefty operating system like Windows.
Ellison's vision has captivated many in the industry, who are weary of the domination by the Wintel combination of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating systems and Intel Corp. processors in PCs.
Sun Microsystems Inc. has jumped on the network computer bandwagon with Oracle and on Tuesday it will introduce its much-anticipated JavaStation.
But Monday, in a blatant move to steal Sun's thunder, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates struck back.
Microsoft gathered together a Who's Who list of the PC industry and announced its own low-cost solution to the growing interest in the network computer.
""Obviously, Microsoft is feeling the heat from all the hype that Oracle and Sun are getting,"" said Eileen O'Brien, an analyst at International Data Corp., in Framingham, Mass. Microsoft's initiative left many industry analysts underwhelmed. The software behemoth unveiled a ""new"" PC design, a standard PC design with an Intel processor, memory, a hard disk drive, and of course, the Windows operating systems, with features to automate software upgrades.
But Microsoft zoomed in on the key point of the pro-network computer argument that is striking a nerve with many corporate information technology managers: the high cost of owning large numbers of PCs.
Some industry analysts estimate that a PC, which can range from $1,500 to $3,000 to purchase, can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $12,000 and more annually to maintain.
Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft unveiled ""Zero Administration"" features in its roadmap for its NetPC, which will be built into future versions of its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems.
""That's the biggest advantage of the NC, is the lower cost of ownership"" said Tom Rhinelander, an analyst with Forrester Research, in Cambridge, Mass. ""They are trying to get to that and say, 'we can create something that is just as low-cost.'""
The concept behind the network computer, which ""rents"" software such as a word processing package, or a spreadsheet, from a main computer, or server, is that it does not need continuous upgrades for the operating system or applications.
""PCs have two huge liabilities, high cost and high complexity,"" Marc Andreessen, the co-founder and senior vice president of Netscape Communications Corp., told reporters on a conference call.
As Microsoft was holding a press conference in the backyard of its Silicon Valley foes on Monday, Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape and Oracle, headquartered in Redwood Shores, Calif., unveiled their own alliance.
Oracle agreed to use the Netscape Navigator as the main browser on the Intel version of its network computer, which is expected to ship early next year, and Netscape will offer Oracle database software in its server packages for corporate intranets, or internal networks modeled on the Internet.
""The rise of the NC ... it's a profound shift in the industry,"" Andreessen said.
While Netscape has much to gain with the adoption of devices that access the Internet and corporate networks -- its browser holds about an 80 percent share of the Internet market -- analysts said the current Navigator is a bit too bulky and has limited functionality on a network computer.
Netscape has a subsidiary, called Navio, which is developing a ""thinner"" version of Navigator that will be more tailored to NC-like devices, mostly aimed at the home market.
For now, the hype is surrounding the corporate market, where analysts expect the network computer to have an impact.
""I am skeptical about the NC as a consumer device,"" said Josh Bernoff, another Forrester analyst. ""In corporations, there is a lot more hope for it.""
Even International Business Machines Corp. has jumped into the fray. The world's largest computer maker was the first company to begin shipping its version of a network computer, which it calls the Network Station, to a limited number of customers, last month.
""To us, it's not about network computers replacing PCs, it is the right technology for the right problem,"" said Phil Hester, vice president, network computing, at IBM. ""We have been through three phases of computing, from the mainframe to the minicomputer to the PC and none of them have replaced the ones that came before them.""
Indeed, most market researchers do not believe that the NC will replace the PC, but it will make a dent in the market.
International Data predicts that by the year 2000, there will be about 5.5 million to 6 million NCs shipped, or ""non-PC type devices"" vs. 80 million PCs.
But when asked which companies will dominate the burgeoning NC sector, analysts hedge.
""Who knows who is going to be around that long,"" said International Data's O'Brien.

12,"International Business Machines Corp. and 15 U.S. and Canadian banks announced Monday that they had formed a company to offer a broad range of electronic banking services in North America, the latest in several ventures seeking to jump start banking from home PCs.
The company, the Integrion Financial Network, will offer interactive banking and electronic commerce services to U.S. and Canadian banks beginning early next year.
""With this new venture, electronic commerce will take its biggest step to date,"" IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner told a news conference, in a rare public appearance. ""Integrion is the customer pathway to an array of services ... that no bank could provide alone.""
Integrion will develop an electronic bill payment system and provide software to connect to its network for member banks' customers. Consumers will also be able to access the network via the Internet or any commercial online service.
Electronic commerce, in which consumers buy goods and services via computer, could grow to $600 billion a year within 10 years, Gerstner said. By contrast, electronic commerce now runs at only about $700 million a year, he said.
""The demand is there,"" Barnett Banks Inc. Chief Executive Charles Rice told the news conference.
""There is a very important parallel here,"" said Gerstner, who was once also the president of American Express. ""A group of banks created a product called credit cards... That is exactly what I think will happen here.""
Gerstner said he believed Integrion was providing a system and a platform for a whole new banking service opportunity.
Gerstner said he hoped that companies like Intuit Inc., which has its own set of deals with banks for electronic banking software, would develop versions of its popular Quicken personal financial software for Integrion.
In addition to Barnett, banks teaming up with IBM include BankAmerica Corp., the Royal Bank of Canada, Fleet Financial Group Inc. and Banc One Corp.
Integrion will be owned and operated by the member banks and IBM. It will be open to all banks in North America.
Gerstner said his company would make money from the venture by selling the services of its Global Network and other services. He said Integrion is a for-profit company but that the companies involved will make money through electronic banking services.
Gerstner was not specific on what kind of revenues IBM or any of the companies involved were expecting from the venture.
The companies said they will use the IBM Global Network as the base network for electronic banking, a proprietary network maintained by IBM and used by many corporations as their own network or to conduct commerce with other companies.
Several bankers attending the news conference said the partnership with IBM would lower the cost of developing technology for electronic banking.
The companies said the most sensitive banking transactions will run over the IBM network, which they said is more secure than the Internet, but with connections to the Net.
Gerstner said while the Internet has become a totally new communications medium in the past two years, it is still not yet the ""holy grail"" companies have hoped for.
""The payoff is what these institutions do with this,"" Gerstner said.
Some analysts, however, said if the alliance took too long to get its software out the door, it could run the risk of being overshadowed by recent developments in Internet security, such as the use of longer encryption codes and digital signatures which verify the author of a transaction.
""The marketplace has changed a lot in the past two years,"" said Karen Epper, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""There has been a marked change in the perception of the Internet. The security options that are coming into existence now will make online banking more secure than even private dial-up.""
""The Internet seems best suited for sharing information and not for conducting (business) because of the lack of security,"" Robert Gillespie, chief executive of KeyCorp, one of the bank partners with IBM said. ""We think the reason its grown rather slowly in terms of commerce being conducted is because of the lack of a private secure network to do transactions on.""
Epper pointed out that some banks, such as Wells Fargo Co. and BankAmerica Corp. already offer customers the ability to pay bills and access their accounts, via the banks' Web sites.
Other banks teaming up with IBM are ABN AMRO Bank NV, Comerica Inc., First Bank System Inc., First Chicago NBD Corp., KeyCorp., Mellon Bank Corp., Michigan National Corp., NationsBank Corp., PNC Bank and Washington Mutual Savings Bank.

14,"Microsoft Corp Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown Monday said he expected the company's revenues to rise sequentially in the next two quarters from the $2.3 billion reported for the three months ended September 30.
In an interview, Brown also said he thought the company's cost of goods sold could decline ""a little bit"" in the long term from the 10.9 percent of revenue just reported, already down from 16 percent a year ago.  
""We'll grow a little bit in December and then a little bit more in March, I think,"" Brown said. ""I'm very happy with the general revenue trend, and I was very pleased with the pattern of costs in the quarter.""
Brown said revenue in the December quarter would be driven in part by holiday season cyclicality, while the March quarter would get a boost from the release of the company's Office 97 suite of business applications, an upgrade to one of the software company's core products.  
Brown said cost ratios were falling because of increased use of CD-ROMs for distributing software, rather than more costly diskettes, and because of the growing popularity of enterprise software licenses over sales through the retail and reseller channels.
Brown also said the company's spending on research and development was ""right on target,"" with its announced plans to spend $2.1 billion in the current fiscal year ending June 30.
In addition, he said unearned revenue on the company's balance sheet -- up to $651 million as of September 30 from $560 million three months earlier -- would rise further as a result of growth in the ""subscription"" model of sales, such as licenses and upgrade.

14,"Boeing Co. stock surged Tuesday after the company decided to mothball plans to build a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet.
Boeing shares jumped $6.875 to a record $113.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, accounting for much of the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is one of 30 stocks in the index of blue-chip companies.
Industry analysts estimated the move by the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, announced late on Monday, could reduce Boeing's expenses by more than $2 billion over the next five years and boost annual earnings by as much as $1 a share.
NatWest Securities analyst Nick Heymann said the decision not to proceed with the risky project removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing as it boosts production to meet rising demand and prepares to complete its planned $14 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
""It's fantastic news,"" he said.
While officials at Boeing rival Airbus Industrie said the European consortium would go ahead with plans for an all-new superjumbo jetliner called the A-3XX, Heymann said he thought that project was dead.
""Airbus never really had the resources to go ahead with their aircraft,"" Heymann said.
He said it was even less likely the consortium could raise the funds now that Boeing had talked with the same potential customers and determined market conditions did not justify the investment needed for a new big jet.
Boeing said it would cost more than $7 billion just to develop a new wing and make other changes needed to produce two new versions of the 747 that would add range and capacity.
Analysts noted that the estimated cost of developing the so-called 747-500X and 747-600X had ballooned over the past two years from as little as $3 billion as prospective customers such as British Airways Plc and Singapore Airlines Ltd. demanded more features.
In the end, only Thai Airways International Ltd. and Malaysian Airline System committed to ordering the proposed new jumbo.
Boeing executives said the projected demand for fewer than 500 very large jets over the next 20 years was not enough to generate a sufficient shareholder return.
""Sufficient market demand has not yet developed to justify committing the significant investment required to develop larger versions of the 747,"" Ron Woodard, president of the Boeing commercial airplane group, said in a statement.
While most of the 1,000 Boeing employees working on the 747-X project will be shifted to other planned derivatives, Woodard said Boeing would continue studying the possibility of a jet bigger than the current-generation 747-400.
Airbus, which projects a far bigger market for jets that can seat more than 500 passengers, has said it can develop an all-new jet for $8 billion, but analysts peg the total cost at closer to a whopping $15 billion.
Analysts said Airbus could develop an attractive airliner to alleviate congestion at the world's biggest airports and on heavily travelled routes, but they were sceptical about the consortium's ability to keep costs down.
""At the end of the day it's going to come down to the cost of building the airplane,"" said Byron Callan of Merrill Lynch. ""This only increases the pressure on Airbus to restructure and restructure quickly.""
He and other analysts said Airbus now might be more willing to take the risk needed to launch a new large jet to break Boeing's monopoly on the lucrative top end of the market.
Citing increasing ""route fragmentation,"" especially across the Pacific Ocean, Boeing said it plans to focus its development efforts on new versions of the medium-sized 767 and 777 twin-engine models.
Boeing already has begun offering an increased-capacity version of the 767 that could be launched with an initial order in the next few months.
Boeing also is considering new versions of the 777 that would add both capacity and range.
"
14,"Microsoft Corp. Monday plans to announce a version of its Windows 95 operating system for hand-held consumer devices that will be available this year, according to sources familiar with the company's plans.
The Windows CE system for consumer electronics comes two years after Microsoft scuttled a similar project known as Winpad because its intensive memory requirements would have made the hardware too costly.
Since then the explosive growth of the Internet has expanded the market possibilities for small wireless devices, while Microsoft rival Oracle Corp. has popularised the concept of a $500 consumer device for accessing the Internet.
Microsoft officials declined to comment, but the company said it would have an announcement early Monday on ""a significant addition in the area of Microsoft Windows platform software.""
Microsoft executives previously had disclosed plans to supply a system for hand-held devices in time for the holiday season.
The devices, ranging from a ""smart"" wireless telephone to personal organisers with communcations capabilities, will be marketed by eight computer and consumer electronics companies including Hewlett-Packard Co., Casio Computer Co. Ltd., and Philips Electronics NV, industry analysts said.
The operating system will include stripped-down versions of Microsoft's Word and Excel applications and are likely to have some ability to get information off the Internet's World Wide Web.
But with their tiny, monochrome screens, analysts believe they will be used at first largely for accessing electronic mail and personal information such as telephone numbers and appointments.
""The Web doesn't look good on a 4-inch screen,"" said analyst Mike McGuire of Dataquest. ""What this is about is Internet transactions and communications.""
While hand-held ""personal digital assistants"" such as Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton have been available for several years the products have failed to grow beyond a niche category in part because of the difficulty of swapping information between them and desktop computers, analysts say.
Microsoft aims to break that logjam with its new system, built for RISC microprocessors from Hitachi and others rather than the Intel Corp. processors used for most Windows-based computers.
But at $500 -- or close to $1,000 for a machine fully loaded with communications accessories -- price will continue to be an obstacle, said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group, who said the ""sweet spot"" for small devices was about $300.
""I don't really think the market is going to really jump off in big number until next year,"" he said.
McGuire of Dataquest estimated worldwide shipments of hand-held devices would rise to at least 5 million units a year by the end of the decade from the current 1 million.
While that's still relatively small compared with a personal computer market of about 60 million units annually, Microsoft needs to protect its Windows franchise from any potential incursion, said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.
""If you let someone else get that operating system, over time someone could start working that system upmarket,"" he said. ""Microsoft needs to be a player here.""
Microsoft move into hand-held systems could pose a threat to U.S. Robotics Corp. and Britain's Psion Software Plc, two of the most successful marketers of proprietary hand-held products.
The Windows CE system also could be licensed for use with a rival to Oracle's  Network Computer, analysts said.

Airline Chairman Robert Crandall was scheduled to make a ""major company announcement"" at a news conference Thursday.
Officials of Boeing and American declined to comment on the order, reported in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, although an airline spokesman confirmed that directors of its parent company, AMR Corp., were meeting.
According to the reports, American will announce an order for more than 100 new Boeing jets, including 12 wide-body 777s and 75 narrow-body 737s.
Although American officials have said privately they have chosen Boeing for their fleet modernization program, the exact size of the initial order has not been revealed.
The orders are expected to be contingent on ratification by pilots of a new six-year contract, which could be put to a vote next month. The board of the pilots union was voting Wednesday on a tentative labor pact reached in September.
Industry analysts saw the order as a signal American could order hundreds of Boeing jets over the next two decades as it updates and expands its fleet, now a mix of planes built by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp., Airbus Industrie and Fokker NV.
""I think basically this is a commitment to the Boeing family,"" analyst Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities said.
""If you look at their fleet, they (American) have kind of a hodgepodge of things,"" he said. ""I think you can make the case that most of the airplanes they will be buying in the future will be these Boeing models.""
American currently does not operate the 737, which seats from 108 to 189 passengers and initially will be used to replace the 75 older 727 jets used by the airline.
But analysts said that over the next decade American likely will buy more 737s to replace its fleet of 260 aging McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets.
American already has announced plans to sell most of its wide-body MD-11 jets to Federal Express Corp. for use as cargo jets, and analysts said Boeing's 777 would be a likely replacement choice suitable for the carrier's potential expansion in the Far East.
Analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research said American, the nation's No. 1 airline by revenue, appears to be turning over ""the whole fleet to Boeing aircraft.""
""It's a huge fleet,"" he said. ""Over the next decade there's going to be a lot more than $6 billion in planes delivered.""
For beleaguered McDonnell Douglas Corp., the decision would be yet another blow for a company that has acknowledged it will be only a niche player in the commercial aircraft market and last week was knocked out of contention for the Pentagon's biggest weapons program of the early 21st century, a jet fighter.
Analysts said they still expect a big fleet-renewal order from No. 3 carrier Delta Air Lines Inc., which could go at least partly to McDonnell Douglas.
""Somewhere along the line this is going to bubble over in McDonell Douglas' favor,"" Nisbet said.
Other major U.S. carriers already have announced their intentions to buy new airplanes now that the industry has returned to financial health after a long downturn.
Earlier this month, USAir Group Inc. chose Europe's Airbus Industrie to supply it with narrow-body jets in an order that could be worth $18 billion over the next 13 years. The carrier is negotiating with Boeing and Airbus for new wide-body jets.
Boeing stock rose $2.375 to $96.375 Wednesday and AMR stock was off 62.5 cents at $91, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

14,"An Electronic Arts executive on Wednesday said the company was focusing on personal computers and CD-ROM devices as game platforms despite the success of new cartridge-based machines from Nintendo Co Ltd.
Bing Gordon, executive vice president of marketing for the entertainment software company, said he had been surprised by the success in North America of the Nintendo 64, which was launched last year afer several delays. It became one of the big electronics hits of the holiday season.  
Still, he said Electronic Arts probably would focus on other platforms because of Nintendo's decision to stick with more expensive cartridges rather than switch to CD-ROMs as its rivals Sony Corp and Sega Enterprises Ltd had done.
""We're pretty strongly in the camp that low manufacturing cost in media is important to the overall growth of interactive entertainment,"" Gordon said. ""I doubt we'll ever ship as many products for the Nintendo 64 in any year as we do on the PC or the Sony Playstation.""  
He said Electronic Arts planned to launch its first game for the Nintendo 64, a version of its FIFA soccer product, in March or April to coincide with the European launch of the video game device.
Electronic Arts announced Wednesday it had opened a game development studio in the Seattle area, which Gordon said was destined to become ""one of the top five worldwide centers of interactive entertainment creativity,"" along with Japan, Britain, northern California and possibly Los Angeles.  
He noted that two of the company's four ""long-term competitors"" -- Microsoft Corp and Nintendo -- are located within a few miles of the new Electronic Arts studio, which employs 55 developers. About 40 of them came with last year's acquisition of Manley &amp; Associates Inc in nearby Issaquah, Washington.
Anthony Garcia, a former Microsoft executive who is general manager of the new facility, said he hoped to add about 15 employees during the next year.
Electronic Arts develops software for platforms owned by all its competitors, including Sony and Sega.  
The company also is working to develop online products, including Ultima Online, which will go into a wide-scale beta test in April or May.
Gordon said he hoped the game would be on store shelves in June. He described Ultima Online as a ""persistent world"" that could be experienced by up to 20,000 Internet players in a single day and 2,000 simultaneously.
He said the company would wait until after a market test before deciding whether it would seek to charge for connect time in addition to the software. And he said there were still many issues to be resolved before multiuser Internet games could take off.
""This is not a boat that's about to leave the dock,"" he said.
""The most valuable thing we've done in Internet so far is to start replacing print advertising in our communication mix with Web marketing,"" Gordon said.
He said the company is making money over the Internet by selling its software directly to users.

14,"Teledesic Inc., the communications startup mostly owned by Seattle billionaires Bill Gates and Craig McCaw, Tuesday picked Boeing Co. to build and deploy its planned $9 billion satellite network.
Boeing also will invest up to $100 million in Teledesic, giving it a 10 percent stake in the privately-held company, which plans to launch 288 low-orbiting satellites by 2002 to form an ""Internet in the sky.""
Teledesic Chief Executive Officer David Twyver said the Kirkland, Wash.-based company talked to virtually all the world's major aerospace companies before settling on Seattle neighbour Boeing as prime contractor for the ambitious project.
""But let me say that no one company can do everything that has to be done here,"" Twyver said in an interview.
""We expect that most of the major aerospace and telecommunications companies if they're interested in being part of this will find room in it,"" he said.
The contract is a major victory for Boeing, which is counting on commercial ventures to provide growth for its rapidly expanding defence and space business
Boeing's partly-owned Sea Launch Co. is building a mobile, ocean-based satellite launch platform, and the aerospace giant is expanding its space business aggressively through the recently completed acquisition of Rockwell International Corp. units and the planned purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
""Our relationship with Teledesic is the perfect catalyst for bringing together all of our historical investments in the space business with our recent and planned investments in Sea Launch, Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas,"" Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit said.
Teledesic, initially formed by McCaw, a pioneer in the cellular telephone industry, and Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., has scaled back its initial plans for a network of 840 small satellites more than 400 miles in the air, Twyver said.
Instead, the company now plans to provide the same international coverage with a network of slightly larger satellites orbiting about twice as high above the earth -- still far lower than current communications satellites launched into geosynchronous orbit 22,500 miles up.
Teledesic executives say their network will provide communication comparable to land-based fiber optics, including transmission of voice, data and video, between any two points on Earth equipped with the small dishes needed to link to the low-orbiting satellites.
Other satellite projects in the works, such as Motorola Inc.'s 66-satellite Iridium project, aim to provide voice and data links to mobile users, more like today's cellular telephones.
""We expect our customers to be companies rather than individuals, initially at least,"" Twyver said. ""Almost every company now is putting mission-critical internal applications on Internet-style backbones, and they'll need to get access to every one of their sites.""
Teledesic plans to market the service directly in the United States and is in talks with major telecommunications companies overseas for resale rights.
Twyver said Teledesic is ""very well funded"" now but will be looking for other industrial risk-sharing partners to build out the network.
Boeing likely will build the satellites at a cost of several million dollars each on a mass-production line in its current facilities.
Up to 16 satellites then will be packed onto each rocket for launch over an 18-month period beginning in 2001. Various launch vehicles are expected to be used.
Twyver said the production schedule allows for an 8 percent satellite failure rate, which he said was cheaper than insuring every satellite.
The final configuration will include 12 ""beaded necklaces"" of 24 satellites each orbiting the Earth in different planes, with the option of adding more satellites later.
With the Boeing investment, Gates and McCaw each will own about one-third of Teledesic. AT&amp;T Co.'s AT&amp;T Wireless, which bought McCaw's cellular business, owns about 10 percent of Teledesic, with venture capital investors owning the rest.

14,"A new osteoporosis drug reduces the risk of broken hips by 51 percent among women who already have suffered fractures caused by the debilitating bone disease, researchers said on Tuesday.
In research presented at a medical meeting, Dennis Black of the University of California at San Francisco said results were so promising that the first part of the study was ended early so all the participants could get the drug.
Black said 2,027 women aged 55 to 80 who previously had suffered spinal fractures due to the disease were enrolled in the study, with half of them getting the drug alendronate and half getting a placebo.
Women taking the drug were 51 percent less likely to suffer hip fractures over a three-year period and 55 percent less likely to suffer painful new spinal fractures.
Researchers ended the first phase of the study in October because they felt it would be unethical to continue giving patients the placebo, Black told the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
The second part of the research, studying the effect of the drug on 4,400 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis who had not suffered previous spinal fractures, will be completed early next year, Black said.
Alendronate, sold under the trade name Fosamax by Merck and Co., was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 1995 based on a smaller study that showed it increased bone mass density.
As of July 30 the company had generated $100 million in sales from the drug, a company spokeswoman said.
Merck has its eye on the even more lucrative market for prevention of osteoporosis, which affects an estimated 25 million Americans, the vast majority of them post-menopausal women who suffer bone loss when their bodies stop producing estrogen.
Currently only estrogen-based drugs are approved for prevention of osteoporosis, but Merck filed an application with the FDA in April seeking similar approval for Fosamax, a non-hormonal drug.
Researchers at the meeting were to present evidence on Wednesday that Fosamax stops bone loss and restores bone mass at the spine and hip.
Black noted that hip fractures are among the most debilitating symptoms of osteoporosis, leading to permanent disability in 50 percent of the cases and costing the U.S. economy $5.4 billion annually.
He said the research showed that ""even women with advanced osteoporosis can benefit from treatment.""
Another researcher at the conference presented a study showing that a class of drugs known as cytokine inhibitors prevents bone loss in laboratory rats, indicating a possible new treatment for osteoporosis.

14,"Boeing Co. said Tuesday it formed an entrepreneurial organisation that will seek out joint ventures and possibly acquisitions related to its core business of commercial airplanes.
Boeing senior vice president of planning and international development Lawrence Clarkson will serve as president of the new organisation, Boeing Enterprises, which will be part of Boeing's commercial airplane group.
In an interview, Clarkson said the unit was aggressively seeking out ""very significant"" projects and could grow rapidly in the next year.
Clarkson declined to be specific about ongoing negotiations but indicated they probably would not involve new airplane models.
Instead, he said Boeing would seek out opportunities in ""businesses that are very related to what Boeing does, but which up to now we've let other people do.""
For example, Boeing executives in the past have discussed taking advantage of the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records, a business Clarkson said would fall within the new unit.
Boeing Enterprises also will be responsible for the company's joint venture with General Electric Co. to market the 737 as a business jet.
Clarkson said formation of the unit had been discussed for some time and was unrelated to Boeing's planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
""The idea is to have a basically independent operation so we don't get tied down with the existing bureaucracy,"" he said.
He said some of the prospective joint ventures could have ""significant"" international components, particularly focusing on the Asia-Pacific region.
Boeing is continuing to study the possibility of working with Asian manufacturers to build a new small jet that would seat about 100 passengers, but Clarkson said he did not expect any decisions in the near future.
Clarkson said he expected any acquisitions would be profitable immediately.
""The basic objective here is to increase shareholder value and grow the company, so obviously we want it to be as profitable as possible,"" he said.
A decision on Clarkson's replacement in planning and international development will be made in the near future, the company spokeswoman said.
Clarkson, 58, came to Boeing in 1987 from engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.
After serving as a senior vice president in the commercial airplane group, Clarkson was promoted to his position in Boeing headquarters, which The New York Times descibed as ""the closest thing it has to a corporate secretary of state.""
""I think I'll still have to use some of those skills, but it's kind of nice to get into more of a line operation and something new,"" Clarkson said.
Clarkson will retain his title as one of only six Boeing senior vice presidents.

14,"Japan will likely become the largest international supplier of structural parts for the planned next-generation Boeing 747 jumbo jet, Boeing Co. said on Thursday.
Boeing officials said the Seattle-based company was holding talks with three major Japanese aerospace manufacturers -- Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. -- aimed at significantly expanding Japanese manufacturers' role in producing two ""stretch"" versions of the 747.
""The discussions will go on until later in the year, but it is likely the Japanese industry will end up being the largest international supplier of parts for the 747-500x and -600x,"" Boeing spokeswoman Susan Davis said.
While the three manufacturers provide structural parts for most Boeing models, they were not among top 10 suppliers for the current-generation 747 jet, another Boeing official said.
The 747-500x would hold 462 passengers in a typical three-class configuration and have a range of 10,000 miles, compared with 416 passengers and 8,400 miles for the 747-400. The 600x would hold 548 passengers and have an 8,900-mile range.
The three Japanese companies were already significant Boeing partners, building about 20 percent of the structural parts for the new 777 as well as wing components and other parts for the current 747 jumbo.
The Japanese manufacturers would likely produce 747 wing flight-control surfaces and landing-gear doors as well as fairings that join the wings to the body.
Outside suppliers now provide these components for the current 747 model with the exception of the fairings, which are made at Boeing's plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the site of a recent five-week strike.
Last week Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit told a group gathered to mark a century of trade between Seattle and Japan that Japan Airlines Co. Ltd. was the company's biggest 747 customer, having taken delivery of 96 jets since 1970.
""We strongly believe that strengthening of ties between our two countries remains crucial for the future,"" he said.
Boeing hopes to land more orders from Japanese airlines by increasing ties with Japanese manufacturers, although Davis said there was ""no guarantee.""
""They provide high-quality parts at competitive prices,"" she said. ""If it does happen to increase sales, it increases the work here in the U.S. too.""

14,"Microsoft Corp.'s fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $1.04 billion, well beyond analysts' expectations, on strength in its core business, including sales of its Office 97 upgrade, the world's largest software company reported Thursday.
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated that he expects results in the current fourth quarter to be similar to the quarter ended March 31, which he termed ""sizzling.""
But in an interview Brown also said he expects Microsoft's growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons with year-earlier quarters and a lack of planned major new upgrades.
Net income, equal to 79 cents a share, rose from earnings of $562 million a year ago, or 44 cents a share, in the third quarter. The number easily topped Wall Street's consensus analyst forecast of 64 cents a share, according to First Call.
Revenues totalled $3.21 billion, a 45 percent increase over the $2.21 billion racked up in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average had predicted revenues of about $2.9 billion.
Microsoft released its latest results after financial markets closed. In after-hours trading, the Redmond, Wash.-based company's stock jumped $4.625 to $102.75 from its Nasdaq closing price, dealers said.
""Worldwide acceptance of Microsoft Office 97 ignited these outstanding results,"" Brown said in a statement.
Office 97, the latest upgrade of the company's best-selling software package, was launched in January. It combines ""productivity applications"" such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $2 billion of the company's $8.7 billion in the prior fiscal year.
Brown said Microsoft also realised ""solid gains"" from sales of operating systems.
Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from ""platforms,"" including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers, which generate about one-third of the company's revenues.
""However,"" Brown cautioned, ""incredible results like these are seldom duplicated, and we are mindful of the very tough comparisons we will have in fiscal 1998.""
Brown said in the interview that the first quarter of fiscal 1998 could show a downturn from the fourth fiscal quarter of 1997. He said he expected results to rise sequentially after that.
Brown said he expected a spike in revenues from the Office 97 upgrade would begin to tail off in the current quarter, although deferred revenues from product shipped earlier would prevent a sequential downturn.
The next upgrade of Office will not be out until fiscal 1999, Brown said.
""So, fiscal '98 is in the product cycle valley from a comparison standpoint, and that makes the comparison tough, even if business fundamentals are very good,"" he said.
Brown said he expected the revenue surge from the Windows 95 operating system to begin to tail off soon now that the product has been out 20 months.
Brown said he was ""very excited"" about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an ""all-time Olympic record.""
""We haven't had very many quarters in which EPS (earnings pr share) went up 80 percent,"" he said. ""That's not a quarter-in, quarter-out type of thing. This is just an incredible quarter.""
"
45,"China issued a spirited defence of embattled U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday, accusing the United States of trying to use financial blackmail to stop him from serving a second term.
Boutros-Ghali had helped push forward world development during his five-year term as U.N. chief and his re-election should have been assured, said the People's Daily newspaper, official mouthpiece of China's communist leadership.
The United States should reconsider its lonely stance as the only nation on the U.N.'s 15-member Security Council to oppose the Egyptian's re-election, the newspaper said.
Washington on Tuesday vetoed Boutros-Ghali's candidacy, accusing him of being too slow in pushing U.N. reform and saying his candidacy would further delay U.S. payment of $1.4 billion in membership dues owed to the world body.
""Lumping together Boutros-Ghali's reappointment and the payment of membership dues can only make people feel that someone is trying to blackmail the United Nations,"" People's Daily said in a signed editorial.
All U.N. members, whatever their internal politics, were responsible for paying dues and U.S. opposition to Boutros-Ghali was unjustified, it said in the latest of a series of Chinese affirmations of support for the U.N. chief.
""The United States has absolutely not raised any decent grounds for opposing Boutros-Ghali's renewal, but has just criticised him for being weak on U.N. reform,"" it said.
""You just have to respect facts to be able to see that this kind of criticism of inadequacy is not persuasive.""
Boutros-Ghali's opposition to U.S. attempts to use the United Nations as a cover for policies of hegemony and power politics was a key factor behind Washington's opposition to his re-election, said the Yangcheng Daily newspaper.
The U.S. Republican-dominated Congress is delaying payment of the $1.4 billion U.S. debt to the United Nations, a policy helping to bankrupt the cash-strapped world body.
People's Daily said Boutros-Ghali had worked to push U.N. reform, had paid great attention to the cause of world development and had made a special contribution to development in Africa during his tenure, which ends on December 31.
Diplomats say African nations are currently driving the campaign for Boutros-Ghali's re-election, aiming to keep his candidacy alive as long as possible in the hope of a compromise solution or a change in the U.S. stance.
Boutros-Ghali said on Thursday that he did not wish to see his name submitted to the Security Council for another vote but also that he was not withdrawing from the race.
Washington's reluctance to propose alternatives to Boutros-Ghali was a sign of U.S. insecurity and its knowledge that any candidate it chose would be rejected by other nations, the People's Daily said.
""If the African nations continue to support Boutros-Ghali, the United States will face a difficult decision,"" it said.
""Many people hope the United States that cast the opposing vote will consider its position anew and solve this problem in an appropriate way.

45,"Tsingtao Brewery built its reputation as China's king of beers earlier this century by catering to thirsty foreign invaders.
But analysts warn that after years at the top, a complacent Tsingtao today is seeing a new breed of invader -- this time in the form of nimble foreign beer makers -- eat into its once-impregnable market share.
The brewery in eastern China's Shandong province, which in 1993 became the first Chinese company to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange has ""rested on their laurels for too long"", said one Beijing-based beer industry analyst.
While Tsingtao has begun to respond to the threat from foreign-funded joint ventures and upstart domestic brewing groups, it still relies too much on its traditional brand-name prestige and is being out-advertised by thirstier rivals, he said.
Company officials at the brewery's home in the scenic port city of Qingdao -- formerly Romanised as Tsingtao -- say they feel the pressure but are ready to fight back.
""We don't feel there is a crisis,"" said general manager Peng Zuoyi, the head of a new management team appointed earlier this year to boost the brewery's prospects.
Tsingtao plans to boost production to 500,000 tonnes this year, from 350,000 tonnes in 1995, and hike annual output to 1.4 million tonnes by 2000, Peng told reporters at the brewery.
LIFE CAN BE HARDER IN A MARKET ECONOMY
Under communist China's old command economy, Tsingtao was a luxury commodity in chronically short supply. But Peng said the market economy and the arrival of foreign brands were taking their toll.
""Before the foreigners came to China, almost all the high-class restaurants and hotels had our Tsingtao Beer,"" Peng said. ""In the market where we were once 100 percent, we now account for perhaps 70-80 percent.""
Against the glamour of foreign beers, Tsingtao touts its unique heritage as the premier domestic beer in one of the world's fastest-growing markets.
The company was founded in 1903 and initially targeted thirsty Germans living in the port city that Germany had wrested from a weak China.
Company officials say the beer also thrived during the Japanese occupation before and during World War Two.
The decades of state control that followed the communist revolution of 1949 were a factor behind Tsingtao's later neglect of its home market, said Elizabeth Cheng, head of China research at HSBC James Capel in Hong Kong.
""Now with the new management, hopefully they will be able to do something more dynamic,"" Cheng said.
A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY
Growing competition is not the only worry cited by analysts, who have long complained about a lack of transparency at the brewery, which is still 44 percent state-owned.
In 1994, the brewery drew investor ire when it was found to have lent out the foreign currency proceeds of its share flotations at high interest rates instead of investing them in its core business as promised.
Peng said that problem was mainly a misunderstanding.
""In some ways Chinese methods are not quite the same as international ones,"" Peng said, adding that lack of a clear investment plan had caused Tsingtao to put its money elsewhere.
The 4,000-strong workforce of the group, which has assets of 3.0 billion yuan ($360 million), is another potential concern.
""They are vastly overstaffed,"" said the Beijing-based analyst, a view seemingly borne out by the relaxed approach of many workers observed during a recent visit to the brewery.
Tsingtao says it still has up to 2.4 percent of the Chinese beer market, although the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said last month that the share was now likely below 2.0 percent.
While life as a listed company would never be as easy as it was under the command economy, the analysts said Tsingtao was too much of a national symbol to be allowed to fail.
Tsingtao is also one of 10 domestic brewing groups that have been promised preferential loans and conditions from the government to help them compete with joint venture breweries.
""(Tsingtao is) troubled, but they will survive,"" said the Beijing-based analyst. ""They have very powerful backing... a lot of people do not want to see it go down the tubes.""
"
45,"Beijing's rare use of United Nations clout to stall the Guatemalan peace process was a clear signal of China's determination to punish rival Taiwan's small band of diplomatic allies, analysts said on Sunday.
""Beijing simply will not let anyone forget the price they will pay for supporting Taiwan,"" said one Asian diplomat.
""They (China) clearly want to make sure Taiwan's allies learn a lesson, and if they break ties with Taipei, all the better.""
Beijing prefers to take a low-key approach to diplomacy at the United Nations, where it sees itself as a champion for developing nations, preferring abstentions to vetos on issues where it disagrees with the Security Council majority.
But to a leadership that has staked much of its credibility on its nationalist credentials, Taiwan is an issue so visceral that its usual diplomatic norms no longer apply.
The diplomatic anger that prompted China on Friday to veto a U.N. mission of 155 unarmed peacekeepers to disarm Guatemalan rebels was the product of Beijing's 48-year rivalry with the Nationalist-ruled island.
China has long worked to isolate Taiwan, which it has considered a renegade province since it became home to the defeated Nationalists at the end of a civil war in 1949.
Beijing sees diplomatic support for the island as backing for the splitting of China, or for Taiwanese independence.
The People's Daily, mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party, said Guatemala's warm ties with Taiwan left Beijing no choice but to exercise its U.N. veto to defend the motherland.
Guatemala had damaged China's territorial integrity, interfered in Beijing's internal affairs and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, the newspaper quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang as saying.
""We had no choice but to vote against the draft decision on peacekeeping,"" Shen said, adding that it was up to the Central American nation to resolve the situation.
""Let he who tied the bell on the tiger take it off,"" he said.
China has made clear it has no particular objection to the dispatch of a peace-keeping mission to Guatemala for three months to implement a U.N.-brokered accord agreed last month by the government and leftist rebels.
Guatemala's Taiwan ties alone were behind Beijing's decision to kill the mission, which was aimed at putting a final end to more than 36 years of war in which more than 100,000 people were killed and a further 40,000 ""disappeared"".
The Friday night vote left Beijing isolated 14-1 in the Security Council -- an ironic result coming just weeks after state media crowed over U.S. diplomatic isolation following Washington's use of its veto in a vote on U.N. leadership.
While China has long been considered a slumbering dragon at the United Nations, no issue is as likely to rouse the nation from its diplomatic quiet as Taiwan.
China has vowed to invade the island if it ever declares independence and has made non-recognition of the Taipei government the centrepiece of its international strategy.
The veto of the Guatemalan peace mission drew predictable fire in Taiwan, where the ruling Nationalist Party has long denied any dream of formal succession but says China must develop democracy before reunification can be considered.
""If Beijing pushes hard on Taiwan again and again, it will only push Taiwanese people farther away (from reunification),"" the China Times newspaper said in its Sunday editorial.
""The United Nations will become the main site (for Beijing) to suppress Taipei's diplomacy,"" said the United Daily News. ""The diplomatic war between the two sides is heating up.""
"
45,"China on Tuesday slammed Washington for pursuing a policy of ""human rights diplomacy"" that was sabotaging Sino-U.S. ties and cultivating mistrust.
The China Daily newspaper said there were currently no prospects of a breakthrough in long-running disputes over China's human rights record that were hampering relations.
""U.S. human rights diplomacy is sabotaging the foundation of normal cooperation between the two countries and is cultivating mistrust,"" the English-language newspaper said in a signed commentary.
""Such U.S. human rights diplomacy has impeded Sino-U.S. ties.""
It said sensationalised human rights issues such as reports of repression in Tibet, the abuse of orphans and sales of organs from condemned prisoners had been used by Washington, which was following a policy of ""containment"" against Beijing.
""Out of self interest, the United States began to exploit human rights issues and contain China,"" it said. ""To defile China, the United States has not stopped publicly attacking China's human rights record.""
Washington rejects any suggestion it is pursuing a policy of containment of China, saying economic and political engagement with Beijing is the best way to push for protection of human rights.
Sino-U.S. differences over Beijing's treatment of political detainees and separatists in its restive Tibetan and northwestern Xinjiang regions have been overshadowed this year by disputes over trade, copyright piracy and Taiwan.
In June, the two sides narrowly averted a multi-billion dollar trade war over intellectual property theft in China.
Chinese missile tests off the coast of Beijing's arch-rival Taiwan in March prompted Washington to send two aircraft carrier battle groups to monitor the region.
Alleged sales of Chinese nuclear technology to Pakistan and Beijing's big trade surplus with the United States have also strained ties.
Both sides hailed a July visit to Beijing by U.S. national security adviser Anthony Lake as having warmed relations and increased mutual trust, but analysts say ties between the two Pacific powers are unlikely to remain smooth for long.
This year's U.S. presidential election would probably make the White House's policies toward China more ambiguous, the China Daily said.
""Sino-U.S. relations will likely be characterised by conjecture and sounding each other out -- encouraging distrust,"" it said.

45,"A Beijing court on Wednesday sentenced dissident and former student leader Wang Dan to 11 years in prison, the latest hammer-blow struck by China against its tiny band of pro-democracy activists.
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours to convict Wang of plotting to subvert the government, but the young dissident's family quickly denounced the verdict and vowed to appeal.
""We are angry... He received such a heavy sentence even though he was innocent,"" Wang's father, Wang Xianzeng, said in a telephone interview after a brief meeting with his son at a Beijing detention centre.
""Wang Dan said he wants to appeal,"" he said. ""Wang Dan feels everything that he has done has been above-board... it was all for China's democratisation.""
Wang, 27, was sentenced to 11 years in prison and deprived of his political rights for a further two years, the Xinhua news agency said in a long report hailing the fairness of the trial.
""Sufficient evidence, which includes written materials, witness accounts, recorded tape and criminal technical appraisal, were shown at the court,"" the official agency quoted the trial's chief judge as saying.
""The evidence is conclusive,"" it quoted the verdict as saying. ""(Wang) instigated people by saying that 'It is time we turn our words into actions'.""
Wang, who vanished into detention in May 1995, had faced a maximum penalty of death and a minimum 10-year prison term.
One of the student leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing that were crushed by the army, Wang had been one of the few members of China's dwindling band of dissidents not in exile or serving a long term in detention or prison.
A spate of arrests and detentions in recent months has left the pro-democracy movement reeling, analysts say.
Wang's conviction was a slap in the face for Western governments that have appealed to Beijing to improve its human rights record, diplomats in the Chinese capital said.
New York-based rights group Human Rights in China denounced the verdict as the result of a show trial that blatantly violated Chinese law and international standards.
Scores of police enforced tight security around the court building in western Beijing, keeping foreign journalists well away from a trial billed by officials as open to the public.
Less than 20 observers had been allowed in the court, said Wang's father, who was allowed to attend along with the dissident's older sister.
""Not one witness was summoned,"" he said. ""The judge did not uphold the justice and dignity of the law... How can writing articles constitute a crime?""
The family would have 10 days to appeal upon receiving official notification of the verdict in about five days' time, he said, adding they were not optimistic the verdict would be overturned.
The 11-year sentence had been no surprise to the family or to Wang, who had been in good spirits during their 30-minute meeting after the trial, said his mother, a 61-year-old museum researcher who attended as one of two defence lawyers.
Wang, who once promoted free debate in the campus of the elite Beijing University, has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
He returned to political activism after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to Beijing's communist leadership for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
Wang's father said his son's health had deteriorated during more than 15 months in detention, but added the former student activist believed he had done nothing to be ashamed of.
""He has a clear conscience,"" he said.

45,"China's troubled relations with the United States should improve in 1997, but disputes over Taiwan, trade and the return of Hong Kong to Beijing rule could easily sour ties, state media and analysts said on Thursday.
After lurching from crisis to crisis throughout much of 1995 and 1996, Beijing and Washington were both keen to develop new stability in the cross-Pacific relationship by toning down differences, said a Beijing-based Western diplomat.
""There will still be problems... but if things follow their present trajectory, I would say you won't have quite such big ups and downs as over the last couple of years,"" he said.
The November meeting in Manila between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton and the prospect of mutual state visits had presaged a possible period of Sino-U.S. warming, said the official Guangming Daily.
""But because a number of serious differences still exist, this road to the recovery and improvement of relations will again not be smooth,"" it said in a commentary.
U.S. policy towards Beijing's island rival Taiwan, the return of the British colony Hong Kong and China's long-delayed entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would be crucial issues, it said.
Chinese concerns were rising over Hong Kong, which will revert to Beijing's rule at midnight on June 30 after more than 150 years as a British colony, the Western diplomat said.
Beijing leaders were aware that any sign of a harsh approach to democratic opponents of their Hong Kong policies would cause a storm of protest in a U.S. Congress already suspicious of Chinese intentions, he said.
""They are starting to get very worried, because they realise the Americans are going to focus on Hong Kong and it is going to give Congress another stick to beat them with,"" he said. ""It's pretty certain there's going to be a bit of friction involved.""
A Chinese analyst on Sino-U.S. economic relations said Hong Kong's return could add fuel to disputes over China's swelling trade surplus with the United States by combining the former colony's exports with those of the mainland.
""After Hong Kong's return, there will be some clashes over this matter,"" said the analyst, who declined to be identified.
Taiwan continued to be a key stumbling block, he said.
Sino-U.S. relations plunged in March 1996, when China -- angry at attempts by Taiwan to break out of diplomatic isolation -- carried out missile tests and war games in the Taiwan Strait before the island's first direct presidential elections.
Washington responded by sending two aircraft carrier battlegroups to the area, an action that infuriated Beijing.
The United States appeared to have adjusted its approach to the Taiwan issue in recent months, urging Taipei to tone down its campaign for international recognition, the diplomat said.
The Guangming Daily said Washington was still not taking enough account of China's real situation in talks on its WTO entry, which Beijing says has been stalled by U.S. objections.
""The (WTO) entrance fee is too high,"" echoed the Chinese analyst, adding that China's automobile and pharmaceutical industries would suffer if forced to face foreign competition.
If Beijing and Washington continued to try to limit the impact of such disputes on overall ties, 1997 could bring needed stability to the Sino-U.S. relationship -- plus a possible exchange of presidential visits, analysts said.
""Hong Kong is the key, if something doesn't go wrong with Hong Kong I would say this will be a much better year than 1996, and probably than 1995 as well,"" the diplomat said. ""They've been pretty bad years.""
"
45,"U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to visit China in late February in a trip aimed at further improving ties that have warmed rapidly in recent months, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
""China places great importance on this visit,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.
Albright would hold talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and a wide range of issues was expected to be discussed, Shen said.
Albright's first visit as Secretary of State comes at a time when relations between China and the United States are warming swiftly, with U.S. Vice President Al Gore reported to be preparing to visit Beijing in late March.
U.S. President Bill Clinton met China's President Jiang Zemin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila last November and the two agreed on an exchange of presidential visits, the first since early 1989.
""A major topic of the meeting of the two foreign ministers will be how to push forward relations on the basis of the presidential meeting,"" Shen said of Albright's visit.
Former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to China last November on a fence-mending visit that both sides hailed as a major step in repairing ties ravaged by disputes for well over a year.
The announcement of Albright's China trip coincides with a flurry of visits by U.S. officials to Beijing.
A U.S. human rights team led by Sandra Kristoff, the National Security Council's chief Asia expert, and including Peter Eicher, director of the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, was to conclude two days of talks in Beijing on Thursday.
The U.S. team was in China on the eve of the release of Washington's annual worldwide human rights report that once again slams Beijing's record.
This year's report says that by the end of 1996 there were almost no active dissidents left in China who had not been jailed or exiled.
Officials said the team would seek concessions from Beijing on human rights that could make it unnecessary this year for Washington to co-sponsor a United Nations resolution critical of China's policy.
Albright has vowed to confront Beijing on its human rights record, trade issues and weapon sales abroad -- all thorns in Sino-U.S. ties -- but says relations between the two Pacific giants cannot be held hostage to any one issue.
China on Wednesday told Clinton not to worry about Chinese human rights and Hong Kong's future freedoms, saying Beijing's rights record spoke for itself and liberty in the British colony was assured.
Clinton said on Tuesday that Washington had made less progress than hoped in influencing Chinese rights policies and warned that Hong Kong's value to China might fall if liberties in the colony were lost after it returns to Beijing rule.
Senior U.S. trade official Lee Sands began talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of cross-Pacific friction.
Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry.
Top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes was also in Beijing for talks to hammer out a new textile accord with negotiations seen extending right up to a Friday deadline for agreement.

45,"China's top prosecutors have vowed to crack down on corruption among the ranks of leading officials in the government and ruling Communist Party, state media said on Tuesday.
The call for tougher action to curb growing official graft came as senior leaders considered whether to punish scandal-hit former Beijing Party boss Chen Xitong for dereliction of duty.
In the first 11 months of 1996, Chinese procurators had begun action in 77,611 cases of corruption, bribery and economic crime and had dealt with 33,879 cases, up 9.4 percent compared with the same period of 1995, the China News Service said.
""China's legal organs will make more efforts to deal with major embezzlement and bribery cases involving officials next year,"" the official Xinhua news agency quoted Deputy Procurator General Liang Guoqing as telling a conference in Beijing.
Prosecutors would focus on major corruption cases involving leading officials in the ruling Communist Party, government and law enforcement agencies, Liang said.
The number of graft cases involving more than 10,000 yuan ($1,200) was growing fast, said the China News Service.
On Monday, a top Beijing official said China's party leadership was considering whether to have disgraced capital party boss Chen Xitong charged for dereliction of duty.
""Viewing the situation from the case of Wang Baosen, he (Chen) can't escape dereliction of duty,"" Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa told reporters in a reference to a former Beijing vice-mayor who committed suicide last year after coming under investigation for corruption.
Investigators had uncovered no evidence to show that Chen, one of China's most influential men until he fell from power in the corruption scandal, was guilty of more serious wrongdoing.
Beijing has repeatedly launched crackdowns on graft, which senior leaders have called a cancer that threatens the Communist Party's grip on power, but many Chinese say enforcement of anti-corruption measures at senior levels is patchy at best.
""Procuratorial agencies at all levels should at all times make dealing with major cases, especially those involving crimes by leading officials, the key point in pushing the deepening of the war on corruption,"" the Xinhua Daily Telegraph said.
Anti-graft vigilance would be essential in 1997, a key year for China's economic reforms, it quoted procurator Liang as telling the five-day conference of prosecutors in the capital.
Construction officials have said that as much as 10 percent of the cost of new buildings can disappear into the pockets of contractors. Pharmaceutical salesmen say many doctors are only willing to prescribe drugs if they are paid to do so.
Public perceptions of endemic graft have pushed Beijing to seek new ways to stiffen flagging moral and fiscal rectitude among officials, who have seen their formal salaries trail far behind the incomes of entrepreneurs and private sector workers.
From January 1 next year the Ministry of Public Security would for the first time begin requiring China's police to swear an oath of loyalty, discipline and honesty, Xinhua said.
""This... is a way of getting police to show respect for the responsibility they bear,"" the agency said.
The oath would include pledges of loyalty first to the Communist Party, then to the people and the law.
Officers would also vow to be honest.
"
45,"The child chosen by China to be Tibet's second holiest monk passed the first anniversary of his selection quietly in Beijing on Friday, far from the restive Himalayan region, officals in the capital said.
Officials in Tibet said they had concluded a six-month push to curb separatist sentiment in the deeply Buddhist region's monasteries, a campaign that an overseas watchdog group has reported led to the expulsion or detention of scores of monks.
Seven-year-old Gyaincain Norbu, chosen by China as the 11th incarnation of the Panchan Lama, would not attend any activities on the first anniversary of his selection, an official of the Tibet regional authority's Beijing office said.
""The child is in Beijing, so there will not be any activities in Tibet,"" the official said by telephone.
All planned anniversary celebrations slated for the capital had been completed, he said.
State media have said that Norbu, regarded by many Tibetans as a pretender to the 10th Panchen Lama's spiritual mantle, visited Beijing's Yonghe Lamasery last week to celebrate the anniversary of his enthronement.
Tibet's spiritual leader, the exiled Dalai Lama, has named another boy as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, the Himalayan region's second holiest monk who died in 1989.
Chinese sources have said Beijing's choice lives in the capital under state protection against possible assassination attempts by radical Tibetans.
In Tibet, an official of the religious affairs bureau said a six-month campaign to boost patriotism and curb separatist sentiment in the region's monasteries had been concluded.
The London-based human rights watchdog Tibet Information Network (TIN) said this week that official attempts to bring restive clergy to heel had led to at least 150 monks being expelled from their monasteries and possibly 20 arrests.
TIN said many monks had been told to leave because they refused to criticise the Dalai Lama, Beijing's greatest rival for the loyalties of the remote region's people.
Some monks had been sent back to civilian life because they did not behave properly during the patriotism campaign, the religious affairs official said but gave no details.
He dismissed a report from TIN that the campaign left only 300 monks at Ganden monastery near the Tibetan capital.
""Ganden has more than 490 monks...they are all at the monastery,"" he said, but declined to comment on whether there was an official limit on the number of clergy allowed there.
""That is a secret, we cannot talk about it on the telephone,"" he said.
While Beijing says most Tibetans back Chinese rule, a constant propaganda barrage against supporters of the Dalai Lama, exiled since an abortive uprising against Beijing rule in 1959, is testament to his remaining influence.
An edition of the Tibet Daily newspaper seen in Beijing on Friday quoted senior officials as saying all public figures should clearly state their position in the war on separatism.
""Some of our comrades do not sufficiently recognise the Dalai Lama clique's ideological infiltration and do not combat it strongly enough,"" the newspaper said.
"
45,"China on Thursday ordered two 747 airliners from U.S. aviation giant Boeing Co in a multimillion dollar deal that Washington's ambassador to China said was hastened by upcoming visits by U.S. congressmen.
The two jets would be powered by engines from Pratt and Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp, and would be delivered in 1999 to Air China, Beijing's international carrier, officials of the China Aviation Supplies Corp said.
Closure of the $383 million contract, which follows the purchase of three 747-400s by Air China in July last year, had been hastened by imminent visits to Beijing of about 35 U.S. congressmen, said U.S. ambassador James Sasser.
""This Boeing contract is something that has been under discussion for some time,"" Sasser told reporters. ""Clearly there was an effort to try to finalise this transaction on the eve of the visit of a number of senators and congressmen.""
One official bipartisan delegation of around 22 U.S. congressmen is scheduled to arrive in Beijing next week for talks with Chinese officials that are expected to include touchy issues such as the Sino-U.S. trade balance and human rights.
Relations between Washington and Beijing have long been battered by disputes over trade, Taiwan, copyright piracy and China's human rights record, but both sides say ties warmed in the latter half of 1996.
Chinese efforts to ease Beijing's swelling and highly sensitive trade surplus with the United States were likely to provide a boost to U.S. exports to China, Sasser said.
""I think you will see over the coming months an effort on the part of the Chinese to make additional purchases of U.S. goods, in an effort to try to even up as much as possible the present trade deficit with the United States,"" he said.
The United States says it has a trade deficit with China, reaching nearly $29 billion in the first nine months of last year. Beijing insists that its customs figures show a surplus in favour of the United States.
The ambassador declined to give details of the deals likely to be agreed or to say which sectors might benefit most.
Some U.S. businessmen say high-profile sales are among the earliest casualties of Sino-U.S. diplomatic spats, and Boeing has in the past hinted that it has lost deals to European archrival Airbus Industrie for political reasons.
Boeing officials at the Thursday signing declined to comment on whether the 747 contract had been hastened by the recent thawing in cross-Pacific ties, but Regional Director for Aircraft Contracts Arthur Abel said the deal was heartening.
""We are just very encouraged and optimistic about our long term relationship with China,"" Abel told Reuters.
A Boeing statement said the two 286-passenger 747 Combis it would supply to Air China marked a strong vote of confidence in the U.S. planemaker from an airline that already operated 45 of its aircraft.
Officials of the state-run China Air Supplies Corp also welcomed the deal, although they identified the ordered aircraft as 301-seat 747-400s.

44,"Canadian consumers are set to play Scrooge again this holiday season to the despair of long-suffering Canadian retailers, according to a survey of consumers by accounting firm Arthur Andersen.
""Overall, the holiday season will not be too much different from last year,"" said Anderson partner Frank Anderson, who heads the firm's consumer products division.
In 1995, Canadian retailers posted one of their worst holiday seasons in recent years, followed by an unseasonably cool spring that hurt sales and forced chains to discount their stock.
Many chains have said they are counting on the holidays to boost results in 1996.
In the survey released this week, 58 percent of respondents said they would spend the same amount as last year, while 28 percent forecast lower spending and 14 percent said they would spend more.
The survey by Arthur Andersen and Quebec firm Le Groupe Mallette Maheu polled 1,220 Canadians in the second week of October.
The results were little changed from last year's poll when 58 percent said their spending would equal 1994 levels, while 29 percent said they would spend less and 13 percent more.
The findings came despite Canada's lowest interest rates in almost 40 years after a series of rate cuts by the central bank and commercial lenders.
Anderson said this year's survey ""just shows you there's some underlying problems people have with respect to the level of debt and job security.""
Canadians have opted for paying down heavy debt loads rather than being spendthrift, he said. Many people still also fear for their jobs after years of layoffs, Anderson added.
""It's almost like (you are) looking for an excuse to curtail your spending,"" he said.
""But then again,"" he added, ""historically people have tended to say these things in October and then sort of spend normally when they get involved in the Christmas atmosphere.""

44,"She once jokingly thought of calling her autobiography ""Fascist Bitch,"" and now Canadian journalists are wondering what epithet to use as she plays an expanding role in the country's largest newspaper empire.
British-born Barbara Amiel, the wife of Hollinger Inc. chairman Conrad Black, is an accomplished journalist who counts many fans in Britain, where she writes a rightwing shoot-from-the-hip column for the Daily Telegraph, the centerpiece of the Hollinger empire.
Although she honed her craft in Canada, she makes many Canadians bristle by standing out from the mass of generally liberal journalists. She says she has never managed to reap the accolades she desires from Canadians, the ones she routinely receives from the British.
A sought-after London party guest, Amiel now is in the Canadian spotlight through her position as vice president of editorial in her husband's newspaper empire. Hollinger added a majority shareholding in Southam Inc., the country's largest daily newspaper chain, to its media stable, substantially boosting its control to more than 40 percent of the industry.
The move left some Canadians worried about Hollinger's influence on their media and many Southam journalists fearful for their jobs as Black's well-known road to profits often involves cutting newspaper staff.
HUSBAND CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF
At a recent conference of journalists in Ottawa, Amiel, a former Toronto Sun editor, was repeatedly asked about Black's intentions. She replied that he could speak for himself. But she added, ""I think the Southam papers ... have not done their best but have terrific potential.""
Amiel, who still writes for Maclean's magazine, hesitated when asked if she was treated differently in Canada than abroad. ""I think Canada's been very good to me. I became editor of a newspaper, (former editor) Peter Newman gave me a column in Maclean's magazine, how many people have got that? You can't complain.""
But then she added, ""I've never, although one always wants it, had the recognition of my peers that I've had in England, but then maybe I didn't deserve it in Canada.""
Television personality Alan Edmonds, an admirer of Amiel who disagrees with her views, said Canadians have refrained from praising Amiel's talents because of her rightwing bias. ""In the years that she was in Canada ... the prevailing mindset in the media was in the opposite direction.""
Edmonds said other journalists were jealous of the openings that came her way. ""She's used her undoubted feminine attraction to ... create opportunities to use her undoubted superior intellect.""
In person and in print, Amiel has a knack for sparking debates. For instance, she once wrote that Quebec's moves toward independence, culminating in a narrow 1995 defeat for the separatists, could be blamed on Canada's liberal elite, which promoted multi-culturalism, thereby strengthening French-Canadian nationalism.
CASTIGATING LEFTWINGERS
Her columns have castigated Ontario's former leftwing government, led by the New Democratic Party, for allegedly being swayed by special interest groups like the disabled. She also wrote that Ontario, which gave homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual ones, had weakened the family.
Canada's most widely read satirical magazine, Frank, noted ""a favorite theme in her columns is the insidiousness of self-pity, that the poor should get on with their lives and quit carping about it."" And columnist Allan Fotheringham once observed, ""Barbara Amiel, otherwise known as Mrs. Conrad Black, can take out any opponent in the world and eat them for breakfast. As she does regularly in print.""
Amiel has even joked about her reputation, saying she thought about calling her surprisingly frank 1980 autobiography ""Fascist Bitch,"" a name suggested by irate readers. Instead the book was titled ""Confessions.""
Now in her mid-50s, the much-married Amiel began her path at the tender age of eight at a ""grotty little newspaper"" in her hometown of Hendon, England. Her parents divorced, her mother remarried and her new Canadian stepfather dragged his new family back home. Amiel, used to fine surroundings, ended up in Hamilton, a gritty steel town in southern Ontario about 40 miles (70 km) from Toronto.
Before her 1991 marriage to Black, she was married to student Gary Smith, philosopher George Jonas and cable magnate David Graham, with whom she returned to England in 1985.
In 1993 well-known Canadian author Margaret Atwood published ""The Robber Bride"" about a scapel-assisted femme fatale named Zenia. The Canadian rumor mill identified Amiel as the model for Zenia, but she denied it.

16,"The restructuring of France's defence sector and the key role of state-owned Aerospatiale in the process are complicating moves by the European Airbus consortium to become a limited liability company, analysts say.
The four national firms in Airbus Industrie are studying the best way to convert the partnership into a faster, more efficient company able to compete with U.S. rival Boeing Co, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas Corp.
Aerospatiale, the French partner in the Airbus passenger plane venture, is also involved in two deals at the heart of France's defence industry consolidation -- the merger of Aerospatiale and combat plane-maker Dassault Aviation and the privatisation of electronics firm Thomson-CSF.
""It is consistent with French strategic thinking that you must first get your house in order, then negotiate from a position of strength,"" said an industry executive.
""Aerospatiale cannot do this today in the Airbus system. It has to have weight behind it. It will have that weight when the Dassault merger is complete,"" he added.
DASSAULT MERGER WILL BOOST AEROSPATIALE
The Dassault merger, due to be agreed this year, will add 13 billion francs ($2.2 billion) of annual turnover to Aerospatiale, creating a group with combined sales of 64 billion and giving Aerospatiale greater clout at the Airbus negotiating table.
A banker close to the Airbus talks said Aerospatiale is seen as the weakest of the senior Airbus partners -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Casa of Spain makes up the fourth Airbus partner.
But Aerospatiale will get an injection of aggressive, private-sector management with the Dassault merger.
Aerospatiale executives complain bitterly that the foreign media does not give them due credit for their industrial restructuring which turned the company round to post a 1996 net attributable profit of 812 million francs, after years of losses, and recorded sales of 51 billion francs.
Their exasperation is palpable when they say their public sector tag is seen as a weakness when compared to the private sector BAe and Dasa.
But analysts point out that Aerospatiale was slower in attacking its cost structure and still needs to improve.
BAe underwent drastic pruning in the early 1990s, going from an empire with property, cars and military interests to a group focused on defence and aerospace. It posted 1996 pretax profits of 425 million pounds ($690.3 million), on sales of 7.44 billion pounds.
Dasa, although loss-making, has the industrial and financial strength of parent Daimler-Benz AG which has set a management target of a 12 percent return on capital. Dasa posted 1996 turnover of 13 billion marks ($7.6 billion), making it smaller than BAe and Aerospatiale, but it has huge ambitions for Airbus.
A business consultant said Aerospatiale had excellent programmes, but its military projects were 30 percent more costly than those of BAe and Dasa.
THOMSON-CSF SALE ENHANCES PROSPECTS
Apart from the Dassault merger, Aerospatiale also holds a key hand in the Thomson-CSF sell-off.
The government has said bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere will have to take into account Aerospatiale's interests when putting together their offers for Thomson-CSF.
Even though Aerospatiale, as a state-controlled company, cannot take part directly in the privatisation, it will be affected by the outcome and chairman Yves Michot will give his views to the government on the rival bids.
French newspapers have reported that Michot will have to observe strict neutrality in the contest. But it is clear Alcatel's plans would significantly strengthen Aerospatiale, giving it more weight against BAe and Dasa.
If Alcatel won Thomson-CSF, it would create a missiles joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, and a satellite venture between Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF.
Lagardere has said it wants a dialogue with Aerospatiale to prepare its bid. Relations between the two firms have been strained as they compete in missiles and satellites.
""The perimeter of Aerospatiale is not yet defined,"" said the industry executive.
The government plans to decide on the Thomson-CSF bids by June 30.
AEROSPATIALE NEEDS AIRBUS, WILL MAKE IT WORK
Aerospatiale stands to gain from the defence moves and is in no hurry to bow to pressures from BAe and Dasa to rush into an Airbus agreement which does not suit its own interests.
However, Airbus is vitally important for Aerospatiale. Its 38 percent stake in Airbus contributed the biggest slice of 1996 operating profit, 1.175 billion francs, and around 70 percent of sales.
Analysts believe that of the Airbus big three, Aerospatiale needs Airbus the most, and that BAe and Dasa could walk away if relations broke down irreparably.
BAe has a 20 percent Airbus stake and has bigger military interests, while Dasa's parent Daimler-Benz gets most of its money from the auto business, through Mercedes trucks and cars.
Aerospatiale has, paradoxically, maximalist and minimalist aims for the new Airbus company.
For the short term, Michot argues that the present arrangement with Airbus has proved its worth, winning a third of the world market. A much bigger manufacturing concern could overstretch the management, it reasons.
In the long term however, Michot would like Airbus to have a military wing, to balance out economic cycles with government contracts.
The Airbus partners said in January they agreed in principle on the change to a single integrated company, in which the new Airbus would own its factories and design offices. Work is going on this year on valuing the assets to be vested in the new firm.
That valuation is complicated as some of the factories mix civil and military programmes, and some plants are efficient while others are uncompetitive.
One way of viewing the Airbus negotiations is through the prism of conflicting cultural visions.
""This country (France) has a vision of long-term industrial strategy. It wants to be a world power and be a dominant player in the aircraft industry,"" said the industry executive. Without that vision, Airbus arguably would never have got funds to launch its first plane in the early 1970s.
Set against that long-term strategic view, is the British insistence on short-term returns for shareholders, summed up as ""Let the City decide"". ($ = 5.790 French Francs) ($ = 0.615 British Pounds) ($ = 1.716 German Marks)

16,"Air France, wracked by labour strife on Easter weekend at its domestic unit and facing increased competition in regional markets, held on Friday to its aim of breaking even in 1997 and being privatised quickly.
The company will officially lose its national monopoly from April 1, when domestic air travel in the European Union is opened up to competition from European carriers.
Jean-Claude Baumgarten, special adviser to Air France chairman Christian Blanc, speaking in a telephone interview from Osaka, Japan, said ""Yes"" when asked if the group was on track for break-even and a share sale in late 1997 or early 1998.
The group is maintaining its estimate of a 200-million franc loss for 1996/97 at the Air France international airline while losses at the Air France Europe domestic wing should be less than a forecast 800 million, he said.
Those results should allow the group to be sold later this year or early in 1998, he said. But first, Blanc must push through a merger between Air France and Air France Europe.
The merger move sparked a surprise strike on Friday by Air France Europe ground staff, who are protesting against their pay and conditions being brought in line with those of Air France employees when the merger goes ahead in September.
Similar pay concerns lie behind a two-day strike starting on Easter Monday, called by Air France Europe flight crew.
Junior Transport Minister Anne-Marie Idrac sounded a cautious note in an interview in Friday's edition of the French newspaper Le Monde.
""The privatisation of Air France is written in the 1993 law...But the merger between Air France and Air France Europe has to be completed before launching the privatisation,"" she said.
""The market has to be ready to absorb Air France shares ...the company's accounts need to inspire confidence. The question is whether six months will be enough. It is in the light of this recovery that we will set the final calendar,"" she said.
Baumgarten said Air France Europe, formerly Air Inter, should be close to break-even in 1997/98 and that last year's launch of low-price ""Le Shuttle"" services between Paris and Toulouse, Marseilles and Nice was paying off.
The Shuttle is a key part of Air France's hold on the domestic market, which together with European traffic, contributes 42 percent to group sales. It is this market which is under attack from European carriers such as British Airways Plc (BA) through its French TAT European Airlines unit.
France is the biggest domestic market in Europe, he said.
Last year saw a savage price war, with ticket discounts of 20 percent, which bled privately held Air Liberte into bankrupcty and acquisition by BA and merger with TAT. French airline AOM was also engaged in the domestic competition.
The Shuttle ""is at least breaking even,"" Baumgarten said. It has helped Air France Europe regain market share lost to high-speed TGV intercity trains and rival airlines, and has stabilised yields - as measured in revenue per passenger per kilometre transported - at minus one percent compared to minus 20 percent. The load factor - the number of passengers carried - was also climbing.
Baumgarten said the three-city service showed France was ready for a shuttle product, which could be rolled out to other French cities and feed the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.
""The name of the game is extending the network,"" he said. But because the big carriers such as Air France, BA, KLM and Lufthansa have invested heavily in building up their hubs, they will draw on small regional airlines to add the domestic spokes to feed the hub.
Leasing, chartering, code-sharing and franchises with low-cost companies equipped with small planes are the tools to building up that network, he said. Air France currently has relationships with Britair and Eurowings for European coverage.
With more feeder routes, Air France can boost long-haul traffic through the Paris hub, also benefiting its U.S. partners Delta and Continental and Japanese ally Japan Airlines (JAL), he said.
"
16,"French missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere confirmed on Thursday it will make an offer in the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF when the deadline falls due.
A Lagardere spokesman said the company would make its intentions known on Friday, but he gave no details.
The French government set March 28 as the deadline for intentions to bid for its 58 percent stake in Thomson-CSF, with firm and final offers due by May 7 and a decision by June 30.
Engineering giant Alcatel Alsthom has said it is making a joint bid with privately-owned Dassault Industries, which would bring in radar maker Dassault Electronique and in the wake of a successful bid, would cooperate with state-owned Aerospatiale.
Thomson-CSF makes missiles, radars, aircraft avionics, training simulators and telecomunications systems. It made 1996 net attributable profit of 745 million francs ($131.4 million) on sales of 36.27 billion francs.
Analysts view the Thomson-CSF sale as a key step in rationalising the fragmented French industry, which is needed to prepare a consolidation in Europe. The task is made all the more urgent as U.S. firms merge rapidly to form defence and civilian groupings which dwarf their foreign rivals.
France currently has three missile firms - Lagardere's Matra, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF, three satellite poles - Alcatel, Aerospatiale and Matra, two military communications players - Thomson-CSF and Alcatel, and two radar makers - Thomson-CSF and Dassault Electronique.
Thus the government, in its sale terms and conditions, called for the biggest possible industrial grouping around Thomson-CSF, to cut out duplication in scarce research and development funds and boost the economies of scale.
The terms did not set any nationality restrictions for bidding, which sparked speculation British electronics giant GEC Plc could throw its hat in the ring or line up behind Alcatel, to gain an entry into Thomson-CSF.
Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk has said he hoped to agree defence deals with GEC and Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa) of Germany if he won the prize.
Meanwhile, British Aerospace Plc has said it is ""standing by to provide assistance"" to a bid from Lagardere, with which it has the Matra BAe Dynamics missiles joint venture.
For the Dassault family, joining Alcatel for the Thomson-CSF bid means a chance to keeping control of its Rafale combat jet, a 25-year, multi-billion franc acquisition for the French air force and navy. Potential export sales add further allure.
A banker close to the deal said since electronics make up maybe a third of the value of a modern jet, a win by Lagardere of Thomson-CSF could give it a majority of value in the Rafale once its Matra missile systems are added. That would give it a potential claim to be the prime contractor, ousting Dassault, and boosting its margins. ($ = 5.668 French Francs)

16,"State-owned Air France is under pressure from the French government to drop any thought of buying Boeing long-haul jets from the U.S. and stick with the French-based Airbus equivalent, industry sources said on Friday.
They said that Air France chairman Christian Blanc flew into a political storm after saying on Thursday that the French flag carrier might use a mix of Boeing and Airbus planes in its planned new long-haul fleet, expected to cost some $1 billion.
One industry source said the pressure on Blanc had come from Transport Minister Bernard Pons.
""It's clear there is extremely strong political pressure,"" head of the SNPL pilots union Geoffrey Bouvet said on Friday.
Blanc on Thursday told the business newspaper Les Echos there was no conflict in flying both the Airbus 340 and Boeing 777 aircraft.
""They are complementary...Today like yesterday, we need both Airbus and Boeing."" He added that he did not expect government opposition if the company bought from both European Airbus Industrie consortium and arch-rival Boeing.
""The minister, having talked to Airbus, has been told that there will be an equivalent Airbus product. It is perfectly natural that he ask the national company to invest in Airbus,"" a transport ministry spokeswoman said.
Any decision will go to Prime Minister Alain Juppe for ratification, the transport ministry spokeswoman said.
France's state-owned Aerospatiale is a senior partner in Airbus. The others are British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.
At the heart of the debate, apart from technical merits of the fleet, is Blanc's desire to run the airline as a ""normal"" company along commercial lines, free of political intervention.
Blanc's mandate is to turn round the airline, prepare it for privatisation and deregulation of European air travel from 1997. He has forecast the group was on track to break even this year.
Because of the political sensitivity, a committee of Air France board members was formed to evaluate the products and will submit its conclusion on December 20.
The union's Bouvet said Air France should be left to choose the right planes for particular routes rather than have a fleet imposed by the government. A mixed fleet could make economic sense, if a world class airline such as Singapore Airlines could fly both Airbus and Boeing, he said.
Air France is expected to order between five and 10 planes.
The official list price for the A340-300 is around $120 million. The plane seats 295 passengers in a typical three-class layout and can fly up to 7,300 nautical miles or 13,500 km.
The Boeing 777 flies in two basic versions. The 777-200 seats between 305 to 328 in three classes and has a catalogue price of $128-146 million, and has a range of 3,780 nautical miles, or 7,000 km.
The 777-300, officially priced at $151 million-170 million, seats between 368 and 394, flies 5,380 miles or 9,970 km.
A Boeing spokesman said the company has made a number of offers to Air France using different product mixes.
Airbus itself declined to comment.
The Air France operating company in June reported a first-half operating profit of 413 million francs compared with a loss of 902 million in the first half of 1995.

16,"A restructuring agreed between Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA /Plc and bank negotiators on its 69.6 billion francs of debt was a ""robust"" deal, French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said on Monday.
He told a news conference the restructuring was robust as it would eliminate a total 16 billion francs of debt by swapping eight billion of loans into equity and a further eight billion for equity notes.
The plan secured the company's future until 2003, when the London-Folkestone high-speed rail link would be built, he said.
""After 2003 we will see an explosion of revenues from the railways,"" Ponsolle said.
The restructuring meant the interest bill would be fixed at 5.2 percent or 3.21 billion francs for the seven-year period. That rate was much lower than market rates, the company said.
If there is a cashflow shortage to repay interest, it will be able to draw down on stabilisation notes, which are effectively a credit line, free of interest until January 2006.
The plan also pushed back the debt repayment periods by a significant period, Ponsolle said. The resettable bonds mature in 2050, the participating loan notes in 2040, the remaining junior debt in 2025 and stabilisation notes in 2026.
Eurotunnel has also negotiated the right to refinance all its debt after 2004, free of penalties, to benefit from any improvement in market conditions. Previously, that refinancing incurred heavy financial penalties.
The deal had been worked out using a wide range of scenarios and sought to preserve the company's future and independence, Ponsolle said. ""It is the best compromise under the circumstances. The sacrifices for shareholders and banks are equal and equitable.""
The two chief aims of the deal were ""to preserve a clear majority for the shareholders and to ensure long-term financial stability,"" he said.
Although the company planned to pay a first dividend in around 10 years, if it performed very well it could make a payment at the date envisaged in the 1994 rights issue -- 2004.
Asked what would happen if shareholders rejected the deal, Ponsolle said, ""I think we would go back to the choices at the starting point. The starting point was either we come to a friendly agreement or insolvency.""
""I think, contrary to some, an insolvency could only be a catastrophe for the small shareholders.""
Prices should rise ""to a reasonable level"" following the merger announcement last week of P&amp;O and Stena of their cross-Channel operations, Ponsolle said.
The merger news had come as a surprise to Eurotunnel, which had not expected such a move until later, perhaps in 1997, he said.
The earliest Eurotunnel could hold a shareholders' meeting to vote on the deal would be late March or early April, he said.

16,"Talk of a merger between the Airbus European passenger plane venture and U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin was premature but the two groups do have interests which would benefit from a link up, Airbus's French partner said on Saturday.
""It's premature,"" Aerospatiale vice president for corporate communications Patrice Kreis said when asked about a report in the London Times newspaper which said Airbus Industrie and Lockheed Martin were in merger talks.
""Airbus's interests and Lockheed's interests are to merge (eventually),"" he said, in the face of a pending merger by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The merged Boeing-McDonnell group ""want not only to dominate the market but to take it over completely,"" he said.
But it was too early to talk about linking up Airbus with Lockheed as European aerospace and defence companies needed to consolidate among themselves, before tackling a transatlantic merger, he said. ""There's a lot of work to do,"" he added.
Among the key steps to be taken are current moves to changing Airbus's partnership into a limited liability company. But that should occur in the context of a rationalisation of European civil and military aviation, space and weapons systems, he said.
""Airbus on its own will not survive. Everything is linked -- civilian aircraft, military aircraft, space and weapons systems,"" he said. The creation in the United States of titans such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, which embrace all these sectors, is forcing Europe to do the same.
The European consolidation would be through changes in capital at the parent-company level rather than cooperation on specific projects favoured in the past.
Important steps are being taken in France in the restructuring, with a merger of state-owned Aerospatiale and combat-plane maker Dassault Aviation, and the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF, both due to be realised this year.
Aerospatiale's chairman Yves Michot has said he was talking to Lockheed to collaborate with Airbus on specific projects.
Lockheed could become a partner in the crucial Airbus project to build a 555-seater plane, the A3XX, to rival Boeing's monopoly of the large capacity segment with its 747 jumbo.
Aerospatiale had no comment on the timing of any Lockheed decision to join the A3XX project, which has already signed up Italy's Alenia, part of the Finmecanicca group, and Saab of Sweden as potential risk-sharing partners.
Lockheed Martin and Aerospatiale both have interests in civil and military aircraft -- Lockheed makes fuselages for Boeing passenger planes, makes large military transports, and is also a prime contractor for the U.S. new-generation F22 fighter.
Aerospatiale makes Airbus cockpit systems and assembles the planes at its plant in Toulouse, southwestern France. It is also a key partner in the planned European Future Large Aircraft (FLA) military transport.
British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG and Casa of Spain are the other Airbus partners working on changing it to an integrated company by 1999.

16,"Holding company Cie de Suez  and utility Lyonnaise des Eaux must tell shareholders how they will benefit from the groups' planned merger, otherwise the deal will look like a defensive move, analysts said on Friday.
The boards of Suez and Lyonnaise are expected to approve later on Friday terms of the merger which will create a group with annual sales of about 200 billion francs ($35 billion) and a market capitalisation of 75 billion.
But size is not necessarily a bonus if the new group cannot bring operating companies together and if Suez is not allowed to sell Belgian financial assets to shed its conglomerate status and focus on utilities.
""If there is no link-up between Lyonnaise and Suez, the merger makes little sense. It looks like a defensive move,"" a share analyst said.
Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio on Friday that the new group would have four core businesses -- energy, water distribution, waste management and communications.
""What do shareholders stand to gain?"" a second analyst asked. ""There is still uncertainty,"" he added.
In the short term, Suez shareholders can look forward to  a big cash payout as part of the merger terms, with a dividend estimated at around 24 francs per share, or a total of some 3.8 billion francs.
They are also getting a chance to cut the discount on Suez shares compared with underlying assets -- if the new group buries Suez's holding company image by selling financial assets to concentrate on utilities, as promised.
Suez investors will also gain by getting shares in Lyonnaise, which for all its past weakness, is one of France's biggest companies and harbours big expansion ambitions.
But Suez holders still need to be convinced on big issues related to the merger.
The merger is being structured as a Lyonnaise takeover of Suez, apparently to take advantage of Suez's tax loss carry-forward, which would shelter future profits of the new group. ""This needs to be clarified,"" said an analyst.
For Lyonnaise shareholders, the deal looks more risky.
They do not know if Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet has made guarantees of management freedom to the Belgian government for the Societe Generale de Belgique holding company, which groups choice industrial and financial assets.
Any commitments may inhibit SGB's disposal of Belgian financial assets, which include stakes in banking giant Generale de Banque and insurer Fortis.
French investment in Belgium has become a sensitive issue since Renault SA's decision to close its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels at heavy cost to jobs.
The Belgian authorities insist on keeping the Tractebel utilities company, 50.3 percent owned by SGB, independent and headquartered in Belgium. This may limit the scope for integrating Tractebel into Lyonnaise's global ambitions.
Howver, Tractebel could benefit from asset transfers from Lyonnaise, such as the Elyo energy subsidiary.
The disposal of Suez's French financial units such as consumer credit house Sofinco, property broker Banque Monod and insurer Henin Vie, pose less of a problem.
Credit Agricole, which last year bought Banque Indosuez, has an option to buy 20 percent of Sofinco next year.
Lyonnaise shareholders stand to gain an injection of fresh capital which the company needs to finance its global aspirations. But if the Suez disposals do not go according to plan, they will be left with a conglomerate on their hands, with the accompanying discount on the shares. ($ = 5.789 French Francs)

16,"European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie on Friday attacked as ""anti-competitive"" a deal under which the U.S. airline Delta will buy new aircraft exclusively from its archrival Boeing for the next quarter century.
Delta Air Lines Inc said on Thursday it had named Boeing Co as its sole aircraft supplier for the next 25 years, as it announced a $6.7 billion order for 106 Boeing aircraft. Options would bring the total to 644 aircraft.
The Delta deal, potentially worth more than $15 billion, follows a similar ""exclusive"" deal between Boeing and AMR Corp's American Airlines.
""We are not afraid of competition, we can sell our planes on their own merits,"" said an Airbus spokeswoman. She said Boeing was trying to buy out the competition with exclusive deals which lock an airline into a long-term commitment.
""It's destroying competition"" in the long term, she said.
Such deals could be bad for airlines and passengers if Boeing, which is already in a dominant position globally, forced out Airbus and gave the U.S. manufacturer room to raise prices, she said.
""If Airbus is forced out of the market, prices would go up, which is not in the interests of the public.""
Asked if Airbus was planning an anti-trust action on the Delta deal, she said: ""If we were asked by any of the official instances (authorities), we will of course be ready to talk to them.""
Boeing, which has around 60 percent of the world civil aircraft market, is merging with McDonnell Douglas which has around 10 percent. The merged group would have annual sales of $48 billion.
That merger plan is being investigated by the European Commission
Delta's deal with Boeing will allow it to streamline its fleet, reduce maintenance and training costs and retire older planes to lower operating costs.
American Airlines said last November it would buy planes solely from Boeing to 2018. It ordered 103 jets and took options on more than 500 in a deal that could be worth well over $30 billion.
Airbus, which ad 1996 sales of $8.8 billion, is a consortium of four European companies that are in talks to convert it from a partnership into a limited liability company by 1999.
The four partners are French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.

16,"The French government said on Tuesday it was ready to relaunch the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF and appointed key executives to oversee the sale.
""The government has just taken the decisions necessary for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF to enter the operational phase,"" the industry and finance ministries said in a joint statement.
An attempt to sell the whole Thomson electronics group last year floundered when the independent Privatisation Commission rejected the sale of parent company Thomson SA to the missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere Groupe for a symbolic one franc.
The government said on Tuesday it would make Marcel Roulet, formerly chairman of both Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF, responsible for the sale of the defence subsidiary on a full-time basis. He will now only be chairman of Thomson-CSF.
It also appointed Thierry Breton, formerly a deputy chairman of French computer maker Cie des Machines Bull, as chairman of state-owned Thomson SA and its wholly-owned consumer electronics unit, Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
Breton will be responsible for privatising TMM and will shortly make proposals on the sale, the statement said.
The government will inject 11 billion francs ($1.9 billion) of fresh capital into TMM by the summer, following approval from the European Commission.
TMM, which makes television sets and video cassette recorders, will be sold gradually through an opening up of its capital, the statement said.
A key objection by the Privatisation Commission to the government's first privatisation attempt was a planned sale by Lagardere of loss-making TMM to the South Korean Daewoo Electronics group for one franc.
Lagardere wanted to retain Thomson-CSF and merge its Matra Defense Espace unit with Thomson to create an integrated defence company with radar, satellite and missile interests.
The government has now decided to sell Thomson-CSF, 58 percent owned by Thomson SA, separately from TMM.
Detailed terms and conditions are expected to be announced shortly, opening the way for companies to make fresh bids for Thomson-CSF. Both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom have said they are interested.
TMM last week posted a 1996 net attributable loss of 3.1 billion francs, which included hefty provisions for factory closures and the expected loss of up to 10,000 jobs.
But it expects to break even at the operating level next year and be profitable from 1999 when U.S. patent revenues come on stream.
Thomson-CSF announced last week it returned to profit in 1996 after three years of losses, showing a net attributable profit of 745 million francs. ($ = 5.747 French Francs)

16,"Shareholder democracy will grab the spotlight when investors in the troubled Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA/Plc vote on a complex debt deal aimed at keeping the company afloat.
The restructuring agreement with its bank lenders requires a two-thirds majority at an extraordinary meeting of shareholders expected to be held by March.
Potentially, two French shareholder groups could muster a blocking minority but the associations hold distinct positions and styles. Of Eurotunnel's estimated 750,000 small investors, around 600,000 are French.
Albert Jauffret heads the newer and smaller Association de Defence des Actionnaires d'Eurotunnel (Adacte), considered by some as the more ""extremist"" -- but possessing clear and strongly-held views on the restructuring and what he wants.
""Whether one agrees with his views or not he represents a group of shareholders and shareholder democracy requires each shareholder has a voice,"" said lawyer Sophie L'Helias, who acted as proxy agent for more than 20,000 Eurotunnel shareholders.
Jauffret, a retired headmaster, believes the restructuring gives too much to the banks. ""We are very unhappy the debt is being treated at face value,"" he said.
In London's secondary debt market, Eurotunnel's 70 billion francs ($13.40 billion) of junior-ranked loans have been marked down to about 40 percent of face value, on a view they are distressed assets.
CALL FOR SOME DEBT CANCELLATION
The 225 lending banks should cancel at least a third of the debt, taking their lead from the market's valuation, instead of keeping most of the debt intact, Jauffret argues.
The restructuring takes out eight billion francs of loans to be swapped for shares at 10.40 francs per share.
The loans outstanding should be converted into Eurotunnel shares at 24 francs per share, the average level of the last three rights issues by Eurotunnel, Jauffret believes.
Adacte is highly critical of Eurotunnel's managers, whom Jauffret believes are cowed by its bankers. At the annual general meeting in June, he moved a resolution, which was easily defeated, to sack co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle along with six other executives, considered too close to the banks.
Adacte, which held proxies for about four percent of the votes at the AGM, was founded in September 1995 as a breakaway from the Eurotunnel shareholders association.
Christian Cambier, who runs the Prigest portfolio management company, heads the Eurotunnel shareholders association which was set up in 1992 and has around 3,000 members, most of whom are professional workers rather than the retired folk who make up Adacte.
DIFFERENT APPROACHES
The difference in constituencies partly explains the divergent approaches. Adacte members are angered by the loss of life savings, while Cambier's have limited losses to spare investment income, said one observer.
The contrasting styles was shown clearly after Eurotunnel announced the restructuring agreement with its bankers.
Adacte denounced it as a ""declaration of war"", because it did not cancel any debt. In contrast, the Eurotunnel shareholders association said it would seek a meeting with management to get more details.
""We support the management,"" Cambier says, adding that he does not want to change the board. He spends perhaps five percent of his time on Eurotunnel and the rest managing client funds.
Cambier does not fundamentally object to the restructuring but says the operating licence needs to be extended to 99 years from 65, to allow the company extra time to make money.
His clients hold around 1.5 million Eurotunnel shares and lend them in stock-lending operations, which he says poses no conflict of interest. They gain a running yield each month, even though the shares have fallen sharply in value.
However, both Cambier and Jauffret share common ground when they accuse some of Eurotunnel's banks and brokers of conflicts of interest.
They accuse some of the underwriters for the 1994 rights issue of short selling the shares in the months before the May capital increase.
Cambier garnered a near blocking minority of around 32 percent of the votes at the AGM, after a ground-breaking proxy solicitation, and wants to improve on that for the crucial EGM.
He says he will base his voting on the share price. If Eurotunnel trades below five francs, he will take that as the market's no-confidence in the restructuring, but if it is between 10 and 15 francs, he will approve the deal. ($1=5.225 French Franc)

7,"Sprint Corp said core local and long distance operations are performing with unprecedented strength, but its results in 1997 will be diluted by investments required to sustain future strength.
""We have our core operations producing as they have never produced before,"" chief operating officer Ronald LeMay told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
""We are investing in the future. That will show in our results in 1997, no question about that.  That will show as dilution in EPS (earnings per share),"" he said.
The company said it already told analysts its expectations that 1997 would see increased spending.  The company reports 1996 results on February 4.
First Call's consensus of analysts's earnings estimates was $2.93 per share in 1996, up from $2.89 reported in 1995 and $2.47 in 1994.
Analysts said they heard the same on spending from MCI Communications Corp, but not from AT&amp;T Corp. However, AT&amp;T has been hit by a wave of lowered analyst estimates, on the assumption it will also spend more. 
In Sprint's case, LeMay said that participation in the U.S. government auctions for D and E bands of radio spectrum would be a major part of the outlay, as the company filled in a few remaining gaps in its national wireless network.
The D and E band bidding process is continuing.  A spokesman said Sprint has so far bid $550 million, and would also incur costs to build networks in those license areas.
The D &amp; E band auctions are the latest for wireless licenses for personal communications services (PCS), which allow clear connections, tiny phones and in-built pagers and voicemail. 
Investments in telephone operations and in the Global One business venture with French and German partners would also affect 1997, he said.  Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom share a 20 percent stake in Sprint.
""What we are asking investors to do is look at our core capabilities,"" LeMay said, adding, ""We had the best year since 1989 in long distance last year.""
He said Sprint was not being damaged by small, aggressive resellers in the long distance market.
""We can see their efforts in the marketplace, but we have not suffered the impact nearly that AT&amp;T has had,"" LeMay said.  
The company, which gets two-thirds of its long distance revenues from business customers, has not seen any change in customer turnover, or churn, during 1996.
""Churn comes and goes, but it is not materially different from a year ago,"" LeMay said.

7,"MCI Communications Corp., embracing merger partner British Telecommunications Plc  in a $20 billion match, is growing increasingly distant toward media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and their joint offspring.
At the same time, BT and MCI are seeking Asian telecom partners for Concert, their new global company.
MCI said on Sunday it would cut its stake in a U.S. satellite joint venture with Murdoch's News Corp from 50 percent to 20 percent.
MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts told Reuters that no major new launches were expected from the $400 million media joint venture with Murdoch's News Corp, and that MCI would sell to Murdoch a $700 million satellite license if it could.
MCI has a stake of just under 9 percent in News Corp, which it bought for $1.35 billion, and has an option to splash out an extra $1 billion to take this to 13.5 percent.
""It is unlikely you will see us increasing our investment (in News Corp)"" Roberts told Reuters in an interview. He said that News Corp was aware of MCI's position.
This is all a world away from the first flush of enthusiasm when Murdoch and Roberts announced a broad-ranging alliance in May 1995.
The plan was to take the Australian magnate's publishing and television expertise and put it together with MCI's communications network and marketing skill, especially in the emerging market of the Internet.
But so far, the venture has produced some duds.
MCI's electronic malls on the Internet are now closed, and News Corp's ideas of producing supermarket tabloids to lure middle-aged readers to the Internet have been shelved.
Low-level cross-promotion, like advertising MCI calling cards in Murdoch's U.S. TV Guide, have continued.
The crux of the problem, analysts say, is that there never was much overlap between MCI's blue-chip business clients and Murdoch's blue-collar sports and publishing expertise.
""BT/MCI is going after the High Street, not Melrose Place,"" said Danny Briere, an industry analyst at consultancy Telechoice.
The satellite offspring American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB) has been a problem child, expensive and slow to develop in comparison with some rivals.
In January, MCI and News Corp said they would offer digital television direct to the home across the U.S. market within two years, using the $700 million license MCI won in an auction.
But the same month, AT&amp;T announced an alliance with General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics  DirecTV, a company that was already offering digital satellite services, and which now has two million subscribers.
MCI is clearly taking a second look.
""We would be willing, consistent with our lowering our investment position (in ASkyB), to move those to News Corp. That will take FCC approval,"" Roberts said.
BT Chairman Sir Iain Vallance said he expected to look hard for new partners to fill out the global telecommunications alliance in Asia.
""I think we will be more attractive to Asian partners than we would had we stayed separate,"" Vallance told Reuters in an interview. He declined to say which companies he had his eye on, but sources close to the company say Japan's NTT Corp. is considered the real prize.
Vallance said any partner would tie up closely to the business venture first.
""I think it is more likely that, in the first instance, we would invite partnership in Concert Communications Services rather than the parent itself,"" he said.
The source said that Concert would rely on chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield and his close links to the Japanese market to lure NTT aboard. Bonfield is a former head of ICL, a British computer company majority owned by Fujitsu Ltd. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610

7,"AT&amp;T Corp. is earning more, but having trouble getting paid.
The nation's largest telephone company said Wednesday that operating profits from continuing operations for the last quarter of 1996 rose 14 percent, but said it had to put aside $200 million to cover unpaid bills by customers.
The telecommunications company, which has now completed its split into three major units, said it earned $1.24 billion, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $1.09 billion, or 68 cents a share, in 1995's last quarter.
Chief financial officer Richard Miller told Wall Street analysts in a conference call that results for the first quarter of 1997 would be comparable or slightly above those of the fourth quarter.
Revenues in the latest period rose to $13.24 billion from $12.89 billion.
The Basking-Ridge, N.J.-based company's 1995 fourth-quarter operating profits excluded restructuring and other charges totaling $2.036 billion, or $1.27 a share. Including these charges, its net earnings from continuing operations resulted in a loss of $948 million, or 59 cents a share.
Competition has brought the company a new headache.
""It used to be if you don't pay your phone bill you didn't get phone service. Now with multiple suppliers, we can shut off their service, but they can go someplace else to get service,"" Miller told Reuters.
The problem is worst among business users, particularly the hundreds of tiny long-distance resellers, some of whom go bankrupt after ordering millions of network minutes from carriers like AT&amp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. in order to compete with them.
AT&amp;T's fourth-quarter operating net per share was three cents below the 79 cents industry analysts had forecast, according to First Call, mainly on the extra $200 million in provisions for bad debts.
As a result, some analysts lowered their 1997 estimates.
""No one was expecting that,"" said Bear Stearns analyst Bette Massick. ""You have to cut your number on that alone.""
For all of 1996, AT&amp;T's income from continuing operations rose to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion for 1995, excluding the charges. Earnings per share for 1996 were $3.47, a 5.5 percent increase over $3.29 per share in 1995.
Total 1996 revenues were $52.2 billion, a 3 percent increase over 1995's $50.7 billion.
""AT&amp;T had a record year in 1996 in the face of extraordinary challenges and unprecedented changes in our business and in our industry,"" said Chairman Robert E. Allen.
In September 1995, AT&amp;T said it would restructure its businesses, spinning off equipment company Lucent Technologies in September, and it completed with the spinoff of computer company NCR at the end of 1996.
AT&amp;T also sold its majority position in AT&amp;T Capital Corporation to a consortium of investors during the year.
AT&amp;T said its communications services revenue increased $529 million in the latest quarter, up 4.3 percent from the same period last year. Communications services revenues include wireline services and wireless services, as well as communications products and other services.
It said its long-distance calling volumes grew 6 percent over the same period in 1995 and 1.8 percent over the previous quarter.
""The growth in traffic volumes (3.2 percent) was better than the 2.5 percent we were expecting,"" said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber. ""But they are still losing market share to the tune of three percentage points a year,"" he said.
AT&amp;T's wireless services revenue, which includes cellular voice and data, messaging and air-to-ground services, grew 18.4 percent to $937 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. Its cellular service subscribers grew to 5.2 million, a 31.7 percent increase from a year ago.
Revenues from communications products and other services, which include consulting and outsourcing, on-line, and wireless product sales, were $386 million, an increase of nearly 17 percent from the year-ago quarter.
However, credit card revenue plunged 32.3 percent to $374 million, primarily as a result of the securitization program instituted at AT&amp;T Universal Card Services in 1995.
Credit card operating losses fell to $4 million in the fourth quarter from $35 million in the third quarter of 1996. In 1995's fourth quarter, it made an operating profit of $109 million.
AT&amp;T's stock closed 50 cents down at $38.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

7,"MCI Communications Corp is ducking the trench warfare in the consumer long distance telephone market by quietly using data warehousing  to target key customers who are unlikely to flee to the enemy.
MCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine said these customers are looking for advanced services, preferably in a package, but have hitherto been hard to pinpoint.
""It has taken tens of millions of dollars and many years to develop profiles of customers who can be targeted in our marketing,"" Maine told Reuters in an interview.  
Data warehousing requires powerful computers to assemble profiles of users from thousands of individual spending decisions and was a technique first applied by retailers.
""I always tell investors it is a hidden asset you cannot put a value on,"" Main said.
Sales people use these profiles to sell new services to existing customers, or target those of rivals who are likely to move across for the right services -- and stay.
""We've done this for some time in the business sales force,"" Maine said.  
The main enemy is churn, the tendency for some customers to switch between providers, which wastes all the marketing, promotional and administrative money spent recruiting them.
Third quarter results on Tuesday from MCI showed the benefits in the business and data markets that account for two-thirds of MCI's total revenues, but it is early days to see much improvement in the consumer market.
MCI said churn was higher than a year ago in the consumer market, but lower than in the second quarter.  
While AT&amp;T Corp slugs it out with tiny but tenacious resellers in a costly battle for customers using millions of dollars in promotional ammunition, MCI has cut its promotional spending for customer sign-ons by 70 percent from a year ago.
Maine said MCI One, a service package on one bill, has no sign-on bonus but half of new users take the Internet service. MCI One users are five times as likely to take cellular and calling cards than when services are billed separately.  
It is not just a land war. MCI has cross promotions with Northwest Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc, seeing overlaps between frequent fliers and heavy users of calling cards and wireless services.
Offering free air miles is much cheaper than offering cash, but just as alluring to certain markets.
""Our line-up gives us access to 70 percent of frequent fliers,"" said Maine.
Maine said that AT&amp;T and Sprint Corp have been mining their databanks too, and the whole industry will have a headstart against the regional Bells, which are much newer to the game, when markets are all open to competition.
Despite all its data warehousing, MCI still makes errors.
MCI said it is in the process of revamping its paging services, which resell the networks of Paging Network Inc and Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp after it discovered heavy churn.
Paging customers in the third quarter fell to 342,000 from 474,000 the previous quarter, and are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter too before a recovery seen for 1997. -- New York Newsroom  212 859 1712

7,"A $22 billion merger between British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp looks as good as agreed, crystallising the largest ever international business combination in record time.
Analysts and consultants said on Saturday that news of a London news conference at 8 a.m. EST (1300 GMT) on Sunday means the boards needed minimal time to wrap up the deal after the negotiations were reported on Friday.
MCI announced it would hold a news conference in New York at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT).
""At this point it really does sound like a done deal,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.
At the conference BT executives are likely to announce a $40 per share stock and cash offer valuing the 80 percent of MCI that it doesn't already own at $22.1 billion, and the entire company at $28 billion, analysts said.
If BT, with a market capitalisation of around 22.2 billion stg ($36.3 billion) uses mainly stock to foot the bill, it could mean MCI shareholders would own up to 37 percent of the combined company.
As a single company BT/MCI would be a true colossus, with revenues of $38 billion, 182,000 employees and a market value of $64 billion.
In the international big league it would be behind only Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp of Japan and AT&amp;T Corp of the United States. In Europe, it would be roughly the same size as Deutsche Telekom AG.
MCI directors, meeting on Saturday in ""The Mausoleum,"" the name MCI staff give to their granite-domed Washington headquarters, have reason to be well pleased with the deal.
Analysts say MCI management will be left in charge of the U.S. market, and be given more money to fight in new markets and defend existing ones in the new deregulated environment.
""It is inconceivable to me that BT would change the MCI management,"" Kagan said.
For MCI the deal brings a 30 percent fillip to a stock price that had languished for almost two years, but for BT the benefits may be more symbolic than actual, analysts say.
""What does BT get for its $22 billion?"" asked David Goodtree of Forrester Research.
""You only need a global strategy to serve big businesses and they already have their Concert venture to serve that market. Other markets are regional,"" he said.
Economies of scale would be hard to find. Both companies already squeeze their suppliers to the limit, their brands are already strong in their respective markets, and geography and local market knowledge will continue to dictate fortunes.
According to one source close to the deal, staff numbers are not going to be cut as part of the deal, although existing job and cost cutting initiatives will continue.
A final hurdle, long thought insuperable to such a deal, is U.S. regulatory objections. But regulatory experts say the Federal Communications Commission itself opened a loophole earlier this year.
The FCC made a ruling that said bidders from truly open markets would be allowed to exceed the 25 percent limit on foreign ownership of U.S. media and communication assets.
""BT's home U.K. market is the most open in Europe and arguably the most open in the world,"" said Bill Gaik, telecommunications director for Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting.

7,"The $20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommunications Plc will create a supercarrier posing a potent threat to rivals in the U.S. market place, industry analysts said Monday.
""In one company you have the resources of an AT&amp;T and the marketing savvy of an MCI,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.
The new company, Concert will have a market value of $54 billion, roughly the same as AT&amp;T Corp., and could spur more mega-mergers among U.S. carriers. MCI is currently the second largest U.S. long distance company behind AT&amp;T and has about 20 percent of the market.
""Its already going pretty fast. We have had four deals of over $10 billion since April. But we are going to get more,"" said analyst Guy Woodlief of Dean Witter Reynolds.
The regional Bells as well as GTE Corp., AT&amp;T Corp. and Sprint Corp. will all have to re-examine their market strategies and see where they may be vulnerable.
""It clearly ups the competitive ante for the whole industry,"" said analyst Julie Kennedy of Goldman Sachs.
Concert will push harder into the $90 billion local calling market, both through the MCI Metro venture it already has in major U.S. cities, and through resale of regional Bell circuits, as soon as possible.
""If BT is more prepared to take early losses than MCI is, you could see a renewed emphasis on local markets,"" Woodlief said, adding he expected to see marketing pushed harder.
AT&amp;T will have to concentrate hard now that it is looking eye-to-eye at a rival its own size.
""Two years out MCI could take the top spot from AT&amp;T domestically, which would have been unthinkable just one short year ago. Three years out you won't recognize this industry,"" Kagan said.
There are plenty of vital assets, like state-of-the-art nationwide networks in the hands of carriers who don't have enough money to make the most of them, analysts say.
""WorldCom Inc. is still definitely on the block,"" said David Goodtree, an analyst at consultancy Forrester Research.
WorldCom is in the process of buying business network provider MFS Communications Co. in a $13.3 billion deal. MFS has barely finished buying Internet access provider UUNet when the Worldcom deal was announced.
""Conventional wisdom says GTE or Bell Atlantic (Corp.) would buy WorldCom, but a dark horse would be Cable and Wireless Plc,"" Goodtree said. Britain's C&amp;W said Monday it would build a trans-Atlantic cable system with MFS.
GTE was a rumored bidder for MCI, while Bell Atlantic and Nynex Corp. agreed to merge in April. None of them, however, owns a national long distance network.
GTE already is offering long distance calling. Bell Atlantic and Nynex, and the other regional Bells will not legally be able to offer long distance until a legal impasse over U.S. telecommunications reform is solved.
The Federal Communications Commission's attempts to implement the 1996 Telecom Act have been stalled by a legal challenge. The FCC had set rules to govern the resale of Bell circuits to new rivals in the local calling market.
Debt-strapped Tele-Communications Inc., the largest U.S. cable television company, is another candidate for takeover as cable networks and phone networks combine.
""Another company ripe for acquisition is TCI. They don't have enough cash to do what they want to do,"" said Goodtree.
He suggested that AT&amp;T or Sprint would want to buy TCI. Sprint is already a partner with TCI and two other cable firms in a national venture called Sprint Spectrum to bundle local and long distance telephone, wireless and cable TV.
MCI shares added just 50 cents to $30.75 on Nasdaq on Monday, well down from the about $39 per share the deal is worth, reflecting concerns the FCC may block the deal and that approval in any case would take a year.
The deal's actual value varies with the movements of British Telecom shares. British Telecom American depositary shares on the New York Stock Exchange soared $6.125 to $61.625.
If the deal does go through, Concert could get even bigger, with more alliances likely by the time the regional Bells can get into long distance.
""I would assume within 36 months you will have one or more partners from the regional Bells joining the Concert alliance,"" said Joseph Kraemer, a consultant for A.T. Kearney.
Whatever happens, the market perception of the types of deals that can be done has changed.
""What you witnessed yesterday was the birth of a supercarrier,"" said Kagan.

7,"Two major Wall Street brokerages lowered their earnings estimates for AT&amp;T Corp. Monday amid growing competition in the industry, sparking a heavy sell-off of the stock.
The stock slid $2 to $39.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the second most-active issue. MCI Communications Corp. lost 75 cents to $33.125 on Nasdaq and Sprint Corp. also lost 75 cents to $39.25 on the NYSE in sympathy.
""It is in AT&amp;T's court,"" said analyst Barry Sine of SBC Warburg. ""The more they spend on marketing their new services for the long term, the lower 1997's results will be.""
The market was spooked by Salomon Brothers analyst Jack Grubman, who cited higher spending and greater competition in the telecommunications market. He cut his estimate of AT&amp;T's 1997 earnings to $3.00 per share from $3.60 and his 1998 estimate to $3.25 per share from $3.80.
Fourth-quarter 1996 earnings per share will be closer to 70 cents than the previously forecast of 78 cents, he added.
Grubman said his new estimates may ""still be too high,"" but he continued to recommend holding AT&amp;T stock.
AT&amp;T reported third-quarter profits of $1.4 billion, or 89 cents a share, on revenues of $13.2 billion.
First Boston Corp. also lowered its AT&amp;T earnings estimates, but agreed with most analysts that Salomon's view was too bearish.
""Salomon's number is for a dire outcome,"" said Frank Governali of First Boston, who expects AT&amp;T to earn $3.25 to $3.45 a share for 1997.
""I would be shocked if AT&amp;T diluted its 1997 earnings down to $3.00 per share,"" said Richard Klugman of PaineWebber.
AT&amp;T said it does not comment on stock activity or analysts' reports.
""We have not yet determined what 1997 will bring, but it is safe to say we do not agree with the more pessimistic comments,"" said a source at AT&amp;T who declined to be identified.
The source acknowledged the company was facing stiff competition from traditional rivals like MCI, as well as small aggressive competitors and soon, the regional Bells.
Governali said AT&amp;T had a choice to make: ""Either to run the business for 1997, in which case they could make $3.60 per share, or to position itself for the long-term, in which case there is no way they can"" earn that amount.
Analysts say the whole industry faces the same dilemma.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 will release the regional Bells into the long distance market place this year, on top of a horde of tiny rivals that have been nibbling away at the customers of the big three.
Though AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint can enter the local phone market, they will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to advertise their services, push their brand names and build network facilities to key business customers.
Grubman's research note said he believed AT&amp;T was losing hundreds of millions of dollars on its popular Worldnet Internet access service too, because of high costs.
Analysts said MCI and Sprint have already bitten the bullet by warning analysts of increased spending, but AT&amp;T had not done so.
""Sprint and MCI have already done it. MCI's merger with British Telecommunications Plc is a tacit admission of that fact (that you need very deep pockets to succeed),"" Governali said.
SBC Warburg's Sine said MCI told analysts it would spend an extra $200 million to $300 million this year on marketing, but the stock was not hit because it is supported by the value of the planned British Telecom merger, announced in November.
Separately, AT&amp;T said it won a $341 million contract from Delta Air Lines Inc. for worldwide voice and data services.
The seven-year contract extends an existing agreement between the two under which AT&amp;T provides a virtual network for the airline. The new contract will provide Delta with intelligent call-processing to reduce reservation backlogs.
In another announcement, a partner in an African consortium that is bidding to take over Ivory Coast's Ci-Telcom telephone company said AT&amp;T agreed to buy a 35 percent stake in the consortium, Africa Bell.
Ci-Telcom, with an estimated value of between $200 million to $350 million, is the most important company on Ivory Coast's privatisation programme.
AT&amp;T's involvement, if the Africa Bell bid succeeds, would represent a major breakthrough for an American company in a traditionally French domain. Ivory Coast is the most important economy in France's former colonies in West and Central Africa.

7,"AT&amp;T Corp's proposed successor to Robert Allen as chairman and chief executive will be a surprise, not one of those whose names have been mentioned in the press, sources close to the company said on Wednesday.
Neither Michael Armstrong, President of Hughes Electronics Corp nor William Esrey, chief executive of Sprint Corp are in contention, despite broad press speculation.
The sources declined to identify the true candidate.
AT&amp;T declined comment, as did Korn Ferry International and Spencer Stuart, the executive search firms involved.
AT&amp;T's board met earlier in the day to examine a slate of candidates put forward by the executive search groups for the post of president and chief operating officer, and sources expect an announcement in the next few days.
AT&amp;T reports its third quarter results on Thursday.
""The search had (already) been narrowed to a critical few... and the board, not just Bob Allen, will make the final decision,"" said one source, declining to be identified.
The post is vacant after Alex Mandl resigned in August to head a tiny new wireless company, Associated Communications.
One possibility is that Allen would split out the role of chief executive to the new candidate in a year or so but retain his chairmanship until nearer retirement.
Allen, a 32-year AT&amp;T career veteran would be reluctant to depart early, but in a recent press interview said he would consider it if a perfect candidate came along.
""AT&amp;T wants a world class marketer and technologist, with considerable experience of leading a major business,"" one source said.
It is unclear yet whether AT&amp;T will give a clear succession timetable in the announcement for the new post.
Armstrong, Esrey, Eastman Kodak Co chairman George Fisher and James Barksdale, chairman of Netscape Communications Corp, have ruled themselves out of the candidature, but this has not stopped the speculation.
Expectation of an earlier end to Allen's career has been fanned by AT&amp;T's profit warning in September in which it said earnings per share for the third quarter may be 10 percent below analysts expectations.
The warning crowned a bad year for the largest U.S. telecommunications firm.
AT&amp;T incurred the wrath of politicians and the media for announcing 40,000 job cuts in January, but an improved stock performance it was meant to produce has not appeared, so Wall Street and investors are not happy either.
While the company's split into three parts is going ahead as planned, the remainder of AT&amp;T is now more firmly wedded to long distance telecommunications services sector, in which competition is hotting up.

7,"Third quarter results at both MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp will be restrained by the cost of new ventures, and in Sprint's case the issue of new shares will lower per share earnings.
But analysts say both have so far escaped the problems which have hit AT&amp;T Corp in the consumer long distance market, and which led to AT&amp;T's profit warning in September.
""MCI will have increased earnings, but will continue the second quarter trend of slower long distance volume growth,"" Massick said Bette Massick of brokerage Bear Stearns.  
Sprint's earnings per share are expected to be lower than a year ago because of investment in the international Global One venture and in Personal Communications Services.
Sprint's shares in issue will rise to about 435 million, from 351 million a year ago, because of stock issued to partners Deutsche Telekom  DTK.CN and French Telecom.
MCI's heavy investment in media, Internet and satellite services with News Corp Ltd is not expected to break even for several years.
""The dilutive effects of the MCI ventures will increase year over year,"" Massick said.  
AT&amp;T said on September 24 that earnings per share could be as much as 10 percent below analysts' forecasts of $0.92 per share for the third quarter.  If this fear were realized, it would report earnings of $0.83, 13.5 percent below the $0.96 of a year earlier.
Analysts say AT&amp;T's problems were an expensive and flawed consumer market strategy of trying to win customers by offering them $100 checks and the competitive effect of small, fast-growing resellers and ""dial around"" services.  
Resellers include companies like Excel Communications Inc, which have produced 50 percent-plus annual revenue growth by using independent sales representatives to sell to friends, family and associates.
Dial around is so named because customers use a 1-800 number to access a rival service advertising cut price rates for long distance or international calling, without switching their long distance provider.
The long distance giants do not lose the customer, but notice a fall in average billable revenue.  
MCI expects higher customer turnover in consumer markets because of increased competition. But neither it nor Sprint depends as heavily on the consumer market as AT&amp;T does.
Merrill Lynch analyst Dan Reingold said in a research report that demand demand for Sprint's services is robust.
""Our forecast minute (of use) growth rate of 9.1 percent should be almost double the industry average...indicating that Sprint continues to take market share,"" Reingold said.
By contrast he expected AT&amp;T minutes of use to grow by 6.2 percent from a year ago, and revenue on this to rise just 1.5 percent.
This growth gap of 4.7 percentage points would exceed the 3.4 percent of the second quarter, he said.
Analysts say Sprint and MCI are not immune to the threat from dial around and resellers, but in any case the threat will be contained in the next two or three years.
""I think the idea of packages or bundles of services will be very much a threat to the small dial around competition because they won't be able to compete up and down the product chain,"" said Guy Woodlief of brokers Dean Witter Reynolds.  
AT&amp;T's adoption of a flat rate 15 cent long distance charge should help it regain market share, especially against Sprint, which charges a flat 25 cents during the day.
Such is the danger is adopting a clear pricing policy -- when more than one major competitor does it comparisons become easy and can lead to a downward spiral in calling charges.
""Given AT&amp;T's brand position in the market place, it is going to remain a formidable competitor,"" said Woodlief. Company   (all in dollars)    Q3 est   yr ago  results date

7,"AT&amp;T Corp chairman and chief executive Robert Allen will step down early as the price of attracting a talented enough successor to take over, sources close to the company said on Friday.
The sources said that whoever is chosen to succeed Alex Mandl, who quit in August as president and chief operating officer, would expect to be able to succeed Allen, 61, well before the four years still to run on his contract.
""I think it is fair to assume that,"" said one source, declining to be identified.  
AT&amp;T would not comment on the search for Mandl's successor and whether the candidate would succeed Allen.
""The search by the board is a private matter and we won't comment beyond that,"" said AT&amp;T spokesman Jim Byrnes.
Analysts say one possibility is that Allen would split out the role of chief executive to the new candidate in a year or so but retain his chairmanship until retirement.
""I expect the (AT&amp;T) system would allow and wish Allen to stay on in a senior official position for some time,"" said Mark Bruneau of consultant COBA MID.  
An ambitious candidate would wantct on the strategic direction of AT&amp;T, one source said, noting he fast-changing telecommunications market may be barely recognizable in ars.
The sources declined to comment on who the candidates might be, but many aired in the media already seem to have ruled themselves out.
""There is probably more speculation out there than truth in the media at this juncture (on who the candidates are),"" said one of the sources.  
The AT&amp;T board meets next Wednesday, a day before its third quarter results, and may discuss the issue then.
Allen, a 40-year AT&amp;T career veteran, would be reluctant to depart early, but in a recent press interview said he would consider it if a perfect candidate came along.
AT&amp;T has hired executive search groups Korn Ferry and Spencer Stuart to look for an outside candidate, but officials at the firms declined to comment on the process.  
Two candidates mentioned by the New York Times on Friday virtually ruled themselves out. William Esry, chairman of long distance telephone company Sprint Corp, said through a spokesman he was unaware of being on any AT&amp;T candidate list.
""His contract with Sprint precludes working with competitors for several years after he leaves the company,"" the Sprint spokesman added.
Similarly, Hughes Electronics Corp said president Michael Armstrong was unaware of being an AT&amp;T candidate.  
The Wall Street Journal reported that Eastman Kodak Co chairman George Fisher and former AT&amp;T director James Barksdale, who is chairman of Netscape Communications Corp, also ruled themselves out of the speculation.
Expectations of an earlier end to Allen's career have been fanned by AT&amp;T's profit warning in September, in which it said earnings per share for the third quarter may be 10 percent below analysts' expectations.

42,"Computer network company 3Com Corp. will acquire modem giant U.S. Robotics in a deal valued at $6.6 billion, the companies said Wednesday, in a deal that would create a counterweight to industry powerhouse Cisco Systems Inc.
The merger -- the largest ever in the computer network industry -- will create a company with more than $5 billion in annual revenues and more than 12,000 employees in 130 countries, U.S. Robotics and 3Com said.
Under terms of the deal announced after markets closed, each share of U.S. Robotics will be swapped for 1.75 shares of 3Com. The deal is valued at $6.6 billion based on the $39.125 Tuesday closing price of 3Com stock, the companies said.
3Com closed Wednesday down 12.5 cents at $39 and U.S. Robotics was down 50 cents at $61, both on Nasdaq.
The companies said the merger would create a company that would provide end-to-end equipment for computer networks.
U.S. Robotics, based in Skokie, Ill., is the world's largest maker of consumer modems, which enable personal computer users to connect to the Internet and online services and to send and receive faxes from their PCs. Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com is one of the biggest computer networking companies.
Industry analysts were divided over whether the merger of two of the top six network equipment suppliers would be enough to offer one-stop shopping for network equipment on the scale of No. 1 company Cisco Systems Inc.
""No more 'Cisco and the Seven Dwarfs',"" Bear, Stearns analyst Eric Blachno said, invoking a nickname frequently heard in the industry to describe Cisco's dominant position. ""It appears the Cisco has acquired a large competitor.""
Veteran industy analyst Frank Dzubeck, however, questioned the viability of combining the two companies in light of precedents set by previous mega-mergers in the industry.
""This could be another Bay-Wellfleet-Synoptics deal,"" he said, referring to the 1994 merger that formed Bay Networks Inc. That merger ran into problems over conflicts in combining product lines, company cultures and management teams, analysts have said.
The U.S. Robotics-3Com deal calls for 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou to remain chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. U.S. Robotics Chairman and Chief Executive Casey Cowell will join 3Com's board as vice chairman.
""The combination of 3Com and U.S. Robotics dramatically alters the networking landscape with the industry's broadest set of innovative, feature-rich network access solutions,"" said Benhamou. ""Together, with an installed base of over 100 million network connections, we can offer network users the fastest access to their local and wide area networks.
Cowell said, ""By providing faster, more intelligent, and easier-to-use products for connecting the broadest array of users to local and wide area networks, we can accelerate the deployment of networking worldwide.""
The merger, which is subject to approval by government regulators and shareholders, is expected to close this summer and is expected to result in a one-time charge against earnings in that quarter.
The deal is also expected to be slightly dilutive to the combined companies' earnings, but that will be offset by expected cost savings from the merger, 3Com Chief Financial Officer Chris Paisley said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.
The deal could revitalise interest in networking stocks, which have met with stiff selling pressure in the wake of earnings and sales warnings from several companies in recent weeks, Prime Charter Ltd. Chief Investment Strategist Scott Bleier said.
""This should heat up the networking sector,"" Bleier said. ""This is a mega-merger and you can probably expect other big companies like Cisco and Ascend (Communications Corp.) are going to be on the prowl.""
According to Instinet, several networking shares traded higher in after-hours activity. Cascade Communications Corp. rose to $33 from a regular session closing price of $32.625, and Cisco Systems Inc. traded at $58.50, up from a close of $58.125.
"
42,"MCI Communications Corp. said Monday it reached a 10-year deal with NextWave Telecom Inc. that thrusts MCI into the top tier of U.S. wireless communications providers.
Under terms of the deal, MCI said it will connect its network to a system planned by NextWave to provide personal communications services, giving it the capacity to offer service to more than 110 million individuals in 63 areas, including 29 of the top 50 markets.
Washington-based MCI said it will buy at least 10 billion minutes of capacity for its personal communications services from NextWave over 10 years. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Personal communications services represent the new generation of celluar communications services, allowing customers to send both voice and data transmissions over wireless telephones.
The deal will help underpin the financial future of debt-laden NextWave, which was the largest bidder in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auctions for ""C-band"" wireless radio spectrum held in early July.
NextWave, based in San Diego and New York, also plans to sell stock to the public.
For MCI, the deal enables it to expand quickly into the rapidly growing market for wireless personal communications services.
Two years ago, MCI dropped out of the auctions for U.S. PCS licences after the bidding became too rich for its taste.
But with the NextWave pact and previous smaller deals, MCI has moved to become a major reseller of wireless services.
As part of the deal, NextWave selected MCI to provide telecommunications and other services supporting the development and ongoing operations of its personal communications services system, MCI said.
""This agreement with NextWave establishes an immediate nationwide PCS footprint for MCI and represents an important next step in MCI's wireless strategy,"" said Whitey Bluestein, vice president for MCI wireless strategy and development.
""This is the first full interconnection agreement of its kind and brings new competition to the wireless marketplace,"" he said, noting that with full interconnection, MCI does not need to own its own wireless facilities.
MCI said the NextWave agreement is a model for additional agreements it expects to sign with other wireless providers as part of its wireless interconnected network strategy.
The strategy is MCI's blueprint for developing a full range of wireless services and features that will be integrated into MCI's existing communications services.
""This was MCI's strategy all along,"" said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications industry analyst.
Kagan said MCI has historically preferred to resell communications services initially rather than investing in its own infrastructure. Over time, the company selectively builds its own infrastructure as it proves profitable to do so.
""Reselling service was how they became a heavy hitter in long distance in the first place,"" Kagan said. ""What their plan is, is to resell service from other providers and build networks where they see the need to do so,"" he said.
Kagan said MCI's deal with NextWave marks the rapid realisation of its reseller strategy. ""This all of a sudden puts MCI on the wireless communications map in a big way.""
Still, he noted that AT&amp;T Corp.'s AT&amp;T Wireless unit, the former McCaw Cellular business, remains twice as large as MCI's cellular business, with about 6.5 million subscribers in geographic regions covering 207 million potential customers.
MCI's deal with NextWave covers about 110 million potential customers living in a mix of metropolitan and less-densely populated areas.
MCI's stock traded at $25.25 a share Monday, down 25 cents, on Nasdaq.

42,"WavePhore Inc., an Arizona company specializing in wireless data transmission, unveiled plans Monday for a service that would use existing television signals to broadcast programming to personal computers.
The proposed system, called WaveTop, will allow computer users to bypass bottlenecks in the Internet by enabling them to receive programs broadcast by WavePhore, the company said.
The Phoenix-based company said it expected to begin selling its WaveTop service in September.
The WaveTop service will broadcast entertainment and information programming nationwide over TV signals, sidestepping the clogged phone lines and overstrained computer networks that slow Internet connections, the company said.
""We think we can complement the Internet beautifully,"" said Sandy Goldman, vice president of WavePhore's consumer unit.
Analysts consider the system one of a promising new breed of products designed to take advantage of the convergence of personal computers and television technology.
The category includes products like WebTV, which differs from WavePhore in that it relies on a phone line and special TV set-top box to provide Internet connections to TV sets.
WaveTop will initially broadcast stereo music, news, educational childrens programs and new software to home PCs, without interrupting tasks being performed by the computer, the company said.
Once it begins U.S. operations in September, WaveTop will be the first wireless data broadcast medium to deliver audio, video, software and real-time data to home personal computers, Goldman said in an interview Friday.
""This gets past the bottleneck of the phone line being busy,"" said Gary Arlen, a veteran online industry analyst who heads Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.
The system will be free to consumers who own a broadcast-ready personal computer equipped with a TV tuner, a device that several top computer manufacturers plan to include in new machines this year. TV tuners add about $99 to $150 to the cost of a PC, but prices are falling.
WaveTop would be advertiser-supported but also may offer a pay-per-use option.
Arlen said the system was well suited for transmitting information that did not require instant feedback. ""For a lot of Web surfing, all you need is a way of quickly accessing things that are floating through the wires anyway,"" he said.
The WaveTop system operates by embedding data into a portion of existing TV signals. WavePhore has announced a pact to use the Public Broadcasting Service's 250 local stations to broadcast via an unused portion of their signals.
The high-speed service will be able to reach more than 99 percent of U.S. television households simultaneously and could eventually be extended to cover Canada over the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s TV network.
""It's a network infrastructure that's already in place,"" said Joel Krasner of brokerage firm Southcoast Capital, the one Wall Street analyst who formally follows the company.
""You don't have to have people using cable modems or fiber optic cables,"" said Krasner, referring  to other, more costly methods of speeding Internet delivery using phone and cable television technologies.
While WavePhore officials said the company planned to launch an aggressive promotional campaign aimed at the Christmas 1997 selling season, Krasner expected WaveTop to take root only among so-called early adopters this year.
""It's a 1998 event,"" Krasner said of chances WaveTop could become a hit consumer electronics product.
Goldman said the WaveTop network planned to offer one radio station in 1997 and three by 1998, playing a choice of rock, classical and jazz music.
KidsTop, aimed at children, will deliver educational programming developed by PBS and others, Goldman said.
For news, Goldman said the company hoped to negotiate deals with media companies like Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. or Reuters Holdings Plc to offer a slimmed-down version of what WavePhore already offers on its professional investor network.
He said WavePhore has few information partnerships to announce, but was in talks with content providers for each of the seven services WaveTop will offer. Goldman said the company expected to sign these deals ahead of the service's September launch.
The company noted that a recent study by technology research firm Yankee Group estimated that by the year 2000, nearly 20 million U.S. households will have PCs capable of receiving data embedded in a TV signal.
WavePhore's strategy has been embraced by computer industry leaders Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which are developing enabling technology of their own to support the integration of home computer and TV technologies.
WavePhore stock rose 12.5 cents to $9 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

42,"Computer distribution powerhouse Ingram Micro Inc. is set to hold its widely anticipated initial public offering on Wall Street Thursday despite some last-minute delays, including management changes.
""We haven't seen anything comparable in the technology sector with its kind of name this year,"" said Manish Shah, editor and publisher of the IPO Maven, of the new issue.
Anticipating heavy demand, the estimated price on Ingram's 20 million share offering was boosted to $17 to $19 a share Wednesday from $14 to $16, said underwriter Morgan Stanley.  
As the world's leading distributor of computer hardware, software and networking equipment to corporate resellers and computer retailers, Santa Ana, Calif.-based Ingram is a veritable steam-engine of computer industry growth.
There are really only three world-class distributors of computer products: Ingram, with revenues expected to hit roughly $10 billion this year, Merisel Inc. with $6 billion and Tech Data Corp. at $4 billion.  
That size advantage is crucial said Seymour Merrin, a leading industry analyst, who heads Merrin Information Services Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif. ""Market share isn't just an important factor,"" Merrin said. ""It's the only factor.""
Ingram's suppliers read like a Who's Who of the leading computer brands -- names like IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Novell and U.S. Robotics. And like many of those names, Ingram is seen as the undisputed leader in its own industry.
Its main customers are not end-users of technology products, but the middlemen of distribution -- corporate resellers, systems intergrators and computer retailers.  
""Ingram's got it all: distribution power, brand quality and customer or franchise loyalty,"" Shah said.
Underlying excitement about the new stock is a belief that Ingram is positioned to benefit directly from a multi-year computer buying boom expected to take hold later this year or early in 1997 and last for anywhere from two to four years.
Companies are preparing to upgrade to faster Intel Pentium PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and buy a host of related products made passible by the more powerful machines.  
In one important respect, however, Ingram should not be classified with other top technology names famous for their explosive earnings growth and spiraling stock prices.
Ingram competes in a brutal low-margin business that has more in common with supermarkets or trucking than computers -- its profit margins have in fact declined to 6.8 percent in the first half of 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1993.
The company's path to Wall Street has not been without its detours and mishaps.  
An anticipated public offering was temporarily derailed earlier in the year when Linwood ""Chip"" Lacy -- the engineer credited with driving Ingram Micro's growth over the years -- resigned as chairman and chief executive.
Ingram located a prominent replacement in Jerre Stead, the former head of mainframe software maker Legent Corp. until its 1995 acqusition by Computer Associates International Inc. It named Michael Grainger chief finacial officer two weeks ago.
But any Ingram doubters will remain on the sidelines Thursday.  
""It is definitely one of the best offerings of the year. There is great demand,"" said Shah for shares of the stock. ""I think it will remain strong and by the end of year, it could be a $30 stock,"" he added.  
In an industry known for its love of jargon, computer business insiders speak with a mix of reverential awe about ""the Channel"" - short for distribution channel and the delivery mechanism that has make-or-break control over the future of any computer product.
Ingram is to ""the Channel"" what Microsoft is to software, Intel is to microprocessors and Cisco is to networking.

42,"Bell Atlantic Corp. said Thursday its earnings rose sharply in the first quarter, boosted by growth in its telephone and cellular businesses.
The Philadelphia-based telecommunications company reported first-quarter net income of $515.6 million, an increase of 11.0 percent over the $464.7 million it earned in first quarter of 1996. Earnings per share rose to $1.17 from $1.06, slightly more than the First Call consensus estimate of $1.16.
Operating revenues grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion.
""This was a good solid set of numbers,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Simon Flannery said of the strong showing in new and second-line growth, wireless business and productivity.
""In spite of investments for new initiatives, they were still able to deliver double-digit earnings growth in the latest quarter,"" he said.
Bell Atlantic Chairman and Chief Executive Raymond Smith said, ""Demand for our services, including data connectivity, wireless and value-added services, continues to drive excellent bottom line performance.""
Anticipating a landmark year for the company, Smith said, ""We are heading toward the closing of our merger with Nynex with great momentum. With solid fundamentals, we are poised for a terrific year in 1997.""
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Bell Atlantic and Nynex Corp. are stepping preparations for a legal counter-attack if the Justice Department blocks their proposed $23 billion merger, which was announced in April 1996.
Smith said the company has been able to absorb significant start-up costs for new ventures, such as the PrimeCo personal communications services partnership and international wireless activities.
The chief factors in the latest results were continued cost-control measures and the strong performance of Bell Atlantic's core business units, driven by revenue growth of 7.6 percent, including Bell Atlantic's proportionate share of domestic cellular revenues.
The year-ago results excluded a non-cash $142.1 million charge the comnpany took to cover a change in the method for booking revenues from its directory publishing business in 1996. After the restatement, first-quarter 1996 net income was $606.8 million, but investors focused on the company's actual operating results.
Bell Atlantic's stock gained $1 to $60.25 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The latest earnings report consolidates the results of the Mexican Grupo Iusacell SA de CV investment for the first time following Bell Atlantic's assumption of operational control of the business in February. Specific figures were not broken out in the company's statement.

42,"Shares of network stocks fell on Thursday amid fears that 3Com Corp's merger with U.S. Robotics Corp would heap new burdens on an industry already struggling with a raft of near-term issues.
Analysts said the $7.3 billion merger plan boosted pressure on other network players to use their discounted shares as currency to fund major acquisitions of their own.
Some said 3Com's $7.3 billion offer for U.S. Robotics stock and options put a low-ball valuation on the modem maker of 20 times 1997 earnings, versus a historic 25 times multiple.  
""If anything this deal is more of a take-under than a takeover,"" Salomon analyst Peter Swartz said of the 3Com deal.
""This deal says the days of the 35 to 40 percent premiums paid in previous networking acquisitions are over,"" Swartz said, noting many stocks were now trading at historic lows.
""Both stocks are down 50 percent from their highs,"" he pointed out.
By midafternoon, U.S. Robotics shares were up 1/4 at 61-1/4, well below the 68-1/4 contemplated by the terms of 3Com's merger offer. 3Com stock was off 3-1/2 points at 35-1/2.  
Donaldson Lufkin analyst Eric Buck harshly criticized the terms of the deal. ""I think U.S. Robotics shareholders are being robbed,"" he said.
In the wake of the deal, industry leader Cisco Systems Inc was down 2-1/8 to 56, Ascend Communications Inc lost 4-3/8 points to 58 and Cascade Communications Corp was down 2-1/8 to 30-1/2.
""We believe the competitive landscape of the networking sector is undergoing a fundamental restructuring,"" J.P. Morgan's Bill Rabin said in published comments. ""Other networking vendors will have to combine or be bought.""  
Still, Rabin reiterated buy ratings on four stocks in the sector, while maintaining his market perform rating on 3Com. Swartz also kept his buy rating on 3Com shares, and recommended investors take advantage of price weakness.
The main beneficiaries of the 3Com-Robotics deal appeared to be Bay Networks Inc and Shiva Corp -- two stocks that have sat in the doghouse for some time -- based on their potential as acqusition targets, analysts said.
Shiva rose 9/16 to 15-13/16, recovering from its historic low, while Bay added 1/8 to 19-3/8.  
In comments to his sales force, Merrill analyst Joe Bellace said Shiva, among other remote access suppliers, may be a more likely acquisition target over the next two years in light of the 3Com-Robotics deal, market sources said.
""The merger forces other players in the industry to ante up to play in this bigger game,"" said Steve Harmon, an independent analyst who publishes the Internet Stock Report.
""It forces equipment makers to look for end-to-end solutions supplying network products to both businesses and consumers,"" he said of how the 3Com-Robotics merger would allow the combined company to compete in both markets.  
Strong break-up penalties the 3Com-Robotics deal would levy if either party backs out, makes it unlikely another suitor will arise with a sweeter offer, analysts said.
Earnings shortfalls, or close calls, fears of slowing industry growth, and cautionary comments from 3Com, Cascade and Shiva have excited fears about the whole sector, Rabin said.
In addition, technology changes in the industry and the growing threat of competition from outsiders such as chip makers Intel Corp and Rockwell International Corp have weighed down the prospects for the industry as a whole.
Some analysts cited fears that Intel may decide to integrate network adapter cards or modem chips directly into the computer chassis its builds, rendering stand-alone products from many network suppliers a commodity, if not obsolete.

42,"Texas Instruments Inc. said Tuesday it set a licensing pact with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. of Korea that will generate royalty payments of more than $1 billion over 10 years.
In exchange, each side agreed to drop pending patent infringement lawsuits against each other.
The agreement replaces a previous five-year deal that expired at the end of 1995, the Dallas-based maker of computer chips, notebook computers and other electronics products said.
While the deal reassured some Wall Street analysts who were not already counting on additional earnings from the settlement, others noted the terms appeared to be far less generous than one with Samsung in 1995.
""Texas Instruments appears willing to take a lower number to get the suits dropped against them,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak said.
""Our assessment is that the agreement is at roughly 40 to 50 percent of the rate of the old agreement,"" Kurlak said of the royalty formula Samsung will use to pay Texas Instruments.
The new license, which runs until the end of 2005, covers a broad base of patents from both companies, including those for semiconductors, personal computers, consumer products and telecommunications equipment, Texas Instruments said.
""We are pleased with this agreement and the value it places on our patented technology,"" said Richard Agnich, a senior vice president and general counsel at Dallas-based Texas Instruments.
The company in 1985 started to more aggressively defend alleged unauthorised use of its technology in a bid to improve the value of its intellectual property within the semiconductor industry. In the intervening decade, the company has won billions of dollars in additional royalties, a spokesman said.
Texas Instruments said it expected Samsung to pay it about $105 million in the fourth quarter for ""catch-up royalties"" covering the first nine months of 1996 when the companies were battling in court.
Analysts said the ""catch up"" payments should substantially boost earnings for the quarter ending in December, but the gain will be offset by a charge for an undisclosed amount the company plans to take for an early retirmement programme.
Kurlak estimated Texas Instruments will see $35 million in additional quarterly royalties going forward as a result of the Samsung deal, but that is down from the roughly $85 million it received quarterly from Samsung at the end of 1995.
With this deal, Texas Instruments said it has almost completed its 1995 round of patent cross-license agreements with major semiconductor makers.
Earlier in the year, Texas Instruments reached 10-year deals with Fujitsu Ltd., Oki Electric Industry Co. Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.
It said talks continue with NEC Corp. and several smaller producers.
The royalty payments will bolster Texas Instruments's net income, and allow it to focus on more profitable lines of business, analysts said.
Texas Instrument stock jumped $4.375 to $60.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

42,"Battling competition in its core long-distance phone business, a need to enter new markets and a looming management transition, AT&amp;T Corp. faces an even broader challenge in the proposed merger of British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Inc., two of its biggest adversaries.
British Telecom announced Sunday it planned to acquire the remaining 80 percent of MCI it does not already own in a complicated cash and stock transaction that values MCI at more than $20 billion.
AT&amp;T responded to news of the huge cross-border deal by calling on U.S. and European regulators to condition approval of it on a further freeing of competition in British Telecom's home market in the United Kingdom, even as British Telecom argued that it was already among the world's most open.
The merger would bring together the aggressive marketing skills of MCI -- the No. 2 U.S. long distance provider behind AT&amp;T -- with the deep pockets of the former British phone monopoly to form Concert, a combined entity with unprecedented global reach.
Analysts said the merger increases British Telecom's and MCI's scope for global pooling of resources and strategy coordination and puts pressure on AT&amp;T to beef-up its international strategies even as it must contend with an array of distractions at home.
""AT&amp;T is the one with the most to lose,"" said Forrester Research industry analyst David Goodtree. ""The company is in danger of becoming just another player,"" he said, noting how rivals large and small have begun to erode AT&amp;T's long-held dominance of the U.S. long-distance business.
The former U.S. phone monopoly has seen its share of the country's $75 billion long-distance market slip to under 55 percent from 60 percent two years ago.
""This deal really forces AT&amp;T to respond and unfold its strategy,"" said Berge Ayvazian, senior telecoms analyst with Yankee Group in Boston.
With British Telecom's financial backing, MCI is expected to step up its attack on the $90 billion local U.S. phone market, Ayvazian said. MCI already plows nearly $1 billion a year into the fiber optic networks that will allow its MCI Metro unit to supply local phone service in roughly half the United States.
AT&amp;T has been groping for a strategy to enter the U.S. market for local telephone services, even as another set of rivals, the regional Bell companies like Bell Atlantic/NYNEX Corp. and SBC/Pacific Telesis Group seek permission to enter the long-distance business.
""AT&amp;T must now find some counterpoint to the BT-MCI strategy by trying to open up and reveal its local plans,"" Ayvazian said.
""The company has become more and more isolated as the Bell companies prepare to enter the long-distance market and as AT&amp;T still relies on a go-it-alone strategy,"" agreed David Roddy, chief telecommunications economist at the Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting Group.
The proposed merger of BT and MCI is just the latest in a succession of threats to AT&amp;T's status as a global telecommunications carrier and its leadership of the U.S. phone business.
In September, AT&amp;T shocked Wall Street by warning that its second-half earnings would be dampened by continuing pressures in its long-distance business and efforts to gear up to offer local phone service in most of the 50 states. AT&amp;T also said its near-term earnings were being hurt by investments in new online and wireless services.
The decline in its financial results comes on the heels of AT&amp;T's year-long split-up of the company into three separate pieces, a move widely praised as necessary but one which nonetheless appears to have been a major distraction to its management. AT&amp;T recently completed the spin-off of Lucent Technologies Inc., its former telecom equipment arm, and is planning to spin off its NCR computer operation in coming months.
The break-up of AT&amp;T  has heightened dependence on its imperiled long-distance phone revenues. Responding to mounting concerns about AT&amp;T Chairman Robert Allen's leadership, the company recently named printing industry executive John Walter as its new president and chief operating officer and Allen's eventual successor after an 18-month transition.
Wall Street securities analysts have questioned the choice of Walter, an outsider to the telecommunications industry, while simultaneously criticizing the delay in handing over responsibility to him. Even those who praise Walter's track record as chief executive at R.R. Donnelley -- where he successfully engineered a complex transformation of the old line catalog printer into marketer of digital printing services -- said Walter faces a daunting learning curve at AT&amp;T.
BT still controls the lion's share of the British telephone market, with its grip on local service still amounting to 90 percent. But recent deregulation of the local service market has allowed rivals, including AT&amp;T through its AT&amp;T U.K. operation, to begin competing on BT turf.

42,"Semiconductor equipment stocks surged Friday on fresh signs the downturn in the chip industry has hit bottom, and the buying spilled over into some computer chip makers as well.
Investors jumped in after the leading maker of equipment used to produce computer chips, Applied Materials Inc., gave support to the growing consensus in the industry that the market for chip-making machinery would turn up in 1997.
Applied Materials on Thursday reported lower earnings for the latest quarter but also said that even at the low point in the current technology spending cycle, it expected profit margins to stay higher than in prior downturns.
That was enough for investors to rush in, even while the industry's profits have yet to start a meaningful rebound. Semiconductor equipment stocks are often seen by investors as bellwethers for the next wave of technology growth.
""Now we have an indication out of Applied Materials that the bottom is not as deep as some may have worried or suggested,"" said Deutsche Morgan analyst Elliott Rogers, who was one of several analysts to raise Applied to ""buy"" from ""hold"" Friday.
Applied Materials stock surged $6.625 to $38.625 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue with more than 21 million shares traded.
In addition to Applied Materials, KLA Instruments Corp. rallied $5 to $38.25, Tencor Instruments rose $5.50 to $26.75, and Lam Research Corp. increased $4.625 to $34.125.
The four equipment stocks were among Nasdaq's 10 most active, while Intel Corp., the world's biggest chip maker, rose $3.125 to $122.
Other chip equipment makers also rose, including PRI Automation Inc., up $6.375 to $42.875, and Novellus Systems Inc., up $8 to $57.875.
After the market closed Thursday, Applied Materials said profits fell 53 percent to $73.1 million, or 40 cents a share, for its fourth fiscal quarter, which was about in line with expectations.
But Wall Street analysts widely believe a new chapter has begun to unfold for the chip industry, which could lead to a rebound in orders for production equipment.
The recovery is expected since sales of personal computers appear to be picking up, which means renewed demand for additional chip-making equipment cannot far behind. PCs soak up about half of all semiconductors produced worldwide.
The chip industry over the years has become notorious for its boom-to-bust cycles. Many now argue that the latest year-long slow-down in semiconductor equipment spending has stabilised, leaving the industry poised to begin another of its cyclical upturns early next year.
This could come even after chip makers aggressively built plants and added capacity last year, which flooded the market and led to a glut of chip inventory earlier this year.
Alex. Brown analyst Byron Walker said that during a conference call Thursday, Applied Materials executives said they saw equipment order rates stabilising.
But while Walker upgraded Applied Materials and other stocks in the group, he cautioned the companies might be hurt next year by a continued glut of computer memory chips, the biggest category of semiconductors.

42,"H&amp;R Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service industry, said Wednesday it has decided not to complete the spin-off of the rest of its CompuServe online unit, at least for now.
The Kansas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CompuServe after spinning off part of the online service earlier this year, cited CompuServe's recent financial troubles and uncertainties facing the online industry.
Industry analysts said the problems reflect the changes rippling through the online industry but were also partly unique to Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has about 5.2 million subscribers, slightly more than half of them outside of the United States.
America Online Inc., the largest with more than 6 million subscribers, No. 2 Compuserve and Prodigy have all been hurt as users have gone directly to the Internet with lower-cost Internet access providers rather than online services.
Some analysts have said that the online services, which offer packages of specialised information as well as Internet access, may not survive in the long run, though the eventual shape of the online industry remains far from certain.
""A lot of the people are going to read this as the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky,"" said one analyst who follows the industry.
H&amp;R Block spun off 20 percent of CompuServe in April and had planned to distribute the rest to its shareholders.
But it said Wednesday that it has decided not to present the proposed spin-off of the rest of CompuServe to shareholders at its annual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11.
""The board continues to believe that a separation of CompuServe is in the best interests of H&amp;R Block shareholders and will continue to consider the matter,"" H&amp;R Block interim President Frank Salizzoni said.
CompuServe's stock has dropped from a high of $35.50 on its first day of trading to near $10 recently. The stock rose after Wednesday's announcement because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&amp;R Block will not come onto the market.
CompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&amp;R Block fell $2.125 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also on Nasdaq.
In July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publicly traded company.
The company blamed the high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new customers.
In response, CompuServe and H&amp;R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuit alleging they had misrepresented the online service's prospects in the prospectus for the stock offering.
When the company last week reported a first-quarter loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, it also warned investors that losses would continue for the second quarter ending in October.
H&amp;R Block, which is also the nation's largest consumer tax filing service, is likely to wait for the online industry to settle down before completing the spin-off, analysts said.
In addition to the losses, H&amp;R Block cited the planned introduction next month of new technology for CompuServe and its new Wow! service.
Meanwhile, America Online has had problems of its own, including price cuts to stay competitive with Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout earlier this month. But analysts said that in contrast to CompuServe, America Online has continued to grow, though at a slower pace.
""The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next nine months,"" one analyst said.

10,"Sun Microsystems Inc on Wednesday unveiled its first mainframe-class server, marking its entry into a $50 billion market for data-center computer hardware, storage, software and services.
Ed Zander, president of the company's Sun Microsystems Computer Co, said he expected the machines to sell for an average price of more than $1 million.  
Speaking to a a gathering of analysts, customers and reporters at San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art, Zander cautioned that the new Ultra Enterprise 10000 servers, which can compete with mainframe computers on many measurements of computing performance, would have a longer sales cycle than Sun's more traditional Unix product lines.
Still, he said Sun expected to sell more of its speedy Ultra Enterprise 5000 and 6000 midrange servers as a result of its new high-end machine, which is available immediately to launch customers. It will begin shipping in volume in March.  
""It really puts Sun into some new markets where they have not been able to play before,"" said C.B. Lee, senior analyst at Sutro &amp; Co.
Lee said the new server would be most useful for running complex database applications and for extending new computing capabilities, rather than replacing older software and hardware that have come to be known as legacy systems.  
Montgomery Securities analyst Kurt King said by extending Sun's capabilities at the high end, the new machines may help overall investor sentiment by allaying somewhat the fears of competition at the lower end of Sun's product line from PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Windows.
""It expands Sun's business,"" he said, adding it would inevitably help boost margins and help move the mix toward servers and away from the Unix workstation market. Sun dominates that market but Intel and Windows NT are challenging its lead.
The base Starfire configuration -- 16 processors and two gigabytes of memory -- will be priced around $870,000.  
Sun officials declined to comment specifically on margin and revenue or earnings expectations, although John Shoemaker, who heads Sun's enterprise server and storage group, repeated that Sun aimed to become the leading midrange server supplier.
It is currently third behind International Business Machines Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co, analysts said. Shoemaker said Sun estimated its rate of growth to be two to three times that of its archrivals, however.
""We think we have a realistic objective in about three years to be number one,"" he said. ""We are significantly gaining share on our competitors.""  
Sun said its 10000 series, codenamed 'Starfire', offers up to four times the performance of IBM's CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) mainframe and HP T-series servers.
Zander said the company's sales force would market the machines aggressively. ""This is a hunk of Iron,"" he said after the machine was brought onto stage using a turntable. ""Bring back the old days -- gross margin, revenue,"" he said.
Because it runs Sun's Solaris version of Unix, the 10000 series also can run 12,000 Solaris-based applications.
Shares of Sun fell 68 cents to $32.75 in Nasdaq trade.  
Sun also announced storage products, including its RSM Array 2000, which supports up to 20 terabytes for the 10000. It will begin shipping in February for Solaris servers.
The RSM Array 2000 is priced at $0.49 per megabyte, sharply lower than the $1.75 per megabyte and $1.08 per megabyte it said new EMC machines cost.
Sun said it would offer Veritas Software Corp's Veritas File System disk and information management system with its storage products, and it demonstrated it on the RSM Array 2000. Mountain View-based Veritas jumped $6.75 to $51.

10,"Netscape Communications Corp., said Tuesday its quarterly revenues hit a record $100 million in the third quarter, demonstrating the surging popularity of its Internet software among companies setting up internal networks known as intranets.
Netscape, which pioneered the popular Netscape Navigator browser software for cruising the Internet's World Wide Web, said its third quarter net income was $7.7 million, or 9 cents a share. A year ago, the fledgling company earned $175,000 on sales of $23.3 million.
""The third quarter of 1996 was another landmark quarter for Netscape, as Netscape server and client software solutions made significant inroads into the global enterprise market,"" said Netscape President and Chief Executive Jim Barksdale.
Wall Street, which had been expecting Netscape to report revenues of roughly $85 million to $90 million, had not expected the company to hit the $100 million quarterly revenue milestone until the second quarter next year, analysts said.
""I think the $100 million mark really shows significdant growth,"" said Hambrecht and Quist analyst Daniel Rimer, noting revenues grew 33 percent sequentially. ""This is major league revenue for a quarter.""
The quarterly revenue was well above the $80.7 million it posted for the whole of 1995. For the first nine months, Netscape earned $12 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $231 million. A year earlier, the company lost $7 million, or 10 cents a share, on sales of $44 million.
In after-hours dealing, shares of Netscape were firm, changing hands as high as $44.875, up from its closing level of $44.50 in Nasdaq market trading.
Barksdale said in an interview after the results that the indirect sales through third parties such as computer makers and systems integrators had accounted for 60 percent of overall sales, and 100 percent in Europe and Asia.
""We think it's a very efficient channel for us,"" he said. ""More and more we're seeing our job as demand creation through our direct sales force. We just think it's a more efficient way for these kind of products (to be sold).""
""I'm very proud we have gotten to that as quickly, because we're very dependent on these people,"" he said.
Barksdale outlined a broad range of companies which had chosen Netscape software to build applications for their computer networks, or ""intranet"" applications, and said the company was moving towards sales of complete systems.
Analysts said this focus and the rapid growth of the market will help it continue to grow in competition with rivals like Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp's Lotus Development Corp.
Barksdale said he remains concerned that competitors will be confused by the competitive frenzy, although he said key Netscape products remain lower in price those of Microsoft and Lotus, for example.
Barksdale told analysts in a conference call that customers were using its Internet technology for a variety of functions, such as human resources administration, in addition to the order tracking feature for which it is known.
""What becomes clear is that people are not only deploying intranets, but they're expanding the utility of their intranets,"" Rimer said.

10,"The great Internet gold rush may be over, some high-technology industry executives say, but they see a silver lining: continued growth for leading high-tech companies.
""The Internet gold rush is over. We've had this big phenomenon, but there's not a lot of gold there,"" Frank Gill, executive vice president and general manager of Intel Corp.'s Internet and Communications Group, said in an interview on the eve of Wednesday's Spring Internet World 97 conference.
Gill is one of five keynote speakers at the Los Angeles conclave, which is expected to produce a blizzard of new product announcements from Internet start-up companies, many of them based in California's Silicon Valley.
In additon to Intel's Gill, top executives from computer makers Apple Computer Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. are expected to speak at the conference.
The Internet start-up explosion reached its peak nearly a year ago, when some Internet companies changed the rules of raising money in stock markets, where three years of profitability were considered a prerequisite for going public.
Yahoo! Inc., for example, went public at a valuation that peaked in initial trading at over $1 billion on its first day of trading despite less than a year of full operating history and no assurance of profits in the foreseeable future.
Despite the brakes applied to the Internet public offering market last summer, venture capital investment continues at a strong pace and major corporations are now going onto the World Wide Web, which continues to grow at a rapid clip.
Start-ups with innovative products -- including technology that ""pushes"" news and software content to users instead of making them go out and get it and so-called intelligent agents that help sift through the huge mass of data on the Internet -- are expected to flock to the conference floor hoping to flaunt their wares.
""I don't think the number of start-ups will slow down (but) their dreams for (stock) valuations will be more realistic,"" said Gill, who is due to address the conference Thursday.
Now people are ""hunkering down"" to focus on providing value to consumers and value to business, Gill said, adding that Intel itself has invested in smaller companies with pioneering technology and sought to foster new technologies, such as modems that run on cable televison systems and making telephone calls over the Internet.
Gill sees JamTV, a new online music network developed with Digital Entertainment Networks, as an example of new Internet capabilities which also drive demand for higher-performance computers.
For Intel, he said, the Internet is a ""wonderful opportunity"" because it could drive demand for more PC sales.
The Internet World conference will be the next battleground in the war between Internet pioneer Netscape Communications Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. for leadership in the Internet software market.
It also will give Apple Computer Chief Executive Gil Amelio another chance Wednesday to spell out his struggling company's Internet strategy, which he has said is core to its turnaround efforts, just two days before he is due to announce further layoffs in a fresh restructuring.
Whatever the plight of individual companies, industry executives at a conference held near San Francisco Tuesday said they saw no slowdown in Internet demand.
""We've seen over 300 percent growth in our backbone in 1996,"" said Robert Hagens, director of MCI Communications Corp.'s Network MCI Service, referring to the company's core Internet service lines.

10,"Netscape Communications Corp will on Monday map out a vision on how companies will be able to use its products in the future to coordinate activities between themselves and customers, partners, suppliers and distributors.
While much of the hype surrounding the advent of the World Wide Web has been devoted to new media opportunities, the area with the biggest payback involves a vast network of secured interconnections between companies using Internet technology.  
Internet analysts and investors in the technologies now expect the market for this variety of electronic commerce to far outstrip even their most upbeat projections for expansion of merchandising and advertising over the Web.
And for software providers such as Internet pioneer Netscape, the market could be even larger than the $10 billion that independent research firms are projecting the Intranet software market may grow to be by the year 2000.  
Marc Andreessen, Netscape's co-founder and senior vice president of technology, has been talking since the middle of last year about the prospective new market for these so-called ""Extranets"" -- external networks of interlinked corporate Intranets.
""Extranets could actually be bigger than Intranets. We'll see,"" Andreessen told Reuters. ""The reason is because if there's 10,000 Intranets out there, then there's 10,000 squared possible connections between them, every one of which is going to involve software.""  
""Right now, if a company wants to build an Extranet between two Intranets, they have to do a lot of work at the network level,"" Andreessen said.
With Netscape's software, companies can provide partners with access to parts of their Intranet, making it easier to communicate on projects, he said.
Netscape, which supplies the world's most popular Internet browser, hopes to develop what it calls ""Crossware"" -- on-demand software applications that run across a multitude of networks and operating systems.  
Netscape said its own next-generation products -- a client's software for computer users dubbed Mercury and a suite of server products codenamed Apollo -- will be available in early 1998.
The announcement is part of a flurry of product introductions expected this week at the industry's Internet World trade show in Los Angeles, and weeks before the final release of Netscape's Communicator package of Internet software, incorporating browsing, electronic mail and group collaboration features.  
Netscape also hopes its Actra Business Systems joint venture with a division of General Electric Co, will help build products for business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets.
Actra is releasing products before mid-year which will enable electronic data interchange over the Internet, Andreessen said.
In a bid to seed this new market, Andreessen said Netscape plans as early as this summer to release a new development tool codenamed Palomar to help developers build crossware applications.
For Netscape, the potential Extranet market could be a huge boon. It also promises to be no cakewalk, with rivals Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp's Lotus Development Corp reaching into their own deep pockets to compete aggressively in the field.
But Netscape hopes to continue to push its leadership role in Internet software and has lined up partnerships with more than 35 companies around a core set of standards for Extranets.

10,"Separate divisions of Hewlett-Packard Co. will Monday unveil new products executives say will reduce the difficulties and costs of owning and operating computer networks.
The products, which HP representatives said are geared to ease computing systems management while also reducing costs, include manageability tools and new additions to the company's HP Vectra line of business computers.  
The Palo Alto-based company is also launching a second generation of its HP NetServer E series server devices for small and medium-size businesses which typically have little or no computer systems management staff.
Computer servers are the machines which tie together networks of computers and other devices, such as printers and centralized data storage.
In an additional announcement, HP's printer division said it is adding to its HP OfficeJet ""all-in-one"" line of machines which combine in one device tasks such as printing, scanning, copying and fax capabilities.  
HP said its HP Vectra personal computer models will now come loaded with TopTOOLS, a new management tool provided free which enables systems managers to handle configuration, security and a variety of other tasks from any location on a computer network.
TopTOOLS is part of a series of enhancements HP is preparing in an effort to reduce the cost of operating networked personal computers, which some research studies have estimated can cost up to $12,000 a year to run.
The tool has a broad range of features, including the ability to remotely configure and upgrade systems, handle security features and keep an inventory of their PCs.  
HP said it will also provide a sweeping upgrade of its HP Vectra personal computer lines, including models equipped with Intel Corp.'s Pentium processors with MMX technology, enhanced 10/100 Base-T LAN interface and 4.5 gigabyte Ultra SCSI hard disk drives.
Its new high performance XA Pentium Pro processor HP Vectra PC models, for example, will begin at an average selling price of $2,624 for 200 Megahertz models, for example, or $3,583 with the Ultra SCSI drive.  
New models of the HP Vectra VL line will include a 64- bit graphics engine and new S3 Trio64 V2 video controller for enhanced graphics. The line in various configurations will range in price from $1,235 to $1,871, HP said.
The HP Vectra VA PCs will incorporate manageability features and have average prices of at $1,827 to $2,221 and the HP Vectra VE personal computers are to be value priced with expected prices in the $1,050 to $1,200 range.
HP also said it will launching the second generation of its NetServer E Series, the E40 model, just six months after it introduced the line last September.  
HP faces stiff competition from Compaq Computer Corp. in the space, but still reckons the top market competition is use of a generic personal computer tilted on its side and configured as a server.
For this reason, HP is adding features to make the E 40 models, priced at $2,160 to $2,630 and available on April 1, extremely simple to use for a company which may have no internal systems management staff.  
Elaine Lennox, worldwide E-Series product manager at HP's Network Server Division, said the machines include a simple alerting mechanism for problems and contain a remote console for resellers to fix problems remotely.
""We only tell you when there's a problem,"" said Lennox, adding each unit will be shipped with Novell Inc.'s IntranetWare for Small Business pre-installed so it can be activated using a key code if a customer wishes to add the network operating system.  
HP's printer business said it is launching its OfficeJet 500 printer-fax-copier-scanner which can print black text at speeds up to four pages a minute and color documents at a rate of a page a minute.
The new machine, expected to be available in May, are targeted at the small office, home office market and are expected to cost around $500 in the U.S. market.
HP said it will continue to sell its OfficeJet 300 for a reduced price, about $400 in the United States.  
HP is also introducing a professional multifunction printer, the OfficeJet Pro 1150C color printer-copier- scanner for about $1,000.
The product can print black text at speeds up to eight pages a minute and mixed text and color documents at speeds up to four pages a minute, with copy speeds only slightly slower. It can scan color images in 10 seconds.
HP is also introducing a 14-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) flat-panel PC monitor, which is expected to ship in April at an average U.S. selling price of $2,419.
The sleek monitors are more energy efficient than cathode ray tube devices and are particularly useful in areas where workspace is limited, HP said.

10,"Intel Corp. executives said late Tuesday the company has agreed to invest cash and technical know-how in a new company to deliver multimedia content by satellite to personal computers across Europe.
Intel said the investment, to be formally announced at the CeBIT technology trade fair in Hannover, Germany, on Wednesday, will be Intel's first investment in personal computer delivery services, although it has sought to foster other technologies that can help drive the use of personal computers worldwide.
Intel will hold a minority stake in the newly formed European Satellite Multimedia Services S.A. (ESM), said Leslie Vadasz, Intel senior vice president and director of corporate business development.
""Europe has a lot of satellite use, so it was an obvious place,"" to begin such a service, Vadasz told Reuters. ""There is a need to provide a new kind of service for PC users.""
Industry sources valued the Intel investment at $15 million, with Luxenbourg's Societe Europeenne des Satellite (SES) holding a majority stake in the new company, which will also be based in Luxenbourg.
Intel executives declined to comment on the cash value of the deal, but said the company would also be contributing technology to the endeavor, and hopes to bring in partners capable of supplying multimedia content to the venture.
""Part of our contribution will be technology. Part of it will be our relationship with many of our customers, content and media companies,"" Vadasz said in an interview.
Other investors are expected to be announced in the near future, he said. Negotiations with prospective investors aere under way, he said, but he declined to elaborate.
The new company will launch ASTRA-NET, a system for communications using SES's ASTRA satellite system already in place. The first business-to-business communications links will be operational in the second half of this year.
ESM is expected to eventually bring PC services to European homes much as increasingly popular satellite television services, like BSkyB, have done for TV.
Intel noted that more than 16 million personal computers bought in Europe last year, according to the research firm Dataquest, and 23 million European households have direct access to ASTRA satellite transmissions.
ASTRA-NET reception throughout Europe will require 50-60 centimeter satellite dish, less than two feet in diameter, connected to a PC equipped with a high-performance Intel Pentium microprocessor and a PC card which is compatible with Europe's Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) transmissions.
Intel said business data can be sent to servers at speeds up to 38 megabits per second, well above the 56 kilobit speeds of leading-edge telephone modems or the 128 kilobits per second rates of Integrated Digital Services Network (ISDN).
Speeds of six megabits per second to the home will be possible, with technology likely to be available by the year 2000 which could enable two-way satellite traffic.
At first, traffic will be broadcast-only, however, with the capcity to send data and multimedia programming at speeds hundreds of times faster than over conventional phones.
""As satellite technology moves along, there's be more and more opportunity to do an on-demand type of service,"" such as higher-speed Internet browsing. ""Initially, this will be a push technology only.""
Vadasz said Intel's work on developing technology for cable modems and on Ethernet local area network (LAN) adapters can be brought to bear in the project. Intel also has been working on a wireless data standard dubbed Intercast.
Vadasz has argued that PC communications have lagged wellbehind other technologies, stating in a recent editorial letter to the San Jose Mercury News that such services could result in more than $10 billion in annual U.S. sales alone.
To foster such a market, he wrote, higher bandwidth connections with instant access, multimedia integration, security and affordable pricing were necessary features.

The new line of Octane workstations fills out the broadest revamp ever of Silicon Graphics' product line. It includes a powerful new design aimed at bolstering its No. 3 position in the market for workstations running the Unix operating system.
The Mountain View, Calif.-based company discussed its new products in interviews ahead of Monday's formal release.
Silicon Graphics will also shave the prices of its Indigo2 Impact 10000 workstations by up to 22 percent as it aims to position the line between its entry-level O2 machines, introduced in October, and the new Octane models.
The powerful machines are typically used by engineers in intensive number-crunching tasks ranging from oil exploration and molecular modeling to flight simulation, computer-aided design and video and television.
The new Octanes share many of their components with the company's new supercomputing design unveiled in October and feature technology that greatly increases the speed with which data moves between its components.
""What SGI has done is eliminate most of the chokepoints, and you get the full effects of most of the microprocessor"" that is the heart of the computer, said David Weisberg, publisher of the newsletter Engineering Automation Report in Englewood, Colo.
Weisberg and industry analysts said such performance was important to Silicon Graphics' effort to fend off the threat to its traditional high-end graphics markets by increasingly powerful PCs built with Intel Corp. microprocessors running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system. Shipments of the computers based on what analysts have dubbed the ""Wintel"" PC architecture surpassed traditional workstations for the first time in 1996, according to preliminary data from International Data Corp.
The market research firm said Wintel-based systems grew 38 percent worldwide to 831,000 units. With revenues rising 16 percent to $3.7 billion while sales of traditional Unix workstations declined, International Data said it expects Windows NT-based systems to continue gaining share in 1997.
Weisberg said he was concerned that Silicon Graphics, along with Sun Microsystems Inc., has chosen to shun Windows NT and adapt a Unix-only approach despite the fact many newer software developers favor Windows NT.
""Silicon Graphics is, in effect, eliminating some of the very good software vendors,"" he said. ""If they don't make some type of a move to support Windows NT by the end of the year, 1998 could be a very difficult year for Silicon Graphics.""
Drew Henry, product line manager of Silicon Graphics' power desktop line, said that with the design used in its O2, Indigo2 and Octane systems, Silicon Graphics can ""sell levels of performance that are well above levels of performance that you're going to get out of a Wintel system.""
About half of the new Octanes, which Silicon Graphics plans to start shipping by the beginning of March, are expected to be sold through third parties, he said.
International Data analyst Karen Seymour said the Octane's new design, or architecture, would give it ""headroom"" for future high-end performance and help it gain market share. But she said it was not likely to challenge the position of first-place Sun Microsystems and No. 2 Hewlett-Packard Co..
""I think the most critical aspect of this announcement is going to be SGI's ability to execute,"" she said.
Silicon Graphics last week said delays in stepping up production of new computer models hurt financial performance in its December quarter despite strong demand for new products which pushed its orders to record levels.
Pricing for the Octane systems starts at $24,995, the company said.
The new prices for Indigo2 machines, which take effect Feb. 1 and include up to a 33 percent reduction in memory and storage upgrade prices, reduce the price of its lower-end Indigo2 Solid Impact to $19,995 from $24.995.

10,"While Internet stocks have taken center stage in the investment arena alongside such high-tech stalwarts as Intel Corp and Cisco Corp, many investors are wary about what 1997 will bring.
Tech sector stocks have sagged amid uncertainty over the 1997 market outlook.
With growth of the PC market expected to moderate further despite a strong business upgrade cycle, investment in technology stocks is shifting somewhat towards value investing from momentum players,  according to some investors and analysts at the annual Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. technology conference here.
""People are still suffering from too much money  and too much volatility and they're not sure when it's all going to stop,"" said Keith Benjamin, a Robertson Stephens senior research analyst covering Internet media content and services companies.
Investors also said they are being more selective than a year ago, when Internet stocks were the rage and bankers joked that you could write ""Internet"" on a dollar bill and take it public for $10.
""Investors are looking for stable revenue streams here, annuity-type businesses,"" said one investor for a European fund.
Some investors also expressed frustration at the process of sifting through myriad business plans -- some 70 of the more than 350 companies presenting here this week were Internet related, many taking the center stage over more established firms.
""I don't think they have any idea what their business plan is,"" said another investor, shaking his head as he left the room after a presentation of one well-known Internet startup.
""There are very few opportunities and so much money out there looking for them,"" said Robert Herwick, head of Herwick Capital Management, noting the recent sell-off in networking stocks could also have repercussions for shares of hot chip-makers supplying the communications market.
Many of these fast-growing companies had held their value last year despite the slump in the rest of the semiconductor sales at the time amid a flood of new semiconductor capacity and Herwick says investors may even be experiencing a bottoming of high tech sentiment now.
Despite some bullish comments about spot prices of 16-megabit computer memory chips by companies like Micron Technologies Inc., which said this week spot prices for the chips have risen 50 percent in recent weeks, executives remain cautious.
Micron's chairman, Steven Appleton, warned that although markets exaggerate the up and down cycles of the semiconductor business, it is folly to ever believe these swings will disappear.
Likewise, Herwick said some semiconductor executives are worried about further capacity coming on-line despite the apparent efforts of Korean chipmakers to curb output, and this could impact pricing for the next-generation  64-bit memory chips in the second half.
Several of the Internet companies stressed, as they had in their initial share offering documents, that they have limited operating histories and are focused foremost on gaining market share and revenues.
""There's one thing on our minds, and that's revenue,"" said Bruce Wilson, executive vice president of CyberCash, Inc., at a presentation late Thursday.
Further consolidation is expected in the Internet space.
The on-line chat company iChat noted in its presentation here that 99 percent of all Internet traffic is already commanded by less then one percent of all sites, and others said this concentration is only expected to increase.
Forrester Research CEO George Colony said he expects many leaders in existing physical markets will successfully enter and dominate the on-line world as well, over time.
Referring to Amazon.com, the Seattle-based Internet bookseller which currently runs one of the hottest Internet merchant sites, Colony said established companies may yet come to dominate space.
""Do you think three to four years from now Amazon.com will be a major brand?"" he asked in a panel discussion this week. ""I call them Amazon.toast.""
In an apparently unrelated decision, Amazon.com, the company, canceled its presentation at the conference, Robertson Stephens announced.

10,"Sun Microsystems Inc. said Monday it will move to build on the momentum behind its Java computer programming language despite overtures by Microsoft Corp. to co-opt Sun's initiative.
The president of Sun's JavaSoft unit, Alan Baratz, said the company will unveil several new initiatives at the second annual JavaOne software developers' conference in San Francisco later this week.
At the same time, some developers were buzzing with expectation that Microsoft on Wednesday may spell out its own plans for Java, including some which may not sit well with other Java licensees.
As the dominant supplier of operating systems for personal computers, Microsoft is among the more critical licensees of Java, which promises to operate across otherwise incompatible computing systems.
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates is due to address a software developers conference in one hall of San Francisco's Moscone Center the same day JavaSoft unveils its latest initiatives in another part of the same convention center.
Microsoft would not comment Monday on its plans, but the showdown follows a months-long tug of war between the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant and Sun's JavaSoft unit.
Earlier this year, Sun teamed up with International Business Machines Corp., Netscape Communications Corp. and Novell Inc. to launch a ""100 percent pure Java"" branding campaign aimed at ensuring Java retains its ability to work on multiple computer systems.
The initiative was designed to keep Microsoft -- or any other licensees -- from appropriating the technology, according to its proponents.
Microsoft, meanwhile, complained Sun had deliberately made a new Java version incompatible with recent releases of Microsoft's Windows.
Two weeks ago, JavaSoft applied to become a standards-setting body which could submit Java and its various upgrades to become standards under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization.
At the time, a Microsoft executive complained Sun was not surrendering the Java branding and compliance process to the standards board, an action JavaSoft retorted would break with industry practice.
Michael Kwatinetz, the lead analyst in Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's high technology group, said Microsoft's objective is to stay at the forefront of the software development community by continuing to extend its tools into the hot Java arena.
In an interview ahead of JavaOne, which starts Wednesday after a Tuesday gathering of Java licensees, Baratz said Sun was introducing a combination of new products and specifications aimed at the server computers used by large organizations for handling computer networks.
He also said that, as a separate intitiative, Sun will announce sharply scaled-down varieties of Java -- PersonalJava and EmbeddedJava -- which will be able to work on a variety of small devices.
These would bring Java to personal digital assistants such as Apple Computers Inc.'s Newton, copiers and even smart cards, as well as televisions, pagers and cellular phones, changing the definition of what a computer is, according to Javasoft executives.
""The momentum behind Java continues to grow,"" said Baratz, adding the JavaOne show is sold out with more than 9,000 developers registered and an estimated 400,000 developers now seriously using Java worldwide.

10,"Sun Microsystems Inc. will Tuesday announce its entry into the supercomputing systems market long dominated by Cray Research, which was acquired by Silicon Graphics Inc. last year.
Sun executives said in interviews ahead of the Tuesday announcement that their new Sun Ultra HPC servers, or computers that manage the flow of data in a network, will offer better price performance than Silicon Graphic's Origin 2000 and International Business Machine Corp.'s RS6000 SP.
Industry analysts said the move could make Sun an aggressive new player in a market that has been changed over the last decade by new massively-parallel computers that use lots of small processors to work simultaneously on different parts of a problem in order to reach a solution more quickly.
""It's revolutionary for them,"" said Dataquest analyst Jerry Sheridan. ""It presents a competitive environment. SGI is a strong competitor in the technical arena.""
Executives at Sun, which bought part of Cray's computing business from Silicon Graphics as part of the Silicon Graphics-Cray deal, said Tuesday's announcement was the first of a series of developments aimed at boosting Sun's share in the high performance computing market from virtually nothing last year.
Sun noted International Data Corp. projects the market for the world's most powerful computers, used for everything from nuclear weapons and environmental modelling to aerospace and automotive design, will hit $5.6 billion by 2000.
""We're leveraging into the markets where we've been traditionally successful -- that is the markets of the technical, engineering and scientific user,"" said Jamie Enns, manager of product marketing at Sun Microsystems Computer Co.
Sun's ultimate objective is to have a stake similar to the estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of the market now held by Silicon Graphics, he said. ""This is a five year programme.""
Enns said the core product is based on the Enterprise Server 3000 to ES 6000 line of products Sun introduced in April 1996 and adds supercomputing features. Sun said the U.S. list price for the systems will range from $43,745 to more than $2.5 million.

39,"Global miner RTZ-CRA on Wednesday announced a major relignment of its sprawling minerals empire and removed any doubt that London was its capital.
The group, born of a 1995 merger of RTZ Plc and CRA Ltd, said it would now manage its world-wide businesses along six main product lines -- aluminium, copper, energy, industrial minerals, iron ore, and gold and other minerals.
It also said it would downsize its Melbourne office, CRA Ltd's headquarters, halving the number of jobs there and reducing its role to a support function.  
CRA chairman John Uhrig said in outlining the changes that the merger, which maintained the two firm' separate listings, had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders.
""It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation,"" Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne.
The restructure leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium, energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters, RTZ-CRA said.  
The Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group's Johannesburg office would be closed, it added.
The new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world, where operations differ by country, toward a single management for each global business.
It eliminates problems of overlapping time zones and managements, ensuring the group does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with rivals dealing in just one commodity, the group said.  
Chief executive Leon Davis gave examples where, under the current structure, copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe.
""These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them,"" Davis told the news conference.
""It will eliminate duplication, lower our costs and improve our efficiency,"" he added.
Mining analysts welcomed the move, with one seeing it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage, made without RTZ making a takeover bid, was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA.  
""If anyone thought the DLC (dual-listed structure) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office,"" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters.
The analyst said he expected the group to go a step further and rationalise its assets and then transform the dual-listed structure into the one company.
RTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known, subject to shareholder approval this year, as Rio Tinto. RTZ's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd.  
A Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group's headquarters came as no surprise. ""It doesn't make any sense to have two head offices,"" he said.
That would come as cold comfort for the 100 people whose jobs have been scrapped in Melbourne under the reorganisation.
But RTZ-CRA said it would carry out the job cuts as painlessly as possible. ""The group will provide both practical and financial assistance to help their transition,"" it said.

39,"Bougainville's secessionist rebel leader Francis Ona said he feared his mountainous, jungle-clad South Pacific island would be destroyed by mining if it failed to win independence from Papua New Guinea.
Ona, political leader of the rebels, said in a rare interview aired on Australian radio on Tuesday he believed Papua New Guinea would allow the remote, resource-rich island to be plundered by foreign miners.
""Bougainville seems to be on top of a big mineral resource. We truly believe that all the island of Bougainville is under threat of destruction by these foreign companies,"" Ona told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Papua New Guinea on Sunday announced it wanted to buy back the foreign interest in Bougainville's giant Panguna copper mine, closed in 1989 after sabotage attacks by rebels.
Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan said the buy-back scheme would result in a financial compensation package for landowners and, along with the hiring of mercenaries, was aimed at ending the nine-year rebellion.
Development of the mine fuelled secessionist sentiment among Bougainvilleans who felt they were not sharing in its wealth.
The mine, which opened in 1972, swelled the Papua New Guinea government's coffers by producing 160,000 tonnes of copper concentrate annually, increasing local resentment on the island. The mine also produced copper and silver.
Ona, president of the rebels' self-declared Bougainville Interim Government, said the Panguna mine would be restarted and four other mines approved if the independence struggle failed.
He named four other areas he said were ripe for mining, including Buka, a small island a short canoe ride to the north of Bougainville where Papua New Guinea troops are based.
""Without independence Papua New Guinea is going to enforce those five mines on Bougainville,"" Ona said.
Chan has said he wants to buy control of the Panguna mine from global mining group RTZ-CRA, which owns 53.6 percent of the mine operator Bougainville Copper Ltd.
Mining analysts have said it would take three to four years to restart the Panguna mine and that a political solution was essential for any mining activity on Bougainville.
Ona and other rebel leaders were targetted for capture in mid-1996 when the Papua New Guinea government launched an offensive to snatch control of rebel-held areas on the island.
Since the demise of ""Operation High Speed"", Papua New Guinea has hired a British-based supplier of mercenaries, Sandline International, to train troops for a mission to Bougainville.
The presence of 40 mercenaries now in Papua New Guinea has attracted strong criticism from Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the United States and South Africa.
The Bougainville conflict has claimed hundreds of lives since sporadic guerrilla warfare first broke out on the island in 1988, and has attracted charges of human rights abuses by both troops and rebels.

39,"Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) said on Tuesday it would probe French insurer Axa-UAP's move into China, insisting it must hand ownership of Asian businesses to its Australian subsidiary.
""The board will critically examine the matter,"" a FIRB spokesman told Reuters by telephone from Canberra.
""It's a major matter -- absolutely,"" he added.
Axa-UAP said last week Chinese authorities had given it the green light to sell life insurance in China.  
The announcement hardly mentioned Axa-UAP's 51 percent owned Australian-based subsidiary, life office National Mutual Holdings Ltd, which is the Axa group's Asian arm.
National Mutual, which had separately applied for a licence to operate in China, has said it is not clear what role, ""if any"", the Australian company will play in Axa's China business.
When Axa bought 51 percent of National Mutual in 1995, the Australian government agreed to the foreign investment on the condition the parent make National Mutual its Asian arm.  
The government's FIRB approved the foreign investment provided Axa ""transferred its existing life insurance interests to National Mututal Holdings"" and pursue ""its Asia Pacific life insurance business strategy through that company"".
Insurance analysts have speculated Axa would retain ownership of the potentially lucrative China business, but would pay National Mutual's 69-percent subsidiary, Hong Kong-based National Mutual Asia, to manage it.
But the FIRB spokesman said the board, in approving Axa's investment in National Mutual, cleary intended for Axa to hand ownership of its Asian businesses to the Australian company.  
""It means ownership,"" the spokesman said.
FIRB will seek dialogue with both Axa and National Mutual in order to examine how the China business will be run, he said.
Ultimately, if the conditions of Axa's investment in National Mutual were found to be breached, the government could move to enforce those conditions, he added.
""There are powers under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act which enable the government to enforce compliance with the conditions of approval,"" he said.
""There are penalties available...,"" he added. He declined to comment further.  
In an earlier case, the Australian government ruled that Canadian company CanWest Global Communication Corp  CCSs.TO had to reduce its stake in the Ten Group Ltd because it was inconsistent with the government's foreign investment policy.

39,"Chemicals and plastics group ICI Australia Ltd posted on Wednesday a steep fall in annual net profit, blaming it in part on sharply lower plastics prices, but said the company was poised for major new expansion in Asia.
Managing director Warren Haynes said the group's net profit after abnormals of A$197 million reflected a difficult year to September 30, but the ""pain"" of restructuring and efficiency drives over the period would start to pay off in 1996/97.  
""We have in place a sounder base going into (1996-)'97 in terms of lower fixed costs, better volume in terms of upgrades of plants and lower variable costs...,"" he told reporters here.
Trading profit from the plastic division almost disappeared in 1995/96, plummeting to A$2 million from a record result of A$73 million in 1994/95 and mirroring a similarly sharp drop in world plastics prices from mid-1995, he said.
Plastic prices have fallen on average by US$400 per tonne since their peak of A$1,250 per tonne in June 1995, he said.  
ICI Australia, owned 62.4 percent by British chemicals giant Imperial Chemical Industries Plc, makes about 300 tonnes of plastics each year.
The company's paints, vinyls and chemicals businesses also reported weak results in 195/96, due to sluggish building activity in Australia, but its Incitec Ltd fertiliser subsidiary put in a strong performance in the year.
""That's offset the two very severe effects of the building industry and downturn in plastics prices to some extent,"" Haynes said.  
ICI Australia is not banking on a rise in plastics prices in 1996/97, but believes it is now in a stronger competitive position due to the recent conversion of its Sydney plastics plant to more efficient ethane feedstock.
The switch to ethane from a mixed feedstock of liquified petroleum gas and naphtha has fundamentally changed ""the whole economics for the plastics business for ICI Australia"", he said.
The company also shed 500 jobs in 1995/96, or six percent of its workforce, including about 100 jobs lost due to the closure of vinyl production in Sydney, Haynes said.  
""Whilst we have got ourselves in good shape in terms of costs and capacity, I can't predict what the outcome will be (for 1996/97),"" he said, adding that world prices and domestic demand would determine the direction of profits.
ICI Australia would continue in 1996/97 to run capital expenditure at about A$350 million, but the portion spent in Asia will at least double to about A$50 million, Haynes said.
The group spent around A$20 million in 1995/96 in Asia, where it invested in polyethylene manufactuere in Malaysia, a resin plant in China and explosives production in Indonesia.  
New investments in the region could be much larger, and investments ranging anywhere from A$20 million to A$100 million would be considered, Haynes said.
""We have started to move into Asia in (1995-)'96 and we have plans to move further into Asia in (1996-)'97,"" he said.
""We would expect to step that up in '97 and possibly with investments on a larger scale than in '96, but we also see investment opportunities in Australia,"" he added.

39,"Australian resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co (BHP) posted a 9.8-percent fall in first-half profits on Friday, disappointing the share market but avoiding another mauling by investors.
BHP, whose shares have been hammered since its key markets in steel and copper turned sour six months ago, posted a A$790 million (US$628 million) net profit for the six months to November 30, down from A$867 for the same period last year.
But Australia's largest quoted company had its bottom line boosted by an abnormal gain of A$107 million and investors were initially not impressed.
The share price were up 54 cents to a high of A$17.59 just after the result then took a tumble and settled at around A$17.20 in early afternoon trading.
But late buying across the board helped BHP, the market bellwether stock, recover ground and the stock closed at A$17.48, 43 three cents higher than Thursday's close.
""It's pretty lousy,"" one fund manager's stock analyst told Reuters soon after the release. Another analyst disappointed with the result said the resources giant was still on track for a modest profit recovery for the full year to May 31, 1997.
Though forecast signs of improvement emerged in BHP's battered copper division, with the North American copper operations swinging back into profit, analysts had been tipping a first-half group pre-abnormal result of around A$760 million.
BHP's pre-abnormal net profit of A$683 million was 15.8 percent down on the corresponding 1995/96 period.
But managing director John Prescott said the second quarter figures showed an accelerating improvement in performance and that, despite weak copper and steel prices, the group was still investing in future growth.
Citing a sharp jump in exploration expenditure in the half year, he told reporters: ""That's an important part of sustaining our growth.""
""I think we are moving ahead,"" he added. ""We have a lot of work to do and we're going to build the company around its high-quality assets and we are starting to see the results of our work.""
Including abnormals, BHP's minerals, copper and steel divisions all contributed higher earnings in the latest three months against the August quarter. The steel division was flat.
Petroleum was the biggest earner with A$253 million for the quarter, but this included an abnormal gain of A$107 million from the settlement of a dispute over a gas resource tax.
BHP Petroleum's pre-abormal result also included a A$82 million windfall from asset sales and a larger than expected exploration expense.
BHP's minerals division, a major world producer of iron ore and coal, doubled its contribution to profit in the second quarter to A$154 million, due largely to higher world prices.
BHP Copper benefitted from a recent firming in the copper price and a cut of seven U.S. cents per pound in its North American operating costs to post a second quarter profit of A$132 million, up from A$85 million in the first quarter.
The U.S. copper operations, acquired last January with the US$2.4 billion purchase of Magma Copper, made a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter. Prescott said on Friday Magma had swung back into profit in the second quarter.
BHP Steel's second-quarter profit was flat at A$90 million.

39,"Australia's Trust Bank said on Friday a locally listed insurer and two offshore institutions had expressed interest in buying a 49 percent stake in the bank.
Trust Bank managing director Paul Kemp declined to name the three groups but said such an early response to the bank's quest for a long-term strategic partner was a good sign.
""We have had three expressions that are potentially worth listening to,"" Kemp told Reuters.  
They were from a local insurer, an unlisted offshore insurer and another offshore financial instution, thought to be a bank, which approached the Trust Bank through an intermediary.
Tasmania-based Trust Bank announced in March that it was looking for a strategic partner to take a 49 percent stake, hopefully by early 1998.
The bank then plans to issue 41 percent of its equity to the public by the end of 1998 and embark on national expansion.
Trust Bank is effectively owned by a community trust and, like mutual societies, has no shareholders.  
It has net assets of A$143 million, implying a total value of A$257 million, based on the goodwill paid in the sale of another regional Australian bank, BankWest Ltd, in 1995.
One insurance analyst said the most likely local insurer to have expressed an interest in taking a stake in Trust Bank was Sydney-based GIO Australia Holdings Ltd.
National Mutual Holdings Ltd has ruled out any interest in acquiring a banking licence, saying it is no longer worth paying a premium due to convergence in the industry.
Colonial Ltd already owns a bank.  
The analyst said it was unlikely any of the other seven listed insurers would be interested.
""I imagine it's probably GIO, but it doesn't sound to me like it would be a big issue whether it got it or not,"" the Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters.
The value of a bank to an insurer would be the bank's distribution network, the analyst said.
But Trust Bank's branch network is confined mainly to Tasmania state, its home market.
It has just four branches outside Tasmania.  
Trust Bank's Kemp said the bank would soon choose a big global accountancy firm to help it identify a partner. It is also drafting an information memorandum for potential partners.
Kemp insisted a banking licence was still a valuable asset for non-bank institutions. ""You are going to get an immediate foothold in the Australian market place,"" he said.
""You are going to acquire a franchise which has considerable value, you are going to get a distribution network. You are going to hire a level of expertise,"" he said.  
Trust Bank has ruled out any of the other local banks as a strategic partner, saying none of them would be interested in fulfilling Trust bank's broader ambitions.

39,"Australia's biggest retailer Coles Myer Ltd on Thursday reported a 41 percent surge in half-year earnings, its first profit rise in almost two years.
The result buoyed Coles' once-sinking share price, which firmed despite a weaker market, and follows a two-year nightmare of sliding profits, controversy and tight-fisted consumers.
Coles, which pockets nearly 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, reported a net profit of A$273.6 million for half-year ended January 26, against A$194.5 million a year ago.  
Before abnormals, net earnings leapt 23 percent to a better-than-expected A$229 million, boosting the shares 10 cents above Wednesday's close to A$6.01 (US$4.74) in morning trade.
""What is important are people's expectations of the turnaround now. I think that's why the stock is where it is, on anticipation of much better margins and profit,"" a broker said.

39,"Australian life office National Mutual Holdings Ltd is tipped to make a strong, historic debut on the Australian and New Zealand bourses on Tuesday after its institutional offer closed six times oversubscribed last week.
The final price of A$1.60 per share was higher than the indicative bidding range initially set for institutions, and gives Australia's second biggest life office a market capitalisation of A$2.7 billion (US$2 billion) on listing.
""It was very significantly over-subscribed and at A$1.60 there's no doubt that we could have sold it a number of times over,"" National Mutual managing director Geoff Tomlinson told Reuters in an interview on Monday.
National Mutual is Australia's first listed life office and, at A$1.60 per share, will rank among the market's top 30 firms.
The shares could climb steeply on both the Australian and New Zealand exchanges on Tuesday, as institutional bidders which failed to secure enough shares in the offer step into the market to lift their stakes, share analysts told Reuters on Monday.
Institutions received on average only about 15 percent of the allotments sought, a market source told Reuters.
""There's certainly keen demand...,"" Morgan Stockbroking's director of equities, Bill Chatterton, said. The shares could reach a high of A$1.80, he added.
National Mutual's listing completes its 21-month transition from a mutual company owned by its policy-holders to a listed group free to pursue its strategic focus on Asia, unshackled by a mutual requirement to act solely in policy-holders' interests.
National Mutual will be owned 51 percent on listing by its French parent, the insurance and financial services giant Axa SA, which is prevented under the terms of the float from selling down its stake for six months after the listing.
Axa, which effectively bought into National Mutual last year at around A$1.25 per share, is sitting on an enormous paper profit. It cannot increase its stake in National Mutual unless given the Australian government's go-ahead.
Under the float, National Mutual's 1.2 million policy holders were offered either shares or a cash alternative. Shares not taken up were offered to retail investors and institutions.
Retail investors were offered the shares at A$1.50 each last month, before the final price was set at the close of institutional bidding last Friday, giving mums and dads a strong temptation to take a quick profit on Tuesday, analysts said.
""There's going to be a fair amount of underlying demand from institutions to get the stock, but there may be a little bit of stag profit-taking as well,"" a Melbourne-based analyst said.
National Mutual's Tomlinson said the listing, demutualisation and last year's capital injection of A$1.1 billion by Axa marked the end of a tough four years, especially for life subsidiary National Mutual Life.
""Tomorrow will mark the end of a four-year diffcult period and put us into a new area where we can...finalise the turnaround of National Mutual Life in Australia and New Zealand and try to take further advantage of our opportunities in Asia,"" he said.

Gascor will be be split into three separate, competing distributors by July 1, ahead of their sale from mid-1998.  
The Victoria government has already sold over A$13 billion worth of electricity assets, making it the leader in efforts to set up a national free market for energy.
""Gascor is currently ill-equipped to compete in the fast approaching national gas market,"" Stockdale told the conference.
""It is the vision of this government to create an integrated energy market that will deliver low-cost energy to industry and householders, providing Australia with an important boost to its competitiveness...,"" he added.  
Gascor has 1.4 million customers throughout Melbourne, 50 towns in rural Victoria and some border towns in New South Wales state. Its balance sheet shows net assets of A$1.14 billion.
Interest in the Gascor businesses, to be known by individual names, is likely to come from private power utilities already operating in Australia and from new foreign entrants.
""I think a lot of the companies currently involved in electricity will also be interested in gas,"" said Walter Dewe, a a consultant who once headed a national taskforce on gas reform.
""I think there will be new ones that missed out for electricity and also gas companies,"" he told Reuters.  
Offshore interest in Australia's emerging national energy market has come chiefly from the Britain and the United States.
A consortium led by Britain's National Power Plc spent A$2.35 billion last year to buy Victoria's Hazelwood coal-fired power station.
Earlier, another consortium headed by British-based Powergen Plc bought another Victoria generator, Yallourn Energy, for A$2.43 billion.
U.S. utility Edison International has a controlling stake in another coal-fired power plant through its Edison Mission Energy unit.  
U.S.-based Northern States Power Co is also eyeing the Australian market, declaring it was ""hell-bent on acquisitions"" in Australia this year.
Under the terms of the Victoria privatisation, gas prices will be capped below the cost of inflation until the year 2001.
Until then, only major gas consumers will be able to shop around among gas companies for the best deal, with all other consumers able to do so in 2001, regardless of where they live.
The move comes as plans are being drawn up to link the two biggest states, Victoria and New South Wales, with new pipelines to create a seamless gas market in the country's southeast.

39,"Two big U.S. power companies said on Monday they would continue investing billions of dollars in Asian energy assets to help drive profits at home.
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp and Minnesota-based NRG Energy Inc, which last month combined to buy control of Australia's richest power station and coal mine, said they were eyeing other major investments in Australia and Southeast Asia.
""Both companies here are very active in the Asian region,"" said David Weaver, of CMS Asia, after settling the A$4.75-billion (US$3.7-billion) Australian purchase.
""This is not the first pot shot at a project. This is part of a very clear strategy of building a business across the region, not just picking up the odd project...""
Weaver and the U.S.-based chiefs of CMS and NRG were in Melbourne to present the Victoria state government a cheque for the Loy Yang A power station and coal mine.
The sale of the 2,000-megawatt plant, the most efficient in Australia, stands as the nation's single biggest privatisation.
CMS, which took 50 percent of Loy Yang, and NRG, which took 25 percent, said on Monday they would be natural partners for other major investments in Australia or elsewhere in the region.  
""There will be, before too long, another large project where we would work together, whether that be here or in Southeast Asia,"" said NRG's Asia-Pacific chief, David Scaysbrook.
""Both companies are actively interested in pursuing privatisations...,"" he told a joint media briefing.
He cited Indonesia, saying it was looking to sell a part or all of its electricity generating system, as well as possible sales of state-owned assets in the Philippines and Thailand.
CMS aims to build its offshore asset base to 40 percent of the group, with Southeast Asia the likely home for most of this capital, said CMS chief operating officer Vic Fryling.
CMS now has 20 percent of its US$9 billion asset base in offshore investments and is active in 10 Asian countries.
It runs India's only independent power station, a gas-fired plant in Andhra Pradesh state. It also runs three plants in the Philippines and is developing a gas business there, Weaver said.
""We are looking at the commercial nuclear plants in the Philippines,"" he added.
CMS is an integrated energy company that spreads its investment from gas exploration to electricity generation. NRG focuses mainly on electricity generation.  
NRG is soon to close a deal on building and operating a joint venture coal-fired power station in West Java, Indonesia.
The deal, to be closed in four to six weeks, will be followed by ""our second deal in Asia in the next few months"", said NRG's Scaysbrook. He said the investment involved gas-fired power generation but declined to say more.
NRG's parent, Northern States Power Co, is dependent on NRG for earnings growth and, in turn, NRG is looking to Asia to help deliver, said NRG chief executive David Paterson.
""We (NRG) have committed to them (NSP) that we will provide 20 percent of their earnings by the year 2000, and we are a little bit less than half of that at the moment,"" Paterson said.

2,"Although a Canadian federal election is not expected to be called until this weekend, the mudslinging has already begun.
Reform Party leader Preston Manning, defensive after charges of racism in his right-wing opposition party, sought to turn the tables on the rival Conservatives on Thursday.
The two parties face a battle for the right-wing vote. Reform won the third most seats in its inaugural national election campaign in 1993, while the Conservatives plummeted to two seats after nine years of rule.
But Reform has been haunted by accusations of racism through its 3-1/2 year term in Parliament.
Questioned by reporters on Thursday about Reform's record on tolerance, Manning accused the Conservatives of choosing a candidate based on race.
Manning produced a clipping from a Vancouver newspaper, which quoted a Conservative official as saying he deliberately sought election candidates who were not Sikh so the candidate could distinguish himself from the other parties' Sikh candidates.
""If we'd said that, we'd be crucified,"" Manning told the National Press Club in Ottawa. He urged the media to challenge the Tories on the comment, but denied he was mudslinging.
""I don't like any of that stuff,"" he said.
A Conservative spokesman brushed off Manning's remarks as ""electioneering.""
The ruling Liberals are widely expected to call an election this weekend for June 2. While recent polls predicted the Liberals would retain power, pre-election campaigning has taken on a bitter flavor, with name-calling and accusations of racism and sexism becoming more frequent.
Liberal Defense Minister Doug Young was criticized recently for sexist remarks. On Tuesday, Reform member of parliament Ian McClelland called Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps a ""bitch"" in the House of Commons and was forced to withdraw his remark.
Also this week, British Columbia Reform official George Rigaux resigned after saying that Sikh leaders were corrupting nominations in his riding. Conservative leader Jean Charest said on Wednesday that voters should be alarmed about charges of racism and sexism surrounding the Reform party.
The Conservative and Reform parties are trying to carve out distinct images as they compete for the conservative vote. In trying to portray itself as a grassroots party, Reform has had to fend off a reputation for extremism.
Last May, Reform members of parliament opposed a Liberal bill to expand rights for homosexuals. One Reform member of parliament said that if he owned a business he would move black or gay employees ""to the back of the shop"" or even fire them if their presence annoyed bigoted customers.
His comments were backed by another Reform member of parliament. Both were disciplined by the Reform caucus.
During the 1993 campaign, Reform had to dump a candidate after he acknowledged making anti-immigrant remarks.

2,"Canada's Barrick Gold Corp on Monday dropped out of the race to control the vast Busang gold find in Indonesia, losing a long battle for the right to mine the deposit to U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc.
But analysts warned that the struggle to control Busang, possibly the world's biggest gold deposit, may not have ended. Placer Dome Inc, another big Canadian mining concern, said it has not given up hope of grabbing a piece of Busang.
""This thing is far from over,"" said Fred Ketchen, vice-president of Toronto brokerage ScotiaMcLeod.
Calgary's Bre-X Minerals Ltd, which discovered the 71-million-ounce Busang gold find, announced on Monday it had reached a deal with Freeport, shortly before an Indonesian government deadline was due to expire.
Under the deal, Freeport will own 15 percent of Busang find, Bre-X will keep 45 percent and Indonesian interests will take 40 percent.
The deal convinced Barrick, which has spent months negotiating for control of Busang, to give up its quest.
""We put forward our proposal last week and said to Bre-X that if you can find a better deal, we wish you success,"" spokesman Vince Borg said. ""For us to go beyond the proposal would not be in the best interest of our shareholders.""
He declined to elaborate on Barrick's final offer, citing a confidentiality agreement.
Many details needed to evaluate the Freeport deal remained a mystery on Monday, causing confusion in the stock market.
Bre-X said Freeport, based in Louisiana, will provide US$400 million or 25 percent of the capital costs of the Busang project. Freeport will borrow US$1.2 billion to fund the rest of the costs. But neither Bre-X nor Freeport would say how much would be paid to Bre-X.
""We're not making a comment until the (Indonesian) government announcement tomorrow,"" said a Freeport spokeswoman in New Orleans.
Since Bre-X did not mention any compensation from Indonesian interests or Freeport, observers have to assume there will be none, analysts said. Most analysts put a C$25 to C$30 target on Bre-X shares. The shares opened at C$25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday and sank quickly to C$23.50 by midafternoon.
""This has been very expensive for Bre-X. But Freeport has a pretty good deal here,"" said Rick Cohen, gold analyst at Goepel Shields in Vancouver.
The government of Indonesian President Suharto is expected to respond on Tuesday to the proposed deal. Freeport and Bre-X need government approval before going ahead.
""It's a tremendous loss for Barrick,"" said Cohen.
Barrick, the world's second biggest gold producer, had maneuvered aggressively to grab control of Busang, spending months negotiating with Bre-X and Indonesian officials.
It formed an alliance with Suharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and used its powerful advisory board -- which includes former U.S. president George Bush and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney -- to cultivate ties with other influential Indonesians.
Meanwhile, Placer Dome Chief Executive Officer John Willson, said his company would re-evaluate its US$5 billion offer to merge with Bre-X, but would still be willing to use its financial resources and expertise to help develop Busang.
""Given the size, complexity and importance of Busang to Indonesia, we remain prepared to contribute our financial resources and unique mine development capabilities to this very attractive project,"" Willson said. ""Naturally, we are disappointed by the news that we were not selected as the developer and operator.""
If the Indonesian government grants Bre-X and Freeport the right to develop Busang, Bre-X could quickly become a takeover target for a large company that would not mind allowing Freeport operate the mine, analysts said.
But Barrick is unlikely to jump back into the race, said gold analyst Chad Williams with Research Capital in Montreal.
""I think Barrick would be apprehensive of buying out Bre-X because Bre-X is not the operator. It would be more amenable to Placer Dome.""
"
2,"With the ruling Liberals far ahead in the polls, the biggest question in the campaign for Canada's June 2 federal election is not who will win but which opposition party will place second.
""It's an election that's quite unlike what you see in other Western countries because there really is no realistic option (aside from the Liberals),"" Reg Whitaker, a political scientist at York University in Toronto, said recently.
""The opposition parties are fighting for small markets. It's wide open for the Liberals.""
Despite opposition criticism of the Liberals' record on national unity, unemployment and taxes, polls show the Liberal party with a consistently strong lead.
The official opposition since the last election in 1993 has been the Bloc Quebecois, whose sole aim is promoting Quebec independence, not forming a federal government. ""They want to put themselves out of business,"" Whitaker said. ""So right off you have a bizarre situation.""
Prime Minister Jean Chretien called the June 2 election on Sunday. In the last election in 1993, the Liberals won 177 out of 295 seats, the Bloc Quebecois 54 seats, the Reform Party 52, the New Democrats nine and the Conservatives two. One independent was elected.
Unless one of two right-wing parties -- the Conservatives and Reform -- can consolidate nationwide support, analysts said, the Bloc was poised to be the official opposition again, keeping the Quebec sovereignty issue on the front burner.
Reform, with strong roots in western Canada but feeble support elsewhere, has painted itself as the only party that can hold the Liberals accountable. But it stops short of seeking the role of government for now.
""Our ultimate objective is to get a Reform government,"" party leader Preston Manning said recently. But when asked about his immediate goal, he said he wanted to win enough seats to form the official opposition.
""They're mainly concerned about holding on to what they've got,"" Whitaker said. Reform had 50 seats when the House of Commons was dissolved on Sunday.
The Conservatives, led by Quebecker Jean Charest, stubbornly maintain they can form the next government, but the right-leaning party has a long way to go. In 1993 the party, one of the oldest in Canada and the ruling party from 1984 to 1993, lost all but two of its seats in the House of Commons.
""They have some severe limitations,"" Whitaker said. ""You see the Conservative Party and the Reform Party fighting over the same right-wing margins.""
Reform and the Conservatives are both campaigning on smaller government and tax cuts as ways to fix Canada's persistent unemployment problem. The Conservatives, however, stand to gain in Quebec, while Reform has no base in the French-speaking province.
A poll in Quebec released on Monday showed support for the Liberals at 37 percent, the Bloc at 35 percent and the Conservatives at 25 percent.
Alone on Canada's left wing is the New Democratic Party, which makes no claims to forming a government.
""Federally, we've never made a government, but we've always been there to make a difference,"" NDP leader Alexa McDonough said as she launched her campaign last weekend.
But the Liberals have co-opted the NDP too, appealing to moderate left-wing Canadians with talk of preserving health care, social programmes and the national pension system, and promoting Liberal legislation on gun control.
"
2,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lost a bid on Tuesday to freeze shares in Inco Ltd. worth $152 million belonging to international mining financier Robert Friedland.
The EPA had said that Friedland should be held responsible for environmental problems at a former gold mine in Summitville, Colorado. It requested an injunction on the shares until it could sue Friedland for $152 million in costs to clean up the Summitville site.
But an Ontario Court judge Tuesday shot down the EPA's arguments and scolded the agency for the ""nondisclosure and misrepresentations"" that he said riddled its case.
""The evidence has led me to the conclusion that the liability of Robert Friedland is anything but clear,"" Justice Robert Sharpe of Ontario Court's general division said as he read his decision.
He ordered that the Inco shares be held by Friedland's lawyers until Friday afternoon to give the United States a chance to apply for an appeal.
Lawyers for the United States would not say if they would appeal.
""This is the most devastating judgment they've ever had,"" Friedland lawyer Alan Lenczner said in an interview. ""This is just unprofessional.""
Friedland gained the Inco stock as part of Inco's takeover last August of Diamond Fields Resources, a company run by Friedland, which controlled the huge Voisey's Bay nickel deposit in remote Labrador.
In the 1980s, Friedland founded and ran Galactic Resources Ltd., the company that controlled the Summitville mine and the firm the EPA said was responsible for the pollution.
The EPA wanted Friedland's assets frozen since it said it had a strong case against Friedland in Colorado.
But the Ontario judge said the EPA's case was far from strong. The EPA failed to show that Friedland was directly responsible for any pollution in Summitville, he said.
""In my view there are serious shortcomings in the case of the United States,"" he said.
More important, the United States did not present the court with the full and fair information required for an injunction, making it hard for the judges who granted the injunction to make a fair decision, the judge said.
""This is a serious departure from the fundamental integrity of the judicial process,"" he said.
A previous ruling from Sharpe ordered the United States to disclose all documents related to the case, not just the ones the agency had presented voluntarily.
Those documents showed the EPA had doubts about its ability to win the case against Friedland, the judge said.
""The extent of nondisclosure of the United States in this case is serious and fundamental.""
Galactic mined gold at the Summitville mine in the 1980s, using open-pit heap leaching methods where ore is placed on top of rubber pads and then sprayed with a cyanide mixture. Cyanide leaked through the pads, threatening the area's rivers.

2,"Canadian mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd has been in hiding since it announced 17 days ago that it has formed a partnership with the son of Indonesian ruler Suharto, prompting a flurry of comment on its ethics. (Corrects description of Suharto.)
Despite a constant whirl of rumors and persistent questions that have sent the company's shares on a roller coaster ride, Bre-X is maintaining a dogged silence. 
The Calgary-based company that controls one of the world's biggest gold prospects in Indonesia has not talked to the financial press for weeks. Company officials will take calls only from a handful of favoured analysts, according to market sources.
""I haven't had any calls returned,"" said gold analyst Rick Cohen with Goepel Shields in Vancouver. ""There seems to be a certain number of people they talk to. Everybody's a bit in the dark."" 
Bre-X sent out a news release on October 28 about its alliance Suharto's son, Sigit Harjojudanto, whose business influence is pervasive in Indonesia.
Since then, instead of directly addressing material questions about its business in Indonesia -- many of which are playing havoc with its stock price -- Bre-X has opted instead to leak to the market carefully selected press material.
On Sunday, for example, the company faxed the media, analysts and shareholders a copy of a story from the Far Eastern Economic Review detailing its links with Sigit. 
The article referred to Sigit's possible ties with the Indonesian army, stated flatly that one of Bre-X's Indonesian partners has been bought out and asserted that Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold Corp had tried to push Bre-X into a bad deal.
Despite questions about the article, Bre-X refused to respond and still has not said whether it endorses the story or puts any faith in the statements contained in the story.
""I've certainly suggested a few times that they talk to the media and clear things up,"" said Neil Winchester, manager of surveillance at the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
""It would be advantageous to the marketplace,"" he added.
Rumors have surrounded Bre-X since the Indonesian government said last month it would not issue essential contracts of work until Bre-X cleared up an ownership dispute with some of its Indonesian partners.
The dispute has placed a cloud over Bre-X's search to find a major mining partner to help it develop the rich Busang gold deposit in East Kalimantan, but the alliance with Suharto's son was expected to help the company clear up its problems. 
""They're optimistic that they can get everything (the permits) within a couple of weeks,"" said gold analyst Michael Fowler of Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, who said he spoke with Bre-X on Tuesday.
But he said Bre-X would not comment on the article it distributed. ""They just sent it out for general interest purposes,"" he added.
Still, the rumors in the article and other rampant gossip are taking a toll on shares linked to Bre-X. Other exploration companies in Asia have complained the uncertainty has spilled over and hurt their stocks. 
Minorca Resources Inc, a Canadian junior mining company that has an interest in the Busang deposit through an alliance with Bre-X's Indonesian partner, PT Askatindo Karya Mineral, has found itself on the defensive.
Talk about Askatindo being bought out is unfounded, Minorca president Roland Horst said in an interview. ""They have no intention to sell out,"" he said.
Minorca's chairman is in Indonesia this week meeting with Askatindo officials and verified the company's intentions.
""There were discussions, but they were rebuffed,"" said Horst. 
He added that he also had a slew of unanswered questions about Bre-X's arrangements with Suharto's son.
""To be frank, the relationship between Minorca and Bre-X is relatively cool.""

2,"Barrick Gold Corp said on Wednesday it was now the world's second largest gold producer, supplanting Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.
Barrick's 1996 gold production was 3,148,801 ounces, surpassing Gold Fields' 3,125,631 ounces for fiscal 1996. Barrick expects 1997 production to top three million ounces again.
The Toronto-based company posted a 40 percent increase in its proven and probable reserves to 51 million ounces from 36.5 million ounces. Barrick also reported 25 million ounces of gold in the resource category -- gold not fully proven yet.
Barrick has made no secret of its ambition to become the world's largest gold company, surpassing Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.
To clinch first place, Barrick is seeking control of the huge Busang deposit in Indonesia, said to be one of this century's most sensational gold discoveries.
Two new mines will also likely carry Barrick closer to its leadership goal. Drilling at Barrick's Pierina property in Peru expanded reserves there to 6.5 million ounces so far, Barrick said. The mine is expected to come into production in late 1999 at an annual rate of 500,000 ounces of gold.
Drilling at Barrick's Pascua mine in Chile bumped reserves to 10 million ounces so far, with 6.7 million ounces identified in the reserve category. The mine is scheduled to start production of 400,000 ounces a year by the year 2000.
Barrick has been negotiating with Calgary's Bre-X Minerals Ltd for months to control the Busang discovery, but Barrick's chances of success are up in the air.
""One of the messages they'll probably try to get across is that they are not desperate for it, they certainly don't need it, they have an awful lot already,"" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac with Deacon Capital in Toronto.
Barrick also said today that its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings fell, due mainly to higher operating and exploration costs. Fourth-quarter profit declined to US$56 million or US$0.15 a share from year earlier US$78 million or US$0.22 a share.
Full-year earnings declined to US$218 million or US$0.60 a share from US$292 million or US$0.82 a share in 1995.
Barrick was down 0.40 to 35.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in afternoon trading on Wednesday and by 3/8 to 26-1/2 in New York.

2,"Trade ministers from the Asia Pacific region agreed on Saturday to work toward free trade in financial services and expanding open markets for information technology.
The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum wrapped up its three-day trade ministers' meeting in Montreal, agreeing to look for ways to expand last year's information technology deal to include more products and more countries.
In the information technology sector, ""there are a number of both non-tariff measures and tariff measures that we might take up and we're hopeful that we'll see significant progress later this year,"" deputy U.S. trade representative Jeff Lang told a news conference. But Lang would not supply details on the kind of progress he hoped to see.
The information technology agreement included 41 countries and 91 percent of world trade now, but Lang said four or five more countries were interested.
The ministers also announced they were committed to forging a final financial services deal by December.
""Clearly what I'm hearing from the 18 members of APEC is that they want it to work this time,"" Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said after the final news conference. Eggleton chaired the three-day meeting since Canada will host the APEC summit scheduled for Vancouver in November.
Previous talks on an international agreement on financial services fell through last year after the United States pulled out because of its disappointment in offers from some other countries.
And U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned on Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers.
""The United States will put forward an MFN (most favored nation) consistent offer, but it will be conditional on achieving a critical mass in the Asian countries and Latin America,"" she told reporters.
Among the 18 APEC members, some of them will have progressive offers in time for the WTO deadline of mid-July, Barshefsky said.
""There are others who have shown reluctance. The same with Latin America,"" she said. ""These offers are going to have to be good, or the United States will seek an MFN exemption.""
Such an exemption would likely stall progress on the talks.
Last month, the United States said a financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice. It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial service providers, the United States said.
Chile's Trade Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said his country would do its best to make a good financial services offer.
""We are prepared to make our offer and try to improve it, if it's possible,"" Insulza told a news conference.
The world's major trading powers have agreed to put forward requests on financial services commerce by mid-June and offers by July 14 in the hopes of finalizing a deal by the end of December.
The United States and Canada emphasized the role APEC should take in isolating certain trade sectors, liberalizing them within APEC and then putting them on to the agenda at the World Trade Organization. APEC agreements are voluntary, while WTO deals are binding.
But the lesser developed countries that form a large part of APEC's membership appeared to place sectoral liberalization on a lower pedestal than the developed countries. Instead, they emphasized unilateral and voluntary plans to knock down trade barriers.
""I think we have to emphasize that the system talks about individual action plans as well as sectoral liberalization,"" said Cesar Bautista, the trade minister for the Phillipines.
Malaysia and Indonesia both stressed the need to help small and medium sized businesses develop trading strategies. They said they appreciated APEC's progress on cutting customs red tape and promoting international investment in infrastructure.

2,"Canada's Barrick Gold Corp seems poised to supplant two South African mining giants to become the world's biggest gold producer through an unprecedented deal which will give it a majority share in Indonesia's rich Busang gold discovery.
Barrick, whose high-profile board of directors includes a former U.S. President George Bush, on Wednesday confirmed weeks of rumors it was negotiating with Bre-X Minerals Ltd for a stake in the Busang deposit, which contains at least 47 million ounces of gold, possibly more.
The unusual negotiations were requested by the Indonesian government, which has urged Bre-X to hand over 75 percent of its Busang stake to Barrick and form a joint venture.
""If this thing comes off, it makes Barrick the leading gold producer in the world,"" said Fred Ketchen, vice-president of Toronto brokerage ScotiaMcLeod.
""It indicates the advantages to major companies in having such high profile people on their board as George Bush and (former Canadian prime minister) Brian Mulroney.""
Exploration at the Busang property is still in its early days, but already the potential promises to catapault Barrick's production above that of the world's two leading gold companies, Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd and Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.
Barrick started with basically no gold production in 1983 and grew through acquisition and exploration to produce about 3.1 million ounces a year.
Barrick's flamboyant chairman Peter Munk, a fabulously wealthy risk taker well connected in both business and politics, has made no secret of his ambition to make his company number one.
While neither Barrick nor Bre-X would comment on how Barrick managed to persuade the Indonesian government to virtually mandate a deal with Bre-X, pieces of an intriguing jigsaw are beginning to fit together.
Bre-X bought the Busang properties in 1993 and made the huge gold find in 1995. The discovery propelled the company's stock from pennies to over C$200 before a stock split.
After Bre-X announced it would search for a heavyweight mining partner in Busang, the Cinderella story turned sour.
One of Bre-X's Indonesian partners claimed rights to up to 40 percent of the deposit and threatened to sue. The Indonesian government then delayed granting Bre-X its vital mining permits because of the ensuing disputes. ""It's quite clear that Bre-X did not follow protocol in its ownership issues,"" said an analyst who asked not to be named.
So Bre-X set up a strategic alliance with the eldest son of Indonesia's President Suharto, hoping the alliance would help sort out its problems. At the same time, Barrick was worked behind the scenes to gain the upper hand, sources said.
""Peter Munk is a pretty smart guy,"" said Ketchen. ""No grass grows under his feet.""
Barrick developed a relationship with Suharto's eldest daughter, hiring her construction company for future mining work. It developed ties with the Indonesian government, probably using Bush and Mulroney's influence, sources said.
""They (Barrick) really did the end run. There was lots of arm twisting,"" said an executive at a rival mining company.
Spokesmen for both Bush and Mulroney declined comment.
With the Indonesian government almost forcing Bre-X into Barrick's arms, Bre-X has lost much of its bargaining power. ""The government is God here. It holds most of the cards,"" said Michael Fowler with brokerage Levesque Beaubien Geoffiron.
Jakarta has given the companies until December 4 to come up with an arrangement. If they do not, the Indonesian government could take matters into its own hands.
But on Wednesday Bre-X investors seemed confident that Bre-X would win a reasonable deal. They pushed the stock up C$0.65 to 21.00 in heavy trading. Barrick rose 0.75 to 39.65.
""At the end of the day, I believe Barrick will be fair,"" said Fowler. Barrick has an international reputation to uphold and could face lawsuits from Bre-X shareholders if it tries to undermine Bre-X. Barrick may buy part of Busang and act as operator, rather than bidding for Bre-X, analysts said.
""None of the parties involved here will walk away completely unscathed,"" said analyst David Christensen with Merrill Lynch in San Francisco.
With all the intrigue and rumor clouding the Busang developments, investors will always wonder if they've heard the whole story, he said.

2,"No final deal was in sight Wednesday for Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp., which are in the midst of forging a deal on one of the world's biggest gold deposits -- Indonesia's Busang.
As a Wednesday deadline slid by, Bre-X and Barrick said they were still trying to hammer out several issues, leaving the market to speculate about the status of negotiations.
A few issues remain to be solved, and Bre-X will have more news on the negotiations ""shortly,"" Chief Executive David Walsh said in an interview from New York.
He said the main issues that stand in the way of a full agreement with Barrick are ""regulatory"" but maintained he was prevented by a confidentiality agreement to give details.
""We need certain additional comfort in any agreement that would satisfy the regulatory authorities and our shareholders,"" he said.
The Indonesian government directed Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick by Dec. 4, with Barrick getting 75 percent of Bre-X's stake in the rich gold discovery and Bre-X keeping 25 percent. The companies were invited to consider giving the Indonesian government 10 percent of the rich find.
As the clocked ticked, Bre-X issued a statement saying no new deadline had been set by the Indonesian Mines Ministry. It said it expected the Ministry of Mines to clarify its stand on the outstanding issues ""in due course.""
The direction of negotiations is in the hands of the Indonesian government, Walsh said.
""We are waiting on the answers we get from the Minister of Mines,"" he said.
Sources close to the talks said Indonesian mining officials had left Jakarta and would not be back until Dec. 9.
""I think both sides are probably worried about the so-called deadline, which has come and gone,"" said gold analyst John Ing with Maison Placements Canada Inc. ""It's back in the lap of the Indonesians.""
In Jakarta, a senior Indonesian mines official said the government of President Suharto would explore other possibilities to develop Busang if the two companies fail to clinch a deal.
""If they cannot reach an agreement, the government will take the necessary and appropriate action ... to expedite the development of Busang's resouces,"" Umar Said, secretary-general of the Mines Department, told a news conference in Jakarta.
""What the action will be ... I have to get back to the government. This is not my playground,"" he added.
Meanwhile, investors pushed up Bre-X's stock C$1.30 to close at C$20.10 ($14.84) in heavy trading in Toronto Wednesday, while Barrick rose C$1.45 to C$39.30 ($29.01).
""People think there's an agreement that will come out sooner rather than later,"" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital in Toronto.
But she noted that the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations was preventing Bre-X's stock from rising to meet the level of rumoured offers of about C$25 ($18.50) a share from Barrick.
""We're actually hearing that (the deal) is done and they're just dotting the i's and crossing the t's,"" Gignac said. ""Everything has been set. We just don't know the details.""
But a source close to the negotiations said he understood that the two companies did not have a deal and were trying to get a deadline extension from the Indonesian government.
The latest deadline is the second the two companies missed. They let a deadline at the end of November slip by too, sources said.
Possible stumbling blocks in the talks include price, how to pay for the deal and a series of threatened lawsuits over Bre-X's claims, analysts said.
Waiting to pounce on the deposit if the Indonesian government does open the door to outside bidding is another North American gold giant -- Placer Dome Inc., which seemed to be positioning itself in case the Barrick, Bre-X talks fail.
""I don't think today's deadline had any great significance,"" Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver, British Columbia. He added that the company still hoped to be allowed to form a partnership with Bre-X to develop Busang.
""We're not discouraged. It's going to be a long process,"" he said.
Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp. also expressed an interest in Busang, which is located deep in the jungle in East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.

2,"Weak metals prices will undermine third-quarter earnings for many North American metals producers, analysts surveyed by Reuters said.
""In most cases, we'll see they're going to be down, either year over year or quarter over quarter,"" said Manford Mallory, analyst for Research Capital. ""Metal prices are down a long way and volumes in some cases are down too. The conditions are not as good as they were a year ago.""
Copper is in the doldrums after having fallen sharply since mid-June, while nickel and aluminum have slid steadily.  
Gold has been anemic, hovering around US$380 an ounce.
""It's not going to be a buoyant trend,"" Mallory said. ""Most of them are going to be reporting profits, but there will be a few losses as well.""
Earnings in the mining sector were disappointing in the first quarter and dropped off in the second quarter when the copper scandal at Japan's Sumitomo Corp sent base metals downward.
The third quarter will be even worse, said base metals analyst David Davidson with Wood Gundy. He estimated earnings would be 10 to 15 percent lower than in the second quarter.  
""The more leverage you have to copper, the bigger the loss,"" he said in a phone interview.
Phelps Dodge Corp led the way on Thursday when it reported third-quarter net income of US$80.2 million or US$1.22 a share, compared to US$211.8 million or US$3.03 a share a year earlier.
Most large gold companies hedge part of their production, curbing their exposure to the low gold prices of the third quarter this year, said Davidson.
""But those who haven't much in the way of hedging are certainly suffering in the market,"" said Mallory.  
Investors should keep their eyes on Inco Ltd, said Davidson, who predicted ""the earnings are not going to be great.""
""You're going to have the impact of diluted earnings with the Diamond Fields Resources purchase,"" he said. Inco, the western world's largest nickel producer, completed the C$4.3 billion takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Ltd in August.
The takeover, along with a 10-day lockout at its Thompson, Manitoba facility and a smelter out of commission in Indonesia, will hurt earnings.

21,"China on Thursday hinted at ethnic unrest in Moslem Xinjiang as a senior official called for unity in the western region that was rocked by separatist bomb attacks last week.
""Xinjiang ...must further improve ethnic unity, protect social stability and do a better job of building up Xinjiang,"" the official People's Daily quoted Vice-Premier Li Lanqing as saying.
Li made no direct reference to the series of deadly bombings in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi on February 25, the day Beijing held funeral rites for late leader Deng Xiaoping.
Li's remarks to Xinjiang delegates at the National People's Congress, or parliament, were one of the few signs in the national media that the region had once again been shaken by ethnic unrest.
Three bombs hidden on public buses blew up within minutes of each other in Urumqi in an apparently coordinated attack. A fourth bomb failed to explode.
The Xinjiang Daily said on Wednesday that authorities had arrested several people suspected of planting the bombs and of selling detonators used in the attacks that killed nine people and wounded 74.
Police were interrogating the suspects and had launched a hunt for others still at large, the regional newspaper said.
Official media outside the region ignored the incident.
Parliament's vice-chairman Wang Hanbin on Thursday introduced revisions to China's criminal law setting stiffer punishment for stirring up ethnic hatred and making it a capital crime to use race or religion to endanger state security.
""People in some places are stirring up hatred among ethnic groups in an attempt to undermine unity among them,"" Wang told parliament.
In early February, an anti-Chinese riot erupted in Yining, about 50 km (31 miles) from Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan. Chinese officials said nine people were killed.
The riot was one of the largest, most violent demonstrations for independence in Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.
Moslem separatists say they want to set up an independent ""East Turkestan"" in Xinjiang, home to many Turkic-speaking people such as the Uighur ethnic minority.
Exiled Uighur nationalists in neighbouring Kazakhstan on Tuesday claimed responsibility for the latest attacks.
Beijing, unnerved by the spectre of turmoil along its borders, had put the Lanzhou Military Region, which oversees Xinjiang, on alert against further unrest, Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily newspaper said on Wednesday.

21,"Chinese authorities have imposed a curfew on a town in the mainly Moslem region of northwestern Xinjiang after at least 10 people were killed in a separatist riot last week, officials and local residents said on Monday.
At least 10 people were killed and many wounded last Wednesday when 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining, smashing cars, burning shops and beating up Han Chinese to protest against Beijing rule.
""Both Han Chinese and Uighurs were killed or injured,"" a propaganda official said by telephone from Yining in the near the border with Kazakhstan.
A Chinese source with close links to the government said the separatist riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang, where Moslems are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up just 38 percent of the population.
""A circular has been issued and broadcast on television ordering people not to go out after dark,"" said one local resident, a Han Chinese. ""We don't go out after the sun sets. There is a curfew every night.""
Local officials described the riot as a small incident fuelled by unidentified ""foreign hostile forces"" and refused to say how many people had been killed or injured.
However, the Chinese source said at least 10 people had been killed, including one police officer, and many wounded and arrested.
""One police officer was stabbed to death,"" said the source, who declined to be further identified.
The Hong Kong-based Ming Pao newspaper said rioters set fire to the bodies of those killed. About 100 were wounded, it said.
The rioters attacked ethnic Han Chinese on sight, smashed cars and set fire to shops, forcing local authorities to send out about 1,000 police and paramilitary People's Armed Police to quell the riot, one Han resident said.
""They said they wanted the Han out of Xinjiang,"" he said.
The riot erupted after a Chinese policeman tried to arrest a man of the ethnic Uighur minority, the Chinese source said.
""The police tried to arrest a Uighur criminal suspect but the suspect and his family resisted arrest,"" the source told Reuters by telephone.
""The scene attracted neighbours and onlookers and the crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and turned into rioting,"" he said. ""The police were called in and fired teargas to dispel the crowd.""
The demonstrators, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, had marched on a government building and police had asked them to disperse, said the propaganda official in Yining, about 700 km (440 miles) northwest of the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi.
""There was a demonstration and they shouted slogans calling for Han Chinese to be driven out of Xinjiang and for Xinjiang to be split from the motherland,"" he said, adding that the rioters had ""used the pretext of religion"".
The festival to mark the end of Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting, fell at the weekend, overlapping with China's celebration of the biggest holiday in its calendar, the lunar new year, last Friday.
Xinjiang, considered by many Chinese a wild frontier territory, has a long history of ethnic clashes between the native population of mainly Moslem ethnic minorities and the ruling Han Chinese.

21,"Xujiachong village in central China's Hubei province is nestled in a lush, narrow valley dotted with whitewashed concrete houses, small cabbage patches and freshwater fish ponds.
Ruddy-cheeked children peer out of ill-lit doorways while farmers steer belching tractors along dirt roads lined with orange trees, their verdant branches heavy with the bright, tart fruit.
Xujiachong is much like any other village in China, except that it is scheduled to be wiped off the map by the end of next year.
The village of 2,480 people is just one of hundreds of towns and hamlets that will be flooded by the silt-laden waters of the Yangtze river when the mighty waterway is diverted in November 1997 as part of the giant Three Gorges dam project.
""The total number of people to be relocated under the Three Gorges project, those in submerged areas, is now 840,000,"" said Wang Jiazhu, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Co that is building the mammoth dam.
""We are estimating there could be a million or 1.2 million at most, taking into account the population increase during the 17 years of construction,"" Wang said.
In Yichang county, site of the future dam, more than 12,300 people have been resettled from the sprawling construction site that flanks the broad, snaking river, said Wang Jiangyi, deputy director of the Yichang Resettlement Bureau.
Evacuation of the giant reservoir area -- to cover more than 600 square km (230 square miles) -- began in 1994 and will involve moving about 100,000 people from Yichang county alone, Wang Jiangyi said.
LEAVING ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS
The fates of hundreds of thousands of households in Hubei and neighbouring Sichuan province were sealed in 1992 when Beijing ended seven decades of debate to give the green light to start work on the gargantuan dam that is to harness the power of the world's third longest river.
Beijing hopes the project, to be completed in the year 2009, will help to power China's economic charge in the 21st century and bring an end to disastrous flooding that has claimed the lives of more than 300,000 people in this century alone.
Officials say they have run into opposition from many local residents unwilling to abandon their ancestral homes and traditional lifestyles.
""There are residents who aren't willing to move,"" said Wang Kaidong, village chief of Xujiachong, which is just two km (1.2 miles) from the dam site.
""It is understandable that they don't want to leave the homes their families have occupied for generations,"" she said.
IDEOLOGICAL WEAPONS AND CASH CARROTS
Communist Party officials have tried to combat anti-relocation sentiment by preaching traditional communist values of self-sacrifice while holding out cash and material incentives.
""The magic weapon of our party is ideological work,"" said Wang Kaidong. ""We talk face to face with residents about the resettlement policies and compensation standards.""
Of the project's estimated 204 billion yuan ($24.6 billion) cost, about 40 billion yuan has been earmarked to finance the resettlement, said He Gong, a deputy general manager of the Three Gorges Development Co.
Government work teams have fanned out through the countryside offering compensation to residents based on the size and quality of their houses and farms that will be committed to the watery mass grave.
Total compensation for each family ranges from 30,000 to 80,000 yuan and those being resettled to rural areas are to receive parcels of land to build new houses on, Wang Jiangyi of the resettlement bureau said.
Blocks of apartment buildings have sprung up to house those moving into urban areas to be employed in factories or tertiary industries, Wang Jiangyi said.
Relocated families will also enjoy preferential charges for electricity, water and road use and will be allowed to make two moving trips free of charge, Wang Jiangyi said.
If ethical campaigns and cash rewards failed to convince the stubborn to pack up, authorities could still resort to the force of law, Wang said.
""In the resettlement process, if there is any case of... disrupting the public order that prevents the process from proceeding smoothly...it will be dealt with in accordance with punitive public security regulations,"" he said.

""We don't dare to go out,"" said a Han businessman, adding that Yining was rocked by a similar, smaller riot in August.
Officials described the riot as a small incident fuelled by ""foreign hostile forces"" and refused to say how many people were killed or wounded. Yining is 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.

Xinjiang, considered by many Chinese as a wild frontier territory, has a long history of ethnic clashes between the native population of mainly Moslem ethnic minorities and the ruling Han Chinese.
Xinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after a series of violent clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.
Last May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.

""At least 20 ethnic Uighurs have been arrested...but the real number may be even higher because we have no information whether new arrests took place last night,"" Kakharman Khozhamberdi, head of a local Uighur association, told Reuters in Almaty.

21,"China's listed companies must work to increase transparency and improve asset valuation if the country's fledgling markets are to gain global prominence, a top U.S. securities official said in Beijing on Tuesday.
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said he stressed in meetings with Chinese officials the need for frank disclosure of company data as a crucial step in boosting investor confidence in Chinese firms.
""I mentioned in every meeting over and over and over again the importance of transparency,"" Levitt told reporters.
""That's something that we can't emphasise enough: transparency, transparency, transparency,"" said Levitt, who is on a seven-day visit to China.
Officials in Chinese listed firms often saw the need for transparency but many were reluctant to disclose company data out of fears that such frankness would profit the competition, Levitt said.
Chinese public firms needed to think of shareholders as owners of the company rather than as impediments to progress, he said.
Levitt said he had urged the Chinese to swallow the bitter medicine of improved disclosure, effective regulation and cracking down on corruption to bolster investor confidence in what many businessmen were eyeing as a promising market.
""Their markets, just like every other market in the world, will be no better than public confidence is in that market,"" Levitt said.
Levitt said one of Beijing's most pressing tasks would be to draft a securities law that would serve as a guidepost for companies as well as regulatory agencies.
""The thing that business abhors more than anything else is uncertainty, or a lack of clarity,"" Levitt said.
The lacklustre performance of Chinese companies that had listed on the New York Stock Exchange reflected a lack of investor confidence in Chinese accounting methods and asset valuation systems, he said.
""The process of evaluating assets in China is an uncertain process that concerns many investors,"" Levitt said.
Many Chinese officials had been deeply disappointed by the slack overseas performance of Chinese firms, prompting a two-year pause in the process of nurturing of Chinese financial markets, he said.
""The Chinese over the past 12 to 18 months have been inner-directed, looking at the system, looking at the process and asking themselves what went wrong,"" he said, adding that reform had to continue.
""I tried to encourage everyone I talked to to stay the course, that the stakes were too high to turn around,"" Levitt said.
""This is a road that, once started on, there really is no turning back.""

21,"China confirmed on Tuesday that veteran dissident Wang Xizhe had fled the country, accused him of crossing the border illegally and said Chinese authorities were pursuing those who helped him.
""Concerning the question of Wang Xizhe, this is a case of illegally and secretly crossing the border,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing.
""The judicial authorities are currently pursuing the legal responsibilities of Wang Xizhe and the plotters,"" Shen said, apparently implying that Wang had help when he fled to Hong Kong last week.
Wang, 46, one of China's most vocal advocates of democracy for more than two decades, escaped to Hong Kong just days after a fellow activist in Beijing was condemned to a labour camp for three years.
""We hope that countries concerned will not have the slightest ambiguity in cracking down on illegal and secret immigration,"" Shen said.
Wang has been missing from his home in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong that abuts Hong Kong since fellow pro-democracy activist Liu Xiaobo was arrested in Beijing last Tuesday and ordered to serve three years in a labour camp.
He is reported to be seeking asylum in the United States but Shen said China had received no official confirmation that Wang had sought refuge there.
""We have not yet seen any action by the United States,"" Shen said, adding that Beijing would watch Wang's case closely.
""The governments of some countries, including the United States, should carry out what they have always stressed, namely their stand to crack down on illegal immigration,"" he said.
Wang and Liu penned a daring statement last month accusing the ruling Communist Party of reneging on a 1945 pledge to grant freedom of the press and to allow people to form political parties and stage demonstrations.
The two urged the impeachment of Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin for violating the constitution by saying the army should answer only to the party rather than to the state.
Wang would be the second Chinese dissident to flee to the United States via Hong Kong this year. Activist Liu Gang fled to Hong Kong last May and has since found asylum in the United States.
Wang was first jailed in 1974 on charges of sedition for putting up a wall poster advocating democracy in China. He was paroled in 1993 after serving 12 years of a 14-year sentence and stripped of his civil rights for five years.
The report of Wang's flight abroad comes amid a renewed crackdown on China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
Liu Gang, who spent six years in prison as a leader of the 1989 student-led demonstrations for more democracy, fled to the United States last May after months of police harassment at his home in the northeastern province of Liaoning.
Detained dissident and former leader of the 1989 protests Wang Dan faces the capital charge in Beijing of plotting to subvert the government based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad.
Wang Dan, detained since May 1995, has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government -- a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of 10 years in prison.
Wang Dan had defied persistent police surveillance and harassment to take part in a bold appeal in May 1995 to Beijing for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 student protests.

21,"Talks between South Korea and China have failed to resolve the fate of a senior North Korean defector holed up for an eighth day in Seoul's mission in Beijing, Seoul officials said on Wednesday.
The impasse came despite signals from the Stalinist North that it might be ready to give up Pyongyang ideologue Hwang Jang-yop without a fight.
""Unfortunately, we have not made any real progress in our talks with China,"" South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said of the drama centred on Hwang, who has sought asylum in Seoul's heavily-guarded consular compound in Beijing.
Lee denied a report by Japan's Yomiuri newspaper that China and South Korea had basically agreed that Hwang could leave Beijing for asylum in South Korea as early as this week.
The newspaper said Beijing had demanded a meeting with Hwang to confirm his desire to defect and had insisted on a signed promise from South Korean President Kim Young-sam pledging not to use the incident for political gain.
""It is too early to talk about when Hwang could leave Beijing,"" Lee said in Seoul.
South Korean officials in Beijing said talks with Chinese officials were still going on but declined to comment on the content of the negotiations, saying only that a solution was expected to take some time.
""We haven't got any results so far,"" embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik said. Embassy officials had not met counterparts from the North, he said.
China had insisted Hwang's case be resolved through dialogue between rivals South and North, a Seoul Foreign Ministry official said.
""We are telling the Chinese that there's no dialogue channel and it is impossible to resolve a sensitive defection issue in direct talks with the North,"" said the official, who asked not to be identified.
""But with North Korea changing its attitude, we hope there will be progress in our negotiations,"" the official said.
The Stalinist North has hinted it may be ready to give up attempts to win back Hwang, ranked 24th in the Pyongyang hierarchy and architect of its governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance.
North Korean leader King Jong-il appeared to indicate Pyongyang's less hardline approach when he was quoted by state radio on Tuesday as saying ""cowards"" should get out.
Another Japanese newspaper reported that a top North Korean official visiting Beijing had said Pyongyang would not fight the defection of Hwang, who sought refuge in Seoul's Beijing mission last Wednesday.
China, dragged as an unwilling third party into the latest crisis in the world's last Cold War standoff, has repeated its plea to both countries to act with restraint to resolve the affair.
Beijing is in a quandary over how to usher Hwang out of China without angering an old communist comrade or a new capitalist friend.
China appeared nervous about Pyongyang's intentions, sending three armoured personnel carriers, a crowd control truck and armed police to guard the sedate streets around the mission while officials seek an end to the impasse.

21,"Chinese police cordoned off a South Korean embassy compound on Thursday and North Korean diplomats lurked outside as an official from Seoul met the most senior North Korean to defect from the Stalinist state.
But Beijing officials, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided meeting Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korean Foreign Yoo Chong-ha, South Korean sources said.
South Korean embassy officials had earlier said the Seoul Foreign Ministry envoy was meeting Chinese officials to discuss the fate of the defector, Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Chinese police blocked streets to Seoul's consular section in the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, and embassy officials said Hwang and his assistant were inside.
Hwang, 73, is one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, and the highest ranking official from the world's last Stalinist state to seek asylum in the South.
Kim met Hwang in the consular office, South Korean sources said. No other details were available.
China avoided direct comment after finding itself in the eye of a diplomatic storm involving its old communist comrade and a new commercial ally and major source of investment, choosing instead to appeal for calm.
""Regarding the transit through Beijing by Hwang Jang-yop, we were not notified in advance,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, in a signal of China's anger.
""We hope the parties concerned can deal with this matter calmly and on the basis of the overall circumstances, and appropriately handle this to safeguard the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula,"" the spokesman added.
Previous, low-profile defectors from the North have made their way quietly through China, apparently after making contact with the South Korean embassy, but Seoul did not publicise their journey until they were out of China.
Seoul announced Hwang's defection on Wednesday.
South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha was to meet his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen in Singapore on Friday morning at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) to discuss the diplomatic crisis.
In a sign of the suspicion that underscores dealings between North and South, South Korean embassy officials accused North Koreans of trying to force their way into the consular office and called for Chinese police protection.
Diplomats from Pyongyang sat in parked cars outside the consular compound and waited outside the embassy, watching from behind police cordons.
""Last night, North Korean people who we believe were from the embassy tried to enter our consular section,"" embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik told reporters. Chinese police on guard prevented the North Koreans from entering, he said.
""We have asked the Chinese government to protect our embassy compound... against North Koreans and any unexpected (incidents),"" he said.
He dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, had been kidnapped by the South, saying Hwang had arrived in a taxi and voluntarily sought asylum.
North Korean diplomats stood by the kidnapping charge.
""I think South Korea has kidnapped these two officials,"" said one of several North Korean officials waiting in the office tower housing Seoul's embassy. ""The impossible has happened.""
""We expect that the Chinese side will take appropriate measures in this regard,"" a North Korean official said.
South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.

21,"North Korea expects a shortfall of two million tonnes of grain next year -- equal to 40 percent of the nation's needs and significantly worse than expected, a Red Cross official said on Monday.
Only a few months ago, aid workers had estimated the food shortage would be 1.5 million tonnes.
""Their shortages are serious...they (North Korean officials) have not been able to meet the daily food ration,"" said Ole Gronning, representative of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.
""This is bad news, really bad news in a country that already doesn't have much now,"" Gronning said by telephone.
He said farmers whose crops had been wiped out by devastating floods in July had eaten about 400,000 tonnes of grain before it came to maturity, adding this would worsen the food shortage this winter.
North Korea has faced the spectre of famine since July after the floods destroyed about 373,000 tonnes of grain, compounding damage from widespread floods in 1995.
Official figures showed North Korea would need 5.5 million tonnes of grain next year, but this year's harvest had yielded just 3.5 million tonnes, Gronning said.
The federation was trying to raise $10.5 million for a new programme to buy grain to stave off hunger for some 140,000 North Koreans badly hit by the floods, he said.
""In some of the villages and the valleys we are now going into, they were working on repairing the damage from the 1995 floods and then they got hit once again,"" he said.
""They have lost everything, including houses, livestock and so on,"" he said.
The summer floods had submerged large tracts of arable land for more than 10 days. Some of that land was now covered in sand and mud and could not be farmed again.
""The second floods left people in a really bad situation,"" Gronning said. ""People will be running out of food in the second half of December.""
The federation would work with the North Korean Red Cross Society to distribute a daily ration of 450 grams (15.75 ounces) of grain and a helping of supplementary foods such as soybeans to each person, he said.
Aid workers would try to provide stricken residents with winter clothes and blankets to brace against winter temperatures that could drop as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, he said.
""Without enough food and without proper heating, these people are really badly off,"" he said.
North Korea, despite its philosophy of self-reliance, cracked open the door to foreign aid last year in the face of looming food shortages.
Gronning said the federation had appealed to member societies in Europe, North America and Japan to donate money urgently needed to start buying grain and clothes.
""Hopefully, we will have the first pledges very, very soon so we can start purchasing,"" he said.

Analysts said the market could slip below 14,800 points before picking up toward the middle of next week as firms release their September earnings reports.
""It looks like we'll have falls for a few sessions, with the first support line at 14,800 points possibly broken,"" said Grzegorz Pindur, an analyst at Bank Staropolski brokerage.
The main market's all-share WIG index closed at 14,920.4 points, up 244.5 points or 1.7 percent from Friday's close.
PRAGUE
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to limp through October, yet to record an advancing session, with little hope in sight for a turnaround as investors shun a market plagued by a lack of transparency.
The PX50 index closed at 542.4 on Friday, down 13.1 points, or 2.36 percent.
""I think the budget first reading passing is too weak a signal but it is definitely positive. There are still structural problems to be solved before investors get more confident in this market,"" said Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings.
Foreign investors have long-complained that Czech capital markets are plagued by weak securities legislation that allows for secretive transactions. An estimated 70 percent of all market activity takes place off-market.
BUDAPEST
The Budapest Stock Exchange closed the week at an all-time high, boosted by the release of some positive macroeconomic figures. On Friday the BUX index closed at 3,639.68 points, up 31.67 from last Friday's close.
""Price rises were not very significant but they may mark the beginning of a modestly bullish trend,"" said Robert Agoston of Daewoo Securities. ""These macroeconomic data triggered price increases.""
Hungary released wide range of macroeconomic data this week, including the central bank's preliminary current account, trade gap, reserve and inflation data, in addition.
BRATISLAVA
The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) also suffered through another week of sluggish trading, though a jump on Friday appeared to bear out broker predictions of signs that activity was gradually reviving.
The 12-share SAX index fell through the 200 level at mid-week, but then rebounded slightly to close at 203.82 points on Friday, up from Monday's open at 200.32 points.
""We have witnessed some fresh players on our market over the past few days, and the good thing is that the ratio between foreign and domestic investor seems to be well-balanced,"" said Libor Briska of Creditanstalt.
BUCHAREST
Thin interest from retail investors, who dominate the bourse, drove most share prices down this week.
Two independent indices fell to year-lows at both weekly sessions as investors awaited fresh listings to the currently traded 13 stocks.
Last week, the bourse said 11 companies had applied for listing but did not say when they would join trading.
The VAB index fell 1.5 percent to 291.7 points on Thursday and the BIG index dipped 1.6 percent to 289.98 points.
SOFIA
Two corporate issues traded higher on the Bulgarian stock market this week amid low investor interest.
The 13-share Reuter All Bulgaria Stock Index (RABSI) closed at 41.28 points, up 0.26 from last Thursday due to the rise of RIF' third issue and TBS Hotels second issue.
TIRANA
Tirana's Stock Exchange this week recorded a 100 million leks transaction in 364-day treasury bills on Monday but no bonds changed hands on Thursday.
The Savings Bank sold 100 million leks worth of 364-day T-Bills to the National Commercial Bank on Monday, the first of Tirana's Stock Exchange (TSE) two weekly sessions.
The finance ministry on Thursday offered 800 million leks worth of 91-day t-bills, 400 million leks of 182-day t-bills and one billion leks in 364-day t-bills.
ZAGREB
Croatian stocks forged ahead throughout the week, ending mixed on Friday as selected hoteliers closed slightly lower after recording new highs during the week. Traders said growing supply will stabilise prices next week.
LJUBLJANA
Slovenian shares jumped 18.5 percent this week, pushing the index up 202.6 points to 1,299.70 as investors snapped up shares of newly-privatised companies. Traders said the market was likely to continue its recent bull run.

13,"Czechs cold-shouldered their newly-created Senate on Saturday, turning out in record low numbers for elections which were supposed to be a key test for the minority government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
The apathy suggested that the real winners might not be Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate elections and told fellow Czechs to follow suit.
Unofficial figures from the two-day first round, which ended on Saturday, indicated that turnout would be well under 40 percent, by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism.
Opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted that turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23.
""I think that no party can be happy with the low election turnout, because people that don't turn out for the Senate elections are giving up their civic rights, the right to vote, the right to decide,"" Zeman told reporters.
No national figures were available immediately after the polls closed at 2.00 p.m. (1300 GMT).
But preliminary, unofficial data from some of the 81 constituencies showed Klaus's centre-right ODS doing well against a bleak background on turnout.
In the Western city of Plzen, turnout was just 36 percent with the ODS candidate expected to face a Social Democrat in the second round, the Czech news agency CTK reported.
If no candidate wins more than half the vote in the first round, the top two candidates go through to the runoff.
In the northern mining town of Most, turnout was 26 percent with the ODS candidate leading trade union leader Richard Falbr, who is running for the Social Democrats.
Pundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority last June.
But the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek.
Sladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it ""would be lazy, useless and expensive"".
Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.

13,"The Prague Stock Exchange on Tuesday, buoyed by financial sector share gains, continued to rebounds from its recent slump, closing higher for the third consecutive session.
Komercni Banka, IPB, Ceska Sporitelna and Zivnostenska Banka all gained ground as the PX50 index edged up 2.5 points, or 0.47 percent, to 537.1.
The Reuters RPIX index, measuring the seven continuously- traded equity issues on the bourse, climbed five points to 1,095.
Overall, 188 shares rose on the day, while 121 lost and 74 held steady. Total volume was 701,356 shares on turnover of 721.14 million crowns.
For IPB, which rose 15 crowns to 331, it was the second consecutive five percent gain, the maximum allowed by the bourse in a session, after the government said it would be the first of the big four banks to undergo privatisation.
On Friday, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik gave investors the signal they had been looking for when he said that a strong foreign strategic partner would be the most likely beneficiary of any sell off.
Since the announcement, Nomura and ING Bank have been rumoured as the frontrunners in any bid to participate in the selloff. The government holds about a 30 percent stake in IPB.
""If you were to bring in a foreign partner such as the caliber of the two banks mentioned, that addresses questions that have been hovering around IPB on its perceived lack of corporate structure and transparency,"" said Jay King of Wood and Company.
The bank has been widely-criticsed for being the least transparent of the four major Czech banks in its dealings, especially a recent spending spree that has seen it quietly buy large stakes in several firms.
Several utilities also fared well at the fixing, with Stredoceska Energetika, Prazska Teplarenska, Severomoravksa Energetika, Jihomoravska Energetika and Elektrarny Opatovice all rising.

13,"Third seed Boris Becker on Thursday withdrew from the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open due to a recurring injury to his right wrist.
Becker, who tore a ligament in the wrist during a third round match at this year's Wimbledon, trained on Thursday morning, but afterward complained of pain in his wrist.
He later told ATP officials that he would not play his second round match against Czech Martin Damm later on Thursday.
""Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,"" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw told Reuters. He did not elaborate.
On Wednesday evening, Becker cruised to an easy 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein.
During the match he held his wrist several times, and appeared to be favouring it again at practice on Thursday morning. Becker immediately left the training court for his hotel. He was not available for comment
""I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow,"" Becker said after the match on Wednesday.
The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the wrist forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.
Becker's withdrawal puts a serious dent in the 28 year old's plans to qualify for a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hannover.
It also comes as a blow to tournament organisers. Though he was only ranked third in the tournament behind top seed Goran Ivanisevic and Ferreira, it was clear most of the tickets sold were by fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the German.
Barely 1,000 fans came out to watch Ivanisevic's first round match against world number 42 Adrian Voinea. In contrast, a tournament record crowd of some 10,000 watched Becker defeat the Fetterlien, ranked 156 in the world.

13,"Britain's Tim Henman emerged on Friday as the only seed in the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open semifinals.
Seventh-ranked Henman overcame second seed Wayne Ferreira 6-4 6-3.
But fifth seed Todd Martin was edged out by Germany's David Prinosil 7-6 7-6 and sixth seed Michael Stich lost to Czech Martin Damm 5-7 6-4 6-4.
Czech Petr Korda completed the final four with his 6-1 6-0 demolition of Davis Cup team mate Jiri Novak and now faces another Davis Cup player in Damm. Henman plays Prinosil in Saturday's other semifinal.
Reigning Ostrava champion Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, never looked comfortable against Henman, the more aggressive of the two for most of the match.
He failed to gain a single break point all match while the Briton broke serve late in both sets.
Henman's win avenged his loss to the South African in Toronto earlier this year, and he said he had taken notes from that match on to court on Friday.
""In Toronto, Ferreira was dictating the points -- serving very well and hitting forehands very well -- so today I tried to be very aggressive and, when I had an opportunity, move forward,"" said Henman, ranked 26 in the world.
Local favourite Damm, a finalist at the Beijing Open last week, spoiled Stich's 28th birthday. After losing the first set the Czech scored crucial breaks in the ninth game of the final two sets.
For Martin, defeat was especially painful as he could have gained valuable ground on Ferreira in the race for the final spot at the ATP Tour championship in Hanover at the end of the season.
The American currently sits 199 points behind the South African. A semifinal berth would have eaten 37 points out of that lead while a place in the finals would have almost halved Ferreira's advantage.
Prinosil, ranked 58th in the world, profited from a Martin double fault at 5-5 in the first set tiebreak and took a 4-0 lead in the second set tiebreak on the way to sealing victory.
Martin said: ""I realise I didn't help my cause at all but we've got two of the biggest tournaments coming up and I think whoever does really well in those events should probably play themselves into a position at Hanover.""
Martin, Stich and Ferreira both appear next week in Stuttgart, where the winner gains 370 Tour points, 200 more than the winner here.
The German tournament's organisers said on Friday they expect Boris Becker will be fit to play, despite a wrist injury which forced him to retire here.
In a move to accommodate Becker, his first round match has been put back to Wednesday.

13,"The Czech Republic and Spain played out a scoreless draw in their World Cup group six qualifier on Wednesday, in a match that never lived up to expectations.
The Czechs were facing their first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final, while Real Madrid's teenage striker Raul was looking to spark a depleted Spanish attack in his first full international.
Both sides opened their World Cup campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group, Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0.
But Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither team could afford to give ground in Prague.
Like two heavyweights feeling each other out in the early rounds, both teams started tentatively, waiting to pounce on the other's mistakes.
The Spaniard's were the first to flinch when Kaiserslautern striker Pavel Kuka's cross found an unmarked Karel Poborsky just outside the crease. But the Manchester United midfielder failed to control the ball, wasting what would turn out be one of the game's few good scoring chances.
Next it was the Czechs turn to falter. Newcastle United goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek, winning his first cap in over a year, tried to clear the ball, but hit attacker Alfonso Perez and watched helplessly as it rolled just wide of the net.
The Czechs picked up their play in the second half, putting Spain on their heels for the rest of the game.
""I don't think we lost points tonight because they are such an excellent team. They played strongly in the defence and its too bad we missed out on the two great chances we had,"" said Czech striker Patrik Berger.
Teams:
Czech Republic: 1-Pavel Srnicek, 2-Radoslav Latal, 3-Jan Suchoparek, 4-Pavel Nedved (15-Martin Frydek, 86th), 5-Miroslav Kadlec, 6-Michal Hornak, 7-Jiri Nemec, 8-Karel Poborsky (17-Vladimir Smicer, 58th), 9-Pavel Kuka, 10-Patrik Berger, 11-Radek Bejbl

13,"The Czech trade deficit jumped sharply in October, rising nearly 16 billion crowns ($600 million), but analysts were not alarmed by the rise, which was in line with their full year forecasts.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Tuesday the trade gap for the first 10 months of the year hit a record 125.5 billion crowns, up from a revised 109.6 billion crown shortfall for January-September.
The CSU, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and some analysts have predicted the deficit -- inflated by economic slowdown with the country's main trading partner, Germany -- will finish the year at a record 150-160 billion crowns.
""The figures are developing according to forecasts. It's clear that the year-end deficit will be 150-160 billion crowns,"" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka.
""I'm not surprised by the jump since the economic revival of Germany will only show up in export growth in the first half of next year, not in one or two months,"" he added.
The CSU said in a statement that imports in the first ten months of the year rose by 14.4 percent year-on-year, down from 15.2 percent in the first nine months, while exports rose by 5.2 percent after a 5.9 percent increase in January-September.
It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, growing by 19.1 percent year- on-year and accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports.
Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector because the imports were needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for exporting.
""The trend seems unchanged. The financing of future economic growth is being done with imports, especially in the heavy machinery sector,"" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings said.
Martin Kupka of Patria Finance added -- ""The country is still clamouring for machinery and raw materials which are necessary for industrial restructuring.""
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, a monetarist-economist, has said the record trade deficit is ""not tragic"", adding it has come partly from a temporary foreign investment wave.
The Czech crown reacted indifferently to the trade figures on Tuesday, hovering around three percent above its dollar/mark basket parity, where it was for most of Monday.
The crown was trading at 26.919 to the dollar at 1230 local time (1130 GMT).
The rate implies a deviation from the midpoint of the currency basket of +3.09 percent, after the central bank's fixing earlier on Tuesday at +3.00 percent.
""The market is neither alarmed nor pleased with the figure. If the deficit hits the forecast level, I doubt we will see any significant change in the currency's value,"" said one local forex dealer.

13,"The fall in the Czech trade deficit to 10.5 billion crowns in September from 14.5 billion in August buoyed market sentiment, and the goods imported show industrial restructuring is on track, analysts said on Thursday.
Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) data released earlier showed the January-September trade shortfall hit an all-time high of 110.7 billion crowns, far surpassing the full 1995 deficit of 95.7 billion crowns.
But the September shortfall, the smallest one-month deficit this year, surprised analysts, who had forecast on average a gap of 13 to 15 billion crowns.
""I'm happily surprised. I think it's a relatively optimistic figure, though not so good as to make us revise our full year forecast,"" said Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance, which has forecast a 150-160 billion crown deficit at year-end.
The CSU said September imports rose 15.2 percent year-on-year, the same as in August, while exports rose 5.9 percent after a 6.4 percent increase in August.
It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports.
Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector as these imports are needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for export.
The crown also reacted positively, dipping slightly on the release of the figures but quickly regaining its losses as the market digested the statistics.
The crown was trading at 26.939 to the dollar at 0840 GMT after opening at 26.945. The rate implies a deviation from the midpoint of the currency basket of +2.87 percent, after the central bank's Wednesday fixing at +2.80 percent.
""The market is pleased with the figures for sure, they seem to bear out estimates that slowly, the structure and size of the deficit is getting better,"" said one local forex dealer.
"" don't think the crown itself will benefit too much from the numbers, but it certainly should not weaken,"" he added.

13,"Boris Becker withdrew from the Czech Indoor Open on Thursday because of a recurring wrist injury, while top seed Goran Ivanisevic crashed out to Czech Petr Korda 7-6 6-2.
Becker, who tore a ligament in his right wrist at the Wimbledon championships this year, was in pain after training and dropped out of his scheduled second round match against Czech Martin Damm.
""Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,"" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw said.
On Wednesday Becker had held his wrist several times during his 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein.
The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month but the injury forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.
Becker's absence has set back his bid for a record 12th appearance at the season-ending ATP Tour championship. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira for the eighth and final spot.
Ivanisevic, who has already qualified for the tour finale, lives and dies by the serve. 
But he was outgunned by Korda who served 10 aces and only one double fault, while Ivanisevic managed only nine aces along with five double faults.
""He surprised me the way he played, he served well and returned very well. I double-faulted at 5-5 in the tie break which hurt,"" said Ivanisevic.
""I didn't return well, I didn't take any chances on his second serve. I didn't know whether to stay back or come in and when you're not sure what to do then it's no good.""
Second seed Ferreira scraped through to the quarter-finals with a 7-6 5-7 7-5 victory over Dutch qualifier Joost Winnink.
Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, was stretched to the limit by Winnink. Their absorbing baseline battle ended in the 12th game of the deciding set when Winnink's backhand let him down on three successive occasions.

30,"Russia's oil sector, fresh from its smallest fall in output after a decade of plunging, may find it tough to keep up the momentum in the coming years, officials and analysts said on Thursday.
""Analysts' consensus is that production will not pick up before 1999 or 2000,"" said Elena Merkoulova, Russian energy analyst at Salomon Brothers in London.
Output fell two percent to 6.03 million barrels per day last year, its lowest level in three decades, although the drop in percentage terms was the smallest since 1987.
But output from the world's third largest oil producer has fallen again in the first two months of this year to an average 5.60 million bpd. This is two percent lower than year-ago levels.
Some producers have said that total output could be halved by the year 2000 under existing tax regimes.
Analysts believe this is highly unlikely and the era of steep declines appears to be over. But they say the upturn will be rocky and that slippage will continue.
""The drop we saw at the beginning of the year won't continue through the rest of the year,"" said Sintez energy analyst Gennady Vasilyev. He forecast that total 1997 output would edge down one percent from 1996.
But the Fuel and Energy Ministry, citing increasingly scarce cash, high taxes and ageing, less productive wells, fears that stagnation could follow the steep decline.
""In these conditions, the relative stabilisation in energy output achieved in 1996 is only a temporary phenomenon,"" the ministry said.
""It does not offer hopeful grounds for strengthening the slowdown in the rate of decline needed for the short term development programme to 2000,"" it said in its latest InfoTEK bulletin.
Around 26 percent of Russia's 139,000 wells are not operating and existing tax regimes make many of them unprofitable to rehabilitate. Exploration drilling fell by a third in 1996.
""Such cuts in the sector's production potential pose a threat to the medium-term stabilisation programme to 2000,"" the ministry said.
Analysts said producers saw few reasons to invest what little cash they had in production when the government was pushing them to supply more crude to domestic refineries and to deliver oil products to the ailing farm sector.
Investment by oil firms in production shrank 26 percent last year, with YUKOS, Russia's second largest oil producer, cutting investment by half. A third of oil companies finished 1996 in the red.
Russia's draft Tax Code may make special provisions for producers, who pay around 53 percent of the wholesale price of each barrel of oil in taxes and tariffs. Boosting output depends upon lower taxes and tariffs, they say.
""The easy-to-recover reserves have been depleted, and it is going to take a lot of money and technology to get the other reserves,"" Merkoulova said. ""No one wants to produce a lot until the excise tariff on production is resolved.""

30,"A big diamond deal between Russia and De Beers has been caught up in political manoeuverings in Moscow. Bickering ministries and a shake-up in the leadership of the Russian diamond industry are conspiring to delay a crucial agreement.
Senior officials on both sides declined on Tuesday to predict when the government would sign the long-delayed deal, whose absence has kept world gem markets on edge.
Russian officials said Moscow and De Beers could head into 1997 with no formal contract signed.
Vladimir Piskunov, head of the Industry Ministry's new precious metals and stones section, said the government had been poring over a draft deal for at least a month since it said it was about ready to sign it and said unspecified pricing issues needed more scrutiny.
""Yes, I will admit that this (a final signing) could drag out into 1997,"" Piskunov said after a news conference.
De Beers representatives in Moscow declined to comment, with one saying, ""As we've told you, when we have something to tell you, we'll tell you.""
A spokesman for Almazy Rossii-Sakha, or ARS, De Beers' partner in the deal and Russia's diamond producer and sole legal exporter, said big shake-ups over 1996 in Russia's diamond industry were behind the delay.
""Do you want to know my opinion -- it's that there are some battles going on,"" said ARS spokesman Valentin Logunov.
De Beers controls about three quarters of the world diamond market and Russia accounts for about 25 percent of all the gems De Beers sells, so delays to the deal have worried gem watchers.
ARS produces nearly all of Russia's diamonds and had sales of $1.38 billion last year.
Piskunov said Moscow was committed to working with De Beers and that leaving the cartel was out of the question -- but he admitted negotiations had dragged on for over a year because of power struggles in Moscow.
""Some have said that we don't need this agreement, but time is playing against us,"" he said. ""There are strict rules on this market and you have to play by them.""
Asked if Russia could leave the cartel, he said, ""No, no.""
Piskunov said the Finance Ministry was struggling with the Industry Ministry for influence over diamond production, while federal budget drafters were arguing with the diamond-rich regions over their cut from taxes paid on exported gems.
De Beers has seen Russia's diamond sector go through turmoil this year, when President Boris Yeltsin disbanded one of its former negotiating partners, the State Committee for Precious Metals and Stones, and sacked its head, Yevgeny Bychkov.
Now Piskunov's department is wrangling with Goskhran, the Finance Ministry arm that will store and export precious metals and stones. Adding to the muddle is a formal investigation by Russia's tax police into ARS finances.
But Piskunov said the probe and Bychkov were not the fundamental reasons for the delay -- raising questions over just what Moscow objects to in the February memorandum.
""There are other processes involved,"" Piskunov said. ""It's a battle of opposing sides. Russia's diamond industry has always been in the hands of several people.""
He cast a cloud over an agreement De Beers said on Monday it had signed with Russia's Northern Mining-Geological Company Terra to set up a diamond exploration joint venture.
""We principally insist on the position that foreigners should not mine diamonds in Russia,"" he said, adding that Russian law prohibited the publication or sale of geological information on diamond deposits in the northern Arkhangelsk region.

Viktor Khlystun repeated earlier government statements that Russia would produce at least 70 million net tonnes of grain and that Moscow would not need to import wheat this year.
""Seventy million tonnes is the prediction, and this is realistic,"" Khlystun told a news conference. ""But I hope it will be bigger.""
But as he called for a rejection of Soviet-style cheap state credits and handouts of goods to finance food production, he admitted that 70 percent of Russian farms verged on collapse.
Khlystun, just appointed a deputy prime minister and now the beleaguered farm lobby's top cabinet voice, promised to give his all to implement a government programme aimed at stabilising and modestly reforming the sector.
""It's completely obvious the time has come when we cannot just look calmly at a situation in which many farms are falling apart,"" he said, adding that 10-15 percent of farms were chronically broke, lazy and without any vision of the future.
But he said some key changes in Russia's agriculture sector, still one of the world's most inefficient, were in motion.
""A root change has taken place -- peasants now see that selling output is more important than producing it,"" he said, adding that most farms were now joint stock companies and that 30 percent of them were thriving.
Russian grain output has contracted by around 40 percent from earlier peak levels of 115 million tonnes and more, and imports now supply up to half the food market.
But banks are unwilling to lend to farms, which in turn have no money to invest in output as state credits dry up.
Khlystun, saying farmers wanted to sell grain but did not know how, said Moscow would set up a marketing agency to bring suppliers and sellers together to redress a big problem that has fuelled smaller private imports -- regional supply imbalances.
""There can be no return to credits in kind,"" he added, referring to government handouts of inputs to farmers. ""I really hope 1997 will be the year we succeed in setting up a (private) credit system for the agricultural sector.""
But he did not say how troubled plans to introduce a land market -- crucial if farms are to receive commercial bank credits requiring property or other assets as backing -- could win the consent of conservative parliamentary deputies.
When asked about Russia's grain import needs this year, Khlystun said, ""We will not do centralised (government) imports."" Russia would have enough food wheat but private sector purchases of maize would continue.
Russia's net grain harvest last year was 69.3 million tonnes, the second worst on record in three decades and only a notch below Khlystun's output forecast for this year.
Private commodities houses have been importing some grains as the government loosens its grip on the market and Moscow has sought to procure for the army and far-flung regions on a competitive basis.
But some reform efforts, most notably the Federal Food Corporation state buying agency, have flopped in the face of charges of misuse of funds and inefficiency.

30,"Western oil joint ventures in Russia, their hands tied by myriad taxes and the unknown policies of a new energy minister, are finding it tougher than ever to make money, industry sources said on Friday.
""Nothing's really happening on the jv side because they (the Russians) don't have a good investment vehicle,"" said an independent U.S. energy consultant in Moscow. ""And I don't see anything that would suggest a quick turnaround.""
Zarko Stefanovski, an oil analyst at T. Hoare &amp; Co brokerage in London, estimated net revenue on each barrel of oil produced and exported from Russia by joint ventures at about $4.40.
That is after current per-barrel costs of about $2.70 for operations, $2.75 for transport, $2.00 in excise duty on output, $0.65 in pipeline tax, mineral royalties of $1.30 and road and housing taxes of $0.35.
Then comes Russia's 35 percent profits tax, which is revenue, not profit, based.
""The biggest nightmare is having to adjust the budgets meeting after meeting after meeting,"" said a Western oil man, complaining that Russia's taxes changed constantly. ""Morale in the company then falls because we don't get the money to do what we need because the economics are skewed.""
About 40 Western ventures produce and export Russian oil -- but their output, at about 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), is a drop in the bucket of Russia's total 6.2 million bpd.
""The export tax is gone, but these other taxes have more than made up for it,"" added a Western energy consultant in Moscow who works with major U.S. oil companies. ""You can't say across the board everyone's making a profit.""
Joint ventures were thought to be a cheaper, easier and faster way than more complex production-sharing contracts to access Russia, the world's third-largest oil producer, which could hold five percent of the world's proven reserves.
""They have a potential to be a success long-term,"" said Brian Leonard, first deputy director of KomiArcticOil, which groups British Gas Plc with Russia's Komineft and a local geological outfit.
But Zarko said joint ventures would take off only when their bigger cousins, multi-billion dollar production-sharing contracts undertaken by Western majors, get to the output phase -- at least several years down the line.
In the absence of an acceptable legal framework, many ventures plead for Kremlin favours to secure special deals.
Western oil men bow and scrape before ministries and the cabinet on two fronts, the Petroleum Advisory Forum and the Moscow International Petroleum Club, which includes Russian industry executives.
The policies of new Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov remain unclear to oil men and tax changes from other officials have not been forthcoming.
A new threat comes from Russia's State Customs Committee, which says prominent ventures should pay millions of dollars for ""excess"" exports -- including White Nights, a 50-50 venture between Phibro Energy Production Inc and Russian Sidanko's Varyoganneftegaz, and KomiArcticOil.
""We think it's absolute nonsense and are hoping for a resolution to the situation,"" a senior oil executive said.
In the meantime, corporate budgets are constantly revised and oil men are discouraged.
""The environment is certainly very tough and it hasn't gotten any easier,"" said one of the Western consultants.
""A lot are hanging on, hoping to get a stake in the market to get better terms when things change.""
"
30,"Russia's grain crop is proving to be one of its lowest in three decades, prompting trade sources on Monday to speculate that the government could return to world markets for imports to feed the military and remote areas.
The nearly complete 1996 harvest, bucking a trend of increased grain output across the world, weighs in at a gross 74.6 million tonnes, with little high-quality bread wheat and virtually no stocks from last year's disastrous output, which was the worst for more than 30 years.
""The figure is, I think, slightly lower than we expected,"" said a Western agriculture source, commenting on preliminary data published by the State Statistics Committee on Friday.
""It means additional imports.""
The cash-strapped Russian state insisted last year it had long ago left world markets for good.
But Anatoly Manellya, head of agriculture forecasting at the Centre for Economic Trends, a think-tank set up by the Russian government, said the Federal Food Corporation, the state agency responsible for reserves to feed the armed forces and remote towns, might soon be in the international market.
""The Federal Food Corporation is probably going to try to do some deals,"" he said, adding only that it was in preliminary negotiations.
The agency has bought a mere 450,000 tonnes of domestic grain out of the 4.5 million tonnes it plans to buy this year.
""As far as I know, the government is talking about possible imports for us, but I cannot tell you anything more since we merely fulfil government orders and they have not yet told us anything,"" said Corporation deputy director Yuri Lysenko.
Russia's harvest last year was officially 63.4 million tonnes and record-high world grain prices kept traders from importing any significant quantities from beyond the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
This year prices are lower after bumper world harvests, with benchmark Chicago contracts at $3.75 per bushel after a long spell above $5 and a spike to $7.50 in March.
But Russian farmers, mindful of recent high prices, have declined to sell to state reserves -- making government officials jittery over how to feed the soldiers and isolated Arctic cities that cannot depend on the private sector.
""It seems like more and more contracts are being talked, especially in the (Russian) Far East,"" said the Western source, who forecast Russia's total grain imports over the 1996/97 crop marketing year from all sources at five million tonnes.
Andrei Sizov of the private agricultural consultancy SovEcon Ltd recently put the total at six to seven million tonnes.
Allowing for the eight or nine percent that is lost after cleaning, Russia's 1996 net harvest will probably weigh in at a lean 68 to 69 million tonnes -- not much above last year.
Manellya said he had told the cabinet last week that net output would be 69.8 million tonnes.
""This is better than last year, but is still one of the three worst harvests in the last three decades,"" he said.

30,"A battle is shaping up for control of Russia's Fuel and Energy Ministry after the minister resigned, and the losers are likely to be Western firms eyeing deals in the lucrative Russian oil sector, industry sources said on Monday.
The Kremlin has not yet named a replacement for Pyotr Rodionov, who tendered his surprise resignation on Friday, leaving almost no record of substantial achievements after eight months in the job.
But the sources said Moscow, abuzz with talk of possible replacements, was likely to install a person whose priority was domestic oil producers, not Western joint ventures or output-sharing deals dominated by energy multinationals.
""Rodionov didn't have any real feel for the oil sector,"" said one Western source. ""He wasn't a plus or a negative -- he was a nonentity.""
Russian news agencies tipped Alexander Samusev, vice-president of Rosprom-YUKOS, Russia's second largest oil producer, and a former deputy minister in the Fuel and Energy and Finance Ministries, as the likely replacement.
YUKOS and its shareholder, Bank Menatep, declined to comment. Rosprom is an industrial holding firm attached to Menatep.
Sources said First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, a new cabinet reformist in charge of natural monopolies and energy issues, wanted his own unnamed choice in the post.
Either option would install a candidate with market economy sensibilities but also a keen desire to make Russian oil firms the dominant players in the world's third biggest crude producer.
""Having somebody from Menatep run the energy ministry wouldn't be particularly good news for Western companies,"" said a European industry executive.
""I would expect him, if he gets the job, to take a tough line in terms of favouring Russian commercial banks.""
Samusev, seen as a reformer and experienced in the state and private sectors, played a key role in winning oil export tax exemptions for joint ventures in the early years of reform.
But that was years ago when domestic oil firms were just beginning to privatise and integrate with refining and marketing units and were in no shape to finance anything on their own.
Russian companies now want controlling stakes in production sharing deals and are upset that they must pay taxes on some oil produced by ventures for which their partners are exempt.
""There is a concern that the Russian producers want to go it alone,"" said the Western source, adding that whoever headed the ministry could make terms tougher for Western oil companies.
Samusev is a key link between YUKOS and Menatep in their stalled production-sharing talks with U.S.-based Amoco Corp on the $52 billion Priobsk field. The talks have faltered because the Russian side wants greater leverage and ownership in the deal.
Rodionov, appointed in August 1996, was previously director of Lentransgaz, the St Petersburg-based transport unit of Russian natural gas monopoly Gazprom  GAZP.RTS.
He left the oil sector entirely to his deputies, leaving Western oil firms -- which are ready to invest tens of billions of dollars if Moscow passes the necessary laws -- wondering whether Moscow had fundamentally changed its once more welcoming attitude towards outside participation in the energy sector.
Western firms have long said they can secure the financing to reverse lower output, which has almost halved in the last 10 years and was 6.03 million barrels per day in 1996. But that may change now that Russia has a sovereign debt rating.
""It looks like Russian oil companies and banks are beginning to land financing that they couldn't have a year-ago,"" said the European source, adding that domestic commercial banks could be seeking to exert more leverage over the sector.
"
30,"Russia's metals sectors, key suppliers to world markets, showed varying degrees of concern about President Boris Yeltsin's latest ailment on Thursday, but most said they were no longer hostage to Kremlin health scares.
Aluminium officials were the least worried and said the Russian leader's admission to hospital with pneumonia on Wednesday would not affect production or exports.
""It's business as usual,"" said Galina Stelmakova, deputy director for development and investment at AO Kontsern Alyuminiy, the producers' group.
""Yeltsin hasn't the slightest relationship to the aluminium sector. If anybody has anything to do with us, it's (Prime Minister Viktor) Chernomyrdin.""
Russia supplies 15 percent of the world aluminium market.
London Metal Exchange aluminium prices -- which in the past have swung on Kremlin health dramas -- ignored Yeltsin's pneumonia and hit a seven-month high of $1,602.
London palladium prices rose on Russia's continuing failure to sign 1997 export contracts with Japan, the world's largest consumer of platinum group metals, including palladium.
But a senior precious metals official said Yeltsin's illness would have no effect on the contracts -- despite the fact that Russia's precious metals industries are tightly controlled by the highest government officials.
Alexander Kulichkov, a deputy director in charge of platinum and palladium exports at export agency Almazjuvelirexport, said contracts to supply Japan depended upon the Duma lower house of parliament passing a delayed federal budget and on the government in general, headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
Nickel and copper producer Norilsk Nickel which received major support when Yeltsin signed a decree in 1996 promising state aid -- was keeping an eye on the health crisis.
""Indirectly of course we are concerned because Yeltsin did sign a decree promising help,"" said spokesman Sergei Vetchinin.
Norilsk is the world's second largest nickel producer and also produces platinum and platinum group metals.
Russian non-ferrous metals enterprises have not yet released official 1996 output and export figures and forecasts for 1997.
"
30,"Russia's aluminium industry, in private hands and learning market-savvy moves in ways its former state owners never could, still holds surprise cards but may no longer terrorise world markets with sudden, secret exports.
Metals analysts said on Friday that Russia, which accounts for about 15 percent of world output, would not cut production or exports in 1997 even in the face of rising costs at home, low margins and weak world prices.
Instead, smelters -- now mostly in private hands after years of turbulent shareholder battles -- would do all they could to turn profits.
""What has happened over the last year in particular is that ownership has settled down so that you can be fairly sure of the conduits of the smelters' metal,"" said a senior London metals trader who declined to be identified.
""They will continue to sell the metal, come what may.""
Russia, fresh off a two-year global output cutting agreement that expired this spring, seized the opportunity to restart some idled capacity and increase exports.
The increases laid to rest market talk that Russia wanted to craft a new output cutting deal to boost low London Metal Exchange prices. But analysts still wonder how much Russian aluminium could flood onto sensitive markets.
Asked if Russia had learned anything from the March 1994 memorandum of understanding that reduced global output 10 percent to draw down bloated stocks, the senior London source said, ""It has not learned. I don't think they care.""
Igor Prokopov, director of Kontsern Alyuminiy, the producers' group uniting Russia's aluminium industry, said 1996 primary aluminium output would rise 1.5 percent from 1995 to 2.79 million tonnes.
Production could rise another 1.5 to 2.0 percent in 1997.
The group put Russian 1996 primary aluminium exports at 2.37 million tonnes, against what it said were 2.11 million in 1995.
""Some noise has appeared in the West that Russia has cranked things up, which is not really true,"" Prokopov said.
But two base metals analysts said the figures seemed on the low side and Russian smelters had undoubtedly increased output.
But they have done so while consolidating sales operations to try to make more money on exports, which has introduced more transparency into deliveries abroad.
Shareholders, many of them Western commodities power houses, were having a greater hand in that transparency, since they were increasingly buying direct from smelters.
Pechiney of France, Glencore AG of Switzerland and London-based powerhouse Trans-World Metals and its units already have major stakes in Russian smelters.
Analysts said the Bratsk smelter, the world's largest, with annual capacity of about 850,000 tonnes, had major plans to modernise with the help of a top European industrial firm.
LME three-month aluminium futures are around $1,550 a tonne, clawing back from October's 2-1/2 year low of $1,305 but below a $2,195 in January 1995, the last major peak.
Prices had been even lower before Russia and five other countries -- the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway and the European Union -- signed the 1994 accord. The five said Russia was to blame because it had flooded markets with metal.
Those exports were largely orchestrated by the state, which needed cash to fill its coffers.
Now smelters say they are reining in trade and marketing operations to be closer to markets in a way that Soviet-style ministries in Moscow were not.
""Integration could have a positive affect,"" Prokopov said, citing expense rationalisation and consolidated balances.
Russia is an aluminium powerhouse because its Siberian smelters, which account for 90 percent of output, have endless, cheap hydroelectricity generated by rivers.
"
30,"Russia's Rosneft oil firm won a new lease of life on Monday after a Moscow court ruled it could keep its crown-jewel asset, a key Siberian oil producer coveted by a major rival.
An arbitration court said prize producer AO Purneftegaz would stay at Rosneft, ending a high-stakes tussle between Rosneft and the big SIDANKO oil company for control over the enterprise.
""The decision is key to Rosneft's survival,"" said Dan Lubash, managing director of Emerging Markets Europe at Merrill Lynch in London.
Rosneft, the state oil holding company which is slowly being privatised, lost most of its assets in recent years when President Boris Yeltsin carved up the once government-owned oil industry into vertically-integrated, privatised companies.
Monday's ruling could help keep Rosneft -- once Russia's number-one producer but now near the bottom of the list -- alive by letting it keep a company sitting on big untapped reserves.
""Purneftegaz is not just a promising producer now -- it has a lot of promising reserves,"" said Rosneft press director Vladimir Tumarkin. ""We consider today's decision an act of legal justice in Russia and a victory for Rosneft.""
Attractive Purneftegaz, a Western Siberian enterprise that pumped over eight million tonnes of crude in 1995, has long been the object of a corporate wrangle between Rosneft and SIDANKO.
Under Yeltsin's sweeping oil industry restructuring, a 1994 government resolution awarded Purneftegaz to SIDANKO (the Siberian-Far Eastern Oil Company) -- but a 1995 executive order shifted ownership back to Rosneft.
Vladimir Vetluzhky, an arbitration court member, told Reuters that the body had ruled against SIDANKO's lawsuit to have the 1995 decision reversed.
Purneftegaz's output accounted for about two-thirds of Rosneft's production of 13 million tonnes last year.
""Purneftegaz is much more important to Rosneft than it is to SIDANKO,"" said Stephen O'Sullivan, associate director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London.
Spokesmen at SIDANKO, one of Russia's top five oil majors in terms of output, were not available for comment.
SIDANKO, which energy analysts said wields little control over its key subsidiary, producer Chernogorneft, badly wanted Purneftegaz and its exports to pay off debts and taxes.
""Purneftegaz is one of Russia's most promising oil firms,"" said petroleum economist Rustem Shagiyev of the government's Academy of Economics. ""The ruling is very positive for Rosneft.""
But other analysts said Rosneft may need more to prosper in Russia's newly-competitive oil industry.
""The decision means Rosneft is still in business as a vertically-integrated oil company -- but it will need more than just one big producer to compete,"" said oil analyst Steve Allen of CentreInvest consultancy in Moscow.
Rosneft's other major asset is Sakhalinmorneftegaz, partner to four giant foreign energy projects in Russia's Far East.
O'Sullivan said the tug-of-war for Purneftegaz may yet continue and that SIDANKO could appeal against Monday's court ruling -- but Tumarkin said the corporate tussle had come to an end.
Purneftegaz shares barely reacted to the decision, nudging down to $2.28 on the Russian Trading System at 1445 GMT from Friday's close of $2.30.
""If the decision had been different, it would have been a major blow to Rosneft,"" Lubash said.
"
30,"Russia said on Wednesday it would restructure natural gas monopoly Gazprom's operations, but Western analysts and even a junior company official said the move would leave the world's largest gas company intact.
""What Gazprom has suggested for itself is not a restructuring but a commercialisation of their services in Russia,"" said Jonathan Stern, vice-president of Gas Strategies in London and an expert on Russian gas.
Asked if Russia would reshape one of its most powerful companies in the formal sense of the word, Stern said: ""No. But it is corporatisation in the Western sense.""
Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin told a news conference the goverment would restructure Gazprom's home operations and possibly split its domestic output and transport arms.
He said the changes at Gazprom -- whose American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) keep investors drooling -- would in no way affect foreign shareholders.
""Domestic restructuring, yes. But we will not weaken Gazprom as an international corporation,"" he said.
Carving up Gazprom, whose gas accounts for 60 percent of Europe's gas imports, could deregulate the firm along the lines of British Gas Plc if carried out Western style.
""There's more smoke than fire here,"" said Stephen O'Sullivan, associate oil and gas director at MC Securities in London. ""I don't think there's any serious restructuring here.
""Third-party access is not enshrined in Russia,"" he said, referring to the fact that Gazprom controls 94 percent of Russia's gas production and most of its transmission but has hesitated to allow other companies sell its output.
Lira Rozenova, an economic adviser to Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev, said any changes would keep the company whole.
""An Economy Ministry programme to 2000 assumes that restructuring and state regulation in the gas industry will be carried out while preserving in the medium-term the organisational and production unity of RAO Gazprom,"" she said.
Gazprom accounts for a quarter of world gas output and its 1996 production rose one percent to 575 billion cubic metres (20.31 trillion cu ft). It raised $429 million last year with ADRs and plans a Eurobond issue this year.
""ADR investors should be more worried about other things,"" O'Sullivan said, citing questions over whether Gazprom will ever liberalise trade in its very illiquid shares in Russia.
Stern said Yasin's remarks were essentially about accounting changes rather than structural ones.
""Transport units would pay the producers' units costs,"" he said, adding that the plan aimed to improve Gazprom finances. ""The Russians don't mean what we mean by restructuring.""
A senior British energy consultant said Yasin's remarks were ""kite-flying by the government"".
Gazprom was once an entire ministry run by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Analysts said the firm would owe $7-$8 billion in annual taxes to the government if it could collect 50 trillion roubles in domestic debts.
Gazprom still has friends in high places and plans to sell even more gas to Europe from vast untapped Arctic reserves. But it has come under pressure to contribute more to the federal budget.
But Moscow may lack the will to alter one of Russia's most profitable and powerful firms substantially.
""Periodically, some radical economists in Russia have suggested truly restructuring Gazprom,"" Stern said. ""But they have always failed. The political risk of destroying the Gazprom structure is too great.""

8,"Regulations issued by Indonesia earlier this year promoting the creation of mutual funds have become a landmark for the local industry, delegates to a conference said on Wednesday.
""The recognition of open-end funds or mutual funds by the Capital Market Law has been quite instrumental in the development of the Indonesian investment fund industry over the past few months,"" said Melli Darsa of the law firm Hadiputranto, Hadinoto and Partners in Jakarta.
Darsa was one of several fund experts attending a mutual fund conference in Jakarta who predicted a bright future for the domestic industry, with seven open-end mutual funds already established and five more in the pipeline.
Indonesia released regulations in May outlining accounting methods, reporting procedures and valuation methods for open-end mutual funds, which were allowed for the first time by the country's 1995 Capital Market Law.
The new legal framework gives Indonesia an edge, placing it half-way between the high risk and reward markets in China and India and the most exciting developed countries, most of which have hostile tax regimes, said Anthony Travers of the Hong Kong law firm Maples and Calder.
""In many respects, Indonesia is a halfway house,"" Travers told the conference. ""Indonesia has a much more developed (financial) infrastructure than China and India.""
But delegates saw significant obstacles ahead, including an almost complete ignorance of mutual funds among Indonesians, high-yielding bank deposits that lure domestic savings away from Jakarta's illiquid stock market, and restrictions on foreign investment.
Although Indonesian pension funds hold nearly US$2.4 billion they are prohibited from investing overseas, prompting some foreign fund managers to question the benefits of establishing Indonesian subsidiaries that will be restricted to managing domestic funds onshore.
But government officials made it clear that the purpose of the new rules was to persuade Indonesians to invest at home to spur development of domestic capital markets.
""We want to enhance domestic self-sufficiency. That is why you can only invest in Indonesian securities or new offerings,"" said Iwan Pontjowinoto, president director of P.T. Danareksa Fund Management, a state-controlled finance company that launched the first of the new open funds.
""We want to have local funds that can help the government by investing in the stock market,"" he said.
The new funds can only invest in domestic securities and are prohibited from selling more than one percent of their shares or units to any one investor, ensuring a wide investor base.
The new rules also ensure the funds are broadly invested, prohibiting them from spending more than 10 percent of their net asset value on any one company or buying securities representing more than five percent of the issuer's paid-up capital.
The conference, which attracted about 40 delegates from fund management companies, law firms, rating agencies and fund custodians around Asia, ended on Wednesday with a workshop on how to structure and price mutual funds.

8,"The longer-term interests of a US$1 billion stake in Russian equity markets dictated last week's decision to unwind a controversial fund that planned to invest in Russian gas monopoly Gazprom, Regent Pacific Group Ltd said on Monday.
""We've had to sacrifice the smaller interest in Gazprom to the much bigger interest we've got in Russia overall,"" Jim Mellon, Regent Pacific's managing director, told Reuters.
Hong Kong-based Regent Pacific decided to back away last week from a dispute with Gazprom over a US$200 million fund designed to invest in the domestic shares of the gas giant.
""We don't want to get into a lengthy legal battle and jeopardise our (other) Russian funds,"" Mellon said.
""Gazprom is the biggest company (in Russia) and we certainly don't want to go up against them,"" Mellon said.
Gazprom restricts foreign investment to nine percent of share capital, which it issues in the form of American Depositary Shares.
These ADRs trade at four times the value of the domestic shares, which Regent's fund hoped to purchase because it was incorporated in Russia -- even though all the fundholders were foreign institutions.
Mellon defended the scheme on Monday as ""completely legal"" but said Regent backed away from a dispute with Gazprom after it asked Regent not to buy the domestic shares.
""There was never any question of foreigners getting their direct hands on the shares,"" said Mellon.
""If you consult any lawyer they'll tell you our scheme is absolutely watertight, completely legal, but from a practical point of view it's all very well for Regent to go up against Hambros Bank but it would be very foolish of us to go up against Gazprom,"" he added.
Regent owns between three and four percent of Hambros and has been arguing forcefully that the bank is better broken up.
Mellon said that while Hambros might enjoy prestige as one of Britain's last remaining independent merchant banks, it cannot compare with Gazprom which numbers Russia's current prime minister and energy minister among its former executives.
Regent's Gazprom fund hoped to attract fundholders keen to arbitrage the ADRs and the domestic share prices.
""I suppose the worry that Gazprom had was that people might sell the ADRs or alternatively not buy the next issue of ADRs and buy our fund instead, which was the same issue but at a much lower price,"" said Mellon.
""Or alternatively, if you were a hedge fund, you might go short the ADRs and long our fund and seek to exploit the gap.""
So far, only 1.5 percent of the foreign allotment of nine percent of share capital have been issued, Mellon said.
However, Mellon argued that the fund was Gazprom's idea in the first place and based on an arbitrage long-practiced by Russian brokers.
Timing was probably the root cause of the difficulty.
""Only once we got the money did they come out against it,"" Mellon said. ""One suspects its definitely in their interest longer-term to have the local share price higher versus the offshore price. In the immediate term it's not in their interest because they wanted to raise more ADRs.""
Gazprom's domestic shares were trading at about US$0.645 on Monday against US$0.53 last week. The London-traded ADRs, equivalent to 10 underlying shares, at US$17.35 against more than US$20.00 last week.

8,"A festive calm settled over Hong Kong on Thursday as people prepared to welcome the Year of the Ox, the territory's last Lunar New Year celebration under British rule.
With the clock ticking towards transition to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30, Hong Kong people took time out from hectic schedules for the Chinese equivalent of a Western Christmas or American Thanksgiving.
Last-minute shoppers dashed through malls, record numbers of travellers flowed across the border to visit relatives in China and children threw empty red ""lai see"" money pockets at each other on Hong Kong harbour's Star Ferry.
""Kung Hei Fat Choi, may you be rich and make more money,"" said Ng Chak Kwong. ""Everybody wants this to be a good year. Too many people worry about everything.""
But the cheerful greeting cards, office towers ablaze with lights, strings of red firecrackers and little orange trees offered few clues to Hong Kong's real state of mind on New Year's eve. This year's festivities were set against a backdrop of rising political tension after China's recent pledge to roll back some civil liberties laws following the handover, plans that sparked an outcry both at home and abroad.
The Democratic Party, the territory's largest party, collected 20,000 signatures opposing the plans while the international community lodged official protests with China.
Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa, the man who will take over from colonial Governor Chris Patten after the handover, last week defended the proposed legal changes as misunderstood, but few were convinced.
Some of the families gathering for traditional New Year banquets on Thursday night said they would watch a televised annual address by Patten, even though the British influence is already considered virtually irrelevant.
The last New Year's address by a British colonial governor could provide Patten with an ideal opportunity to lambast old foes in Beijing.
""What he says has no effect any more,"" said shopper Alice So. ""What he says, what he did, what he's going to do, the Chinese government will not accept. It doesn't matter whether he's right or wrong.""
Most Hong Kong people seemed determined to ignore politics during the holiday. Four days of parades and fairs were planned, and spectacular fireworks would light up the sky on Saturday.
According to Chinese astrologers, the coming year offered Hong Kong plenty of promise but obstacles as well.
Unlike Western astrology, where months of the year are grouped into separate star signs, Chinese astrology hinges on the year of birth.
That could mean bad news for Tung, who was born in 1937, the Year of the Ox.
According to the astrologer at the South China Morning Post newspaper, Tung faced a difficult year marked by envy and accident and is advised to seek compromise.
""He is likely to be caught between Hong Kong people and the Chinese government and may be the object of envy by mainland officials,"" warned astrologer Sung Siu-kwong.
Patten, born under the sign of the Monkey in 1944, was warned about the emergence of a rival in mid-year and cautioned to draw a line between private and public involvements.
""He will need to overcome obstacles that can stand in the way of the glorious withdrawal,"" Sung said.

8,"Foreign investors seeking access to China could consider the road industry, which needs more than US$6 billion in foreign money to complete four national highways by 2000, SBC Warburg said.
Low rates of investment are considered largely responsible for clogged highways in China, where 1,500 counties and 190,000 villages had no road access at the end of 1994.
Road building has not kept pace with the growth in civilian vehicles, which has risen a compound 13.4 percent each year between 1978 and 1995 -- roughly in line with the country's rapid economic expansion.
By comparison, the total length of highways over the same period has increased only by an average 1.6 percent a year.
""The main reason behind this slow development in China's highway network is the insufficient investment in the sector,"" SBC Warburg said recently.
Investment is a pressing problem with China's ambitious plan to build a network of 12 national trunk routes totalling 30,000 km by the 2010, with the first four highways to be completed by 2000.
Total construction cost is estimated at 540 billion yuan ($65 billion) over 10 years, most of which will come from domestic funding, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
""However, it is estimated that as much as $6 billion will have to come from foreign investors,"" SBC Warburg said.
Foreign investors first started entering China's road industry during the Eighth Five Year Plan, and the resulting investment helped to accelerate the expansion of highways 12.6 percent to 1.15 million km between 1991 and 1995.
Among the better-known foreign-invested higways are Hopewell Holding's Guangzhou-Shenzhen Superhighway; New World Infrastructure's Guangzhou Northern Ring Road, which opened in 1994; Road King Infrastructure, which signed its first toll road joint venture in December 1993; Cheung Kong Infrastructure and CITIC Pacific.
Guangdong Investment and Guangzhou Investment are also active players.
Most projects are toll roads, which SBC Warburg warned can be difficult to set up and operate in China. Central and provincial approvals are required and collection can be fraught with ""natural"" hazards such as traffic accidents and robberies.
""It does not seem to us, however, that such irregularities are damaging the investment merits of Chinese toll roads, if the investor can work closely with the local authorities on containing the leakage at some pre-determined levels,"" the broker said.
There are clear signs that China is actively encouraging foreign investment in this sector.
Expressways, tunnels and bridges are open to 100 percent foreign ownership and there is no limit in foreign participation in Chinese joint ventures on first and second-class highways.
Experiments with various types of funding sources and investment structures are being encouraged.
And, as part of the central government's efforts to promote a more standardised build-operate-transfer structure for infrastructure projects, it is preparing to offer a bridge in Wuhan for international tender.
""We expect the market to be increasingly open to foreign participation, as additional funding sources help attract more investors and reduce financing costs,"" SBC Warburg concluded.

8,"Pegged currencies are common in Asia, with its fondness for order and authoritarianism.
But to peg one's currency is always a drastic step with heavy consequences. While a fixed exchange rate might reassure foreign investors about currency stability, it can also prompt a slew of unruly side effects.
""What you ultimately sacrifice is your control over inflation,"" said Alan Butler-Henderson, regional strategist with ING Barings in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore and China all peg their currencies directly or indirectly to the U.S. dollar, requiring all them to mimic U.S. monetary policy to a greater or lesser extent regardless of domestic conditions.
Most of these economies bear no relation at all to the slow-growth, low-inflation United States. Instead, they are experiencing high growth and a rapid increase in domestic consumption at the same time -- an ideal recipe for inflation.
The lack of traditional inflation-fighting tools is a serious loss for countries anxious to avoid any erosion of often hard-earned economic progress.
SERIOUS PENALTIES
There are other, serious penalties, too.
A lucrative interest rate arbitrage can cause real problems for small Asian countries with fixed exchange rates. Best described as borrow low, lend high, the most common arbitrage tends to attract precisely the sort of capital inflows most small, Asian countries dread: so-called ""hot money.""
Large financial institutions with access to the best international lending rates deposit borrowed funds into Asian banks offering much higher yields and, because of the fixed exchange rate, avoid currency loss when they switch out.
Higher rates offer bigger returns, which attract even larger flows of hot money that swell money supply dramatically. Attempts by central banks to curb money supply by raising rates can have the reverse effect, luring in more hot, volatile money.
Both Thailand and Indonesia are familiar with this danger.
One economist noted that Indonesia has offered one of the best arbitrage opportunities in Asia for as long as it has depreciated its currency by between three and five percent annually, but the returns were particularly spectacular last year.
Speculators and hedge funds borrowed large sums in Japanese yen at about 0.75 percent annually and switched them into Indonesian bank accounts yielding 15 percent -- or more when riots swept through Jakarta in the summer.
""In terms of cost of funds, when you take the currency depreciation of the yen and the mild depreciation of the rupiah into account, you're paying nothing,"" the economist said.
The problem became so acute last year that Indonesia's central bank was forced to widen repeatedly the trading band for the rupiah, taking the market by surprise.
""The point of widening the fluctuation is to impart greater uncertainty so that it's not a freebie,"" said Sun Bae Kim, senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.
Indonesia also ordered its commercial banks to stop lending on occasion, even though soaring rates and strong loan demand offered excellent returns.
THE THAI EXPERIENCE
Thailand, which pegs its beleaguered baht to a basket of currencies including the U.S. dollar, tried to turn this arbitrage to its advantage by setting up the Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF) in 1993.
The plan, much admired by Asian experts, back-fired when Moody's Investors Service downgraded Thailand's short-term debt rating, drawing attention to its foreign liabilities.
The negative attention helped to fuel rampant speculation about a devaluation of the baht, forcing massive intervention by Thailand's central bank to keep the unit above a 6-1/2-year low.
Under the BIBF, a number of foreign and domestic banks were allowed to borrow foreign currency overseas, usually in U.S. dollars, and then lend the money in Thailand.
The scheme was a huge success. Foreign investors, already benefiting from competitive rates, also qualified for preferential tax treatment and rushed to invest in Thailand.
""Without those tax incentives and the access to cheap loans - U.S. dollars are by definition cheaper than Thailand (baht) - those companies would not be attracted to Thailand,"" said Clive McDonnell, chief economist at Crosby Group.
BIBF flows were used primarily for long-term investment, but international accounting rules required that they be classifed as short-term. This generated a sudden explosion in Thailand's short-term external debt to 63.3 percent of private sector debt in 1995 compared with 20.5 percent in 1993 -- a situation that quickly came to Moody's attention.
Asian economists defended the scheme while acknowledging its risks. Salomon Brothers noted that Thailand's foreign exchange reserves of US$38 billion far exceed outstanding short-term loans of US$16.1 billion.
And Moody's rival, Standard and Poor's, pointed out that many BIBF loans are backed by foreign banks rather than domestic financial institutions.
""Foreign BIBFs are probably less vulnerable to shifts in investor confidence, because their parent banks are more likely to stand behind them should unaffiliated lenders withdraw their credit lines,"" Standard &amp; Poor's said. ""Moreover, obligations of foreign-owned BIBFs are not a contingent liability of the Thai government, given their foreign ownership.""
There is no question that the BIBF helped to lift foreign liabilities in Thailand's banking sector, but the underlying causes of the banks' asset quality problems were more commonly blamed on a weak property sector, economic recession, political turmoil and a gaping current account deficit.
Recent attacks on the baht were precipitated by concern about how to finance the current account following projections of a fourth-quarter fiscal deficit.
But analysts said the foreign liability created by the BIBF will probably provide further motivation for the central bank to defend the currency. And a sustained defence will require action on those asset quality problems.
""This means shutting down insolvent institutions and building the capital base of viable ones. The longer the delay in formulating such a plan, the greater will be the baht's susceptibility to speculative attacks,"" Goldman Sachs said.
"
8,"Now that China's Deng Xiaoping is dead, Hong Kong faces a future without the figurehead who helped to assure the territory's confidence and stability, among the two most important words in the investor's lexicon.
As the architect of the ""One country, two systems"" policy, Deng provided the framework that will guide Hong Kong's return to China on July 1 this year.
His open-door policy also transformed the territory's economy from an industrial and manufacturing hub into a service centre geared to China's emergence.
Deng's passing last week was an important milestone for the city-state he helped to shape.
The immediate impact of his death would be small, as the paramount leader's nuts-and-bolts involvement in Hong Kong affairs was limited.
But the longer term effect would be significant, particularly as Hong Kong prepared for its July 1 transition into a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, after more than 150 years of British colonial rule.
""To all intents and purposes, he was inactive but while he was there, his standing allowed large numbers of people to move and shake on the basis of his authority,"" said David Dodwell, author and director at Jardine Fleming Holdings.
""That is the biggest imponderable: to what extent could the people promoting economic reform become vulnerable.""
ECONOMIC REFORM TO CONTINUE REGARDLESS
Few doubt that the economic reforms Deng initiated and upon which Hong Kong depends so heavily will proceed.
Too much change has already become entrenched, and China's growing number of jobless will require continued progress as the private sector, most of it built and supported by foreign investment, is the nation's only job creator, Dodwell said.
That is a positive factor for Hong Kong, which has been the primary investment gateway into China. In 1995, Hong Kong accounted for $80 billion of direct investment in China, or 60 percent of a total realised foreign direct investment of $133 billion.
Rising foreign investment also would imply increased demand for services, which would at least guarantee steady economic growth, albeit at slower rates than 20 years ago.
""We won't see double digit growth rates again,"" said George Leung, economist at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
""I would also not see growth slowing sharply, to say one or two percent, because Hong Kong still has the backing of China. If China grows from nine to 10 percent each year you can imagine the demand for services in Hong Kong.""
THE POLITICAL PACE OF CHANGE
The pace of reform -- and of economic growth -- has always been a hot political issue in China, as has management of the industrial sector which is dominated by huge, labour intensive and debt-laden state enterprises.
""There seems to have been a certain policy inertia. What will the next step be?"" asked Michael Martin, economist at the government-funded Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
All eyes will be on China's 15th National People's Congress in October for signs of renewed momentum in policy-making and the collective leadership's commitment to change.
""As that new domestic economic policy and particularly industrial policy emerges it will have implications for what Hong Kong's role will be for the next decade or so,"" Martin said.
Hong Kong can rest assured that the role Deng carved out for it 15 years ago will remain intact for the time being, Martin said. China's absence of basic financial infrastructure, a reliable legal system or even property rights seems to assure Hong Kong's near-term future as the nation's investment gateway.
But as China develops, the territory's role could diminish.
""Its role over time is likely to become more modest,"" said Dodwell. ""Over time, the mainland Chinese economy and companies in the mainland in centres such as Shanghai will become more successful and the economic centres of gravity will shift.""
HONG KONG KEEPS WARY WATCH ON SHANGHAI
Shanghai is viewed with suspicion by many in Hong Kong, who fear its rapid economic progress and close ties to the current collective leadership in Beijing.
""Shanghai has for many years now been given priority by the Chinese leadership as they tried to rebuild strength there but I don't honestly see that those commitments to help Shanghai to grow, will be in any way at the expense of Hong Kong,"" said Dodwell.
Hong Kong's best scenario for the future will depend on a China that succeeds, but not too well, Dodwell said. ""If China really motors and gets really clever, it doesn't need Hong Kong any more.""
But Martin said China is going to need more than one financial centre, one port or one major transportation hub.
""Rather than a situation where they are competing head to head, it will be more a situation of how the two can complement each other for the overall growth of China,"" he said.
HONG KONG MUST KEEP LOOKING OUT, NOT IN....
Martin stressed Hong Kong's international role, partly because the world's trade structure is shifting more quickly than in the past. Production facilities are more mobile, flexible and integrated and Hong Kong's international exposure and expertise will remain crucial to China's success, he said.
""The future of southern China depends on its ability to respond to those shifts and reorient activities into new product areas, or move up the technological ladder,"" he said.
But there are other, more subtle concerns, including a common fear that China will plunder Hong Kong's coffers.
China has pledged its support for Hong Kong's monetary independence, but economic tzar Zhu Rongji in the past has made frequent pleas to the wealthy coastal provinces in favour of China's poorer central areas.
The price of plundering Hong Kong would be high, Dodwell warned. International investors have committed $330 billion so far in China, two-thirds of which came through Hong Kong. Actual investment from Hong Kong is over $100 billion, much of it from overseas Chinese.
""In theory, it's always posible but it would be a one-off gift. Is China really going to cut off its nose to spite its face?"" Dodwell asked. ""If it came in and scooped up the pot, what demonstration does that give to the overseas economy, and particularly the overseas Chinese economy?""

8,"Temperatures are rising as Hong Kong prepares for its midsummer transition to Chinese rule, and nowhere is it hotter than at the territory's newspapers.
Those on the front lines of freedom of speech -- one of the hottest issues of the transition -- are fighting back against accusations of pro-China bias and self-censorship, charges that are difficult to prove and even more difficult to dispute.
Chief among the accused is the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's leading English-language daily.
Ever since 1995, when it canned the popular cartoon ""The World of Lily Wong"", which had taken regular swipes at China, the English-language Post has been snubbed and dubbed the ""Pro China Morning Post"" by its foes.
More recently, it came under attack for hiring a founding editor of China's state-owned China Daily as a consultant.
Much of the concern was rooted in the location of the consultant's office close to editor Jonathan Fenby, who firmly denies being under Beijing's thumb.
""I am the editor,"" Fenby told Reuters. ""He will not be involved in editorial decisions.""
SPOTLIGHT TURNS TO CANTONESE DAILY
Similar charges have been made against Ming Pao, one of Hong Kong's best-selling Chinese-language newspapers.
A recent front-page story in the Asian Wall Street Journal outlined a shift in editorial focus at the independent daily.
Ming Pao's reputation for diligent reporting of Chinese politics and dissident activity had faded, the Journal said.
For example, when Tung Chee-hwa was picked in December to lead Hong Kong after it returns to Chinese control on July 1 after 156 years as a British colony, one Ming Pao headline read, ""Tung impresses one most by his character"".
But concrete examples of bias are hard to come by -- and that's not surprising, according to journalism professor Tim Hamlett at Hong Kong Baptist University.
""People don't march down the corridors and say, 'Our focus is changing',"" he said. ""People just pick up what's wanted from hundreds of tiny details. Is your story the front-page lead, the inside-page lead or is it buried at the back?""
Perhaps more telling, one in five journalists admitted hesitating to criticize China, according to a survey conducted by Chinese University of Hong Kong in early May.
More than half said they thought most working journalists in Hong Kong were hesitant to criticize their future sovereign, while one-third felt that most journalists also tempered their criticism of large corporations in Hong Kong.
The findings supported a 1995 survey by the Hong Kong Journalists' Association, in which 90 percent said self-censorship was occurring in Hong Kong.
In the HKJA survey, 80 percent expected things would change after the handover while the more recent Chinese University survey revealed a ""wait and see"" attitude among most Hong Kong journalists, with more than half worried that press freedom would change past the handover.
""Although Hong Kong journalists highly support the values of press freedom, they seem to develop considerable uncertainty about Hong Kong's future,"" the survey's authors wrote.
UNCERTAINTY, CAUTION ORDER OF THE DAY
Senior Chinese leaders have warned the Hong Kong press against advocating independence for the territory or for Taiwan and there are ample precedents for journalists who may wonder what will happen to them if they ignore these warnings.
In 1994, China sentenced Ming Pao journalist Xi Yang to 12 years in prison for espionage for using central bank information on interest rates and gold sales -- the sort of scoop that would have won Xi professional kudos in the West.
Xi was released earlier this year as a goodwill gesture -- but at about the same time, Chinese authorities arrested an SBC Warburg analyst and questioned her for a month after she, too, obtained and used central bank information.
Then there is Jimmy Lai, the controversial entrepreneur who in a 1994 column called Chinese Premier Li Peng ""a turtle's egg"", a terrible insult in Chinese.
Lai's Giordano clothing shop in China was forced to close shortly after his column ran. Lai has since sold his Giordano stake, but the company still has difficulty on the mainland.
More recently, Lai has found it hard finding an underwriter for one of his companies, Next Media Group, which he wants to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Freedom of speech is considered crucial to the continued commercial success of Hong Kong, whose large and developed financial markets require free flowing, high-quality information to function efficiently.
But democracy is a relatively new concept in Hong Kong.
Fenby argued that, rather than a shift in favour of China, the South China Morning Post has shed its former identity as a colonial mouthpiece and become an independent daily reflecting Hong Kong's new realities.
Fenby even said colonial officials had made a forceful request to remove a story that embarrassed Patten from the front page -- a charge government spokesman Kerry McGlynn denied.
""I'm not shocked by that...(but) Tung's office hasn't called. Neither has Xinhua,"" Fenby said. ""(Freedom of the press) is what we do here, and that is what we are going to continue doing through July 1.""
"
8,"U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Thursday he expected to discuss with China allegations of illegal funding to the Democratic Party by Beijing during his visit, even though he considered it a domestic issue.
""Obviously I think this will come up in Beijing...(but) this is not a Chinese problem,"" Gingrich, on a 10-day Asian tour, told the American Chamber of Commerce before leaving for Beijing on Thursday evening.
The Washington Post has reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of the U.S. Congress last year they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign funds from foreign corporations.
U.S. Vice President Al Gore said he talked about the issue on Tuesday in Beijing with Chinese Premier Li Peng, who has denied the reports. Gore said that the probe into the allegations should not disrupt China-U.S. ties, but proof of payments would make it a serious matter.
Gingrich, who was in Hong Kong on a two-day visit and was due to arrive in Beijing hours after Gore leaves, said the campaign financing scandal should be treated as a domestic issue, albeit a serious one.
""This is an American problem,"" Gingrich said. ""It is an American law violated by Americans engaging in acts which are illegal in our system, and we have an obligation to police our system.""
He said the United States would defend its political system from foreign interference, and called upon Asian nations for cooperation on investigations.
""My only point in Beijing and in Taiwan would be, if we need information about specific people and specific companies, we hope you will give us the information,"" he said.
The China allegations followed other reports of irregular fund-raising by the Democratic Party involving Asian nations and American-Asians based in the United States.
Gingrich said the media's portrayal of the fund-raising affair as a complicated international issue was incorrect.
""It's not complicated at all,"" he said. ""About a year and a half ago, a group of people sat down and decided they couldn't win the election if they didn't raise every penny they could from every source they could, and if they actually obeyed the law, it'd be too complicated.""
U.S. President Bill Clinton this month blamed much of the controversy on a political system that was ""out of whack"".
"
8,"China's resounding declaration of support for the Hong Kong dollar makes a successful assault on the currency even more unlikely, foreign exchange experts said on Wednesday.
""The only way you're going to get a remote chance of a successful speculative attack is if there is such a crisis of confidence it begins to affect retail bank deposits. Otherwise, I just don't see it,"" said Jim Rohwer, Asian emerging markets strategist for C.S. First Boston in Hong Kong.
Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, reiterated at a Bank of England seminar in London on Tuesday that Beijing stands ready to defend the Hong Kong dollar from attack if need be.
""We are prepared to offer liquidity support to the (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) for the purpose of stabilising the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar,"" Chen said. ""We also stand ready to use our foreign reserves to support the Hong Kong dollar, if necessary.""
The Hong Kong dollar peg was set in 1983 at HK$7.80 to the US dollar when jitters connected to the 1997 handover sent it into a tailspin. The peg still remains Hong Kong's first line of defence against economic instability associated with the handover at midnight on June 30 next year.
The peg has an impressive track record. It withstood the fallout from the Tiananmen massacre in June 1989, when the Hong Kong stock market plunged, and also the global stock market crash of 1987.
""Nineteen ninety-seven is just a date on the calendar at this point,"" said one currency trader. ""There is no uncertainty. You're either here or you're not here. It won't be Independence Day. There are no aliens.""
An opportunistic attack upon the currency in January 1995 was quickly warded off by Hong Kong's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which immediately raised interest rates to punishing levels.
Experts said a speculative assault upon the currency would almost certainly be doomed given Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves of around US$60 billion.
As well as access to China's reserves of $90 billion, Hong Kong has repurchase agreements with several Asian nations that hoard U.S. dollars, partly to protect relatively fragile and export-dependent economies.
Such a deep war chest is a formidable deterrent to all but the richest and most determined of speculators.
""The only thing that can break the peg at this point is political instability that causes capital outflows,"" another trader said.
But the extent of the political unrest would have to be extraordinary, given the Hong Kong dollar's immunity to the political instability in Beijing in June 1989.
""It would have to be a real debacle. You have to imagine something much, much worse than Tiananmen,"" said Bill Overholt, director of research at Bankers Trust in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong does not have sufficient reserves to defend a sustained run on the territory's banking deposits, but there are few signs so far that retail investors are concerned.
Rohwer said that confidence appears to be improving with the Hong Kong dollar moving at the stronger end of its trading band. Also, the proportion of banking deposits held in foreign currency is falling, reaching 45 percent at the end of the April this year compared to 54 percent in 1991.
"
8,"Economic commentators in Hong Kong are sounding alarms about the unbridled optimism spurring stock and property prices to new highs ahead of the British colony's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.
Concerns are mounting that rising price pressures could inflate a collapsible bubble on the assumption that China will support Hong Kong's economy through the transition regardless of any political disruption.
""The term 'moral hazard' refers to the apparently growing belief in local markets that there is little dramatic down-side risk -- as opposed to short-term volatility -- because ultimately China will suppport Hong Kong markets,"" Ian Perkin, chief economist with the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.
In contrast to earlier fears that political uncertainty could torpedo Hong Kong's economy in 1997, domestic confidence in China's determination to keep the economy stable through the transition is so high that an unexpected problem has arisen -- price instability.
INFLATION FORECASTS ON THE RISE
Economists are starting to revise upwards their inflation forecasts for 1997 in response to booming stock and luxury property prices.
""The outlook for 1997 is going to be less good than we thought,"" said Kevin Chan, economist at Salomon Brothers.
Salomon has raised its 1997 forecast for the territory's benchmark consumer price index to seven percent from 6.6 percent late last year, and Chan said further increases are possible.
Sudden strength in Hong Kong's stock market in the middle of last year was welcomed as proof of confidence in the colony's future under China, and evidence of an economic turnaround following an export slump early last year and three years of austerity in China.
But the optimism became concern in November when speculation emerged in the luxury end of Hong Kong's property market.
Citing anecdotal evidence, Perkin argued that overseas and domestic investors confident of China's commitment to economic stability in Hong Kong are rushing to buy high-end properties in anticipation of short-term gains.
The Hong Kong government has since strongly supported a set of anti-speculation measures by the Real Estate Developers Association, and warned it will step in if there are signs that speculation is filtering down to the middle or low end of the property market.
But economists said property price volatility would eventually stimulate overall inflation, even though it has been restricted so far to the high end of the market.
""This will not be good for inflation expectations,"" Chan said. ""In general, people will expect the higher prices in the luxury sector to affect medium and small flats.""
RENTS TO RISE 15 PERCENT THIS YEAR
Chan estimates an overall rise of 30 percent in property prices will translate into at least a 15 percent increase in rents this year, which account for 25 percent of the Hong Kong government's benchmark consumer price index (A).
Food prices, which account for 37 percent of CPI(A), are expected to rise by at least eight percent this year after holding steady last year.
Hong Kong will also suffer from its currency link to the U.S. dollar. If the United States raises short-term interest rates this year by 25 to 50 basis points, as many expect, real rates in Hong Kong -- the difference between nominal rates and inflation -- will fall to about one percent, Chan said.
Such low rates will propel growing momentum in both private consumption and retail sales.
China, with its well-documented aversion to the socially destabilising effects of inflation, has done little to stoke further exuberance over Hong Kong's post-1997 economy beyond saying it backed Hong Kong's currency link.
""There seems little doubt Hong Kong's new sovereign wants to see the local economy prosper throughout the year of transition and in the early years of its resumption of sovereignty,"" Perkin wrote. ""It (is) probably true that it does not want to see the local economy going on a speculative spree that will eventually run out of steam and cause a collapse.""

36,"The French government said on Tuesday it was to complete the privatisation of computer-maker Cie des Machines Bull by selling another stake of at least five percent.
The sale, after a capital increase of ""several hundreds of millions of francs"" will reduce the government's share in the company, both directly and through the national telecoms company France Telecom to below 50 percent.
The Paris Bourse said it had suspended Bull's shares, which last traded at 33 French francs ($6.36), at the company's request until after completion of the operation which will take several weeks.
Japan's NEC, Motorola of the U.S. and France Telecom have a 17 percent Bull stake each and are expected to subscribe to the capital increase.
The state, with a 36 percent stake, will first subscribe to the capital increase and then sell the shares to private investors.
IBM, which has 1.6 percent, is expected not to join in the capital increase. It had also passed at two previous occasions. Japan's Dai Nippon Printing, 3.3 percent, has been invited to join in the capital increase.
The Finance Ministry said in a statement it will decided on the issue price and the identity of the buyers after advice by the independent Privatisation Commission.
Interested parties have 15-days to express their interest in blocks of at least 1.4 million shares, or one percent of Bull.
Thierry Breton, managing director, told Reuters the operation would give Bull the freedom to decide on any mergers or acquisitions while it played its role in the restructuring of the European computer industry.
""With the support of our private shareholders, we can do that either by a market operation, by a merger or acquisition or by both,"" he said.
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the former McKinsey consultant made chairman in 1993, said earlier this year that the company wanted the state to sell a 20 percent stake to a fourth industrial partner, preferably European, and financial investors.
""Rather than to wait for when the opportunity presented itself before doing anything, the shareholders have decided to put us in a position so that we could act as a private company when the time is ripe,"" Breton said when asked whether today's announcement meant the industrial plans had changed.
Breton said the other companies invloved in the restructuring of the European computer industry were Italy's Olivetti, Philips Electronics of the Netherlands and Siemens AG of Germany. ""There are also the European units of U.S. companies that may be interested in participating in the restructuring,"" he said.
Bull came back to the black in 1995 after combined losses of 22 billion francs since 1990. Breton said the company kept its profit forecast of higher 1996 profits, after 306 million in 1995, but he declined to confirm the group aimed at more than 600 million.
""We keep our forecast, we are on line to deliver on our promise,"" Breton said.
Bull in February effectively withdrew from the troubled personal computer market by merging its Zenith Data division with Packard Bell Electronics Inc of the U.S. ($1=5.190 French Franc)

36,"Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and French chemical group Rhone-Poulenc SA Thursday announced the merger of their animal health businesses to create a new company that will be the world leader in the sector.
Merial Animal Health, their 50/50 joint venture with estimated 1996 sales of $1.750 billion, will be the market leader in biology products, veterinary drugs and poultry drugs, they said.
Merial will overtake Pfizer-Smithkline Beecham, Bayer and Novartis -- the recent merger between Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG of Switzerland.
Igor Landau, managing director of Rhone-Poulenc, told a news conference in Paris that the merger would cut costs and have an effect on jobs, although it was too early to give details.
""It will not be in France that the impact will be most pronounced,"" he said, adding that the merger would have a positive effect on Rhone's results.
Merck will make an unspecified payment to Rhone for the 50/50 parity.
""Taking everything into account, the valuation of our business was higher than that of Merck,"" Landou said.
The joint-venture will merge the animal health activities of Rhone Merieux and Merck AgVet. It will be headed in the first few years by Merck's John Preston, while Rhone's Louis Champel will become chief executive of Merial and will succeed Preston.
Merck was No. 2 in animal health in 1995 but has been overtaken in 1996 by Novartis. Its leading product, Ivermectine, loses some of its patent protection next year but still has about eight years of sales ahead of it. Sales for this product alone in 1996 have been $750 million.
Rhone Merieux's main product is the recently launched Frontline, which has had sales this year of $85 million and are expected to double in 1997.
Merial will benefit from the launch of a number of new Merck products in the coming years while a new jointly developed product will be ready in three years.
""The real creation of added value is in innovation,"" Landau said, stressing the possible synergies of the joint research and development.
The Merial venture is the latest of a series of big corporate moves in animal health.
In 1994, American Cyanamid was bought by American Home Products Corp. In 1995 Pfizer bought the animal health business of Smithkline Beecham Plc and Rhone Merieux acquired the veterinary business of Sanofi, part of Elf Aquitaine.
In 1996 Belgium's Solvay sold its animal health business to AHP.
Landau said that Mallinckrodt, No. 9 in world animal health, was for sale but that Rhone was not interested.
Asked to comment on rumours of a merger between Rhone's Rhone-Poulenc Rorerand Sanofi, following a statement Thursday by Elf that a merger was desirable for Sanofi, Landau said Rhone was not interested in a pharmaceutical alliance.

The government said on October 16 it wanted to sell loss-making and indebted Thomson SA to books-to-missiles conglomerate Lagardere Groupe instead of to industrial and telecommunications group Alcatel Alsthom.
The government planned to sell Thomson for a symbolic franc after an 11 billion franc ($2 billion) capital increase.
Lagardere plans to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned Thomson-CSF defence electronics group with its own Matra Defence Espace into the world's second-biggest defence electronics group.
As part of its plan, it agreed to sell Thomson's wholly-owned consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea, also for a franc.
Juppe told parliament on Tuesday that he personally made the decision to favour Lagardere because it was in the best interests of the country's defence industry and job market.
The Privatisation Commission, a body of seven independent experts, is currently studying both offers and has to state whether the bids reflect the true value of Thomson and whether it agrees with the government's preference.
Its decision is expected in early December.
Normally, a privatisation can go ahead if the commission agrees with the government preference, but the sale procedure has to be restarted if the commission does not agree.
The government normally does not announce its preference but Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said he decided to do so to avoid any insider dealing in shares of Lagardere, Alcatel or Thomson-CSF.
""I don't see them turning back on their decision,"" a share trader said about the debate. ""I think they're doing this to allow them to respond to criticism and explain their decision.""
Thomson Multimedia's labour unions are upset by declarations by Juppe that their company was not worth one franc, but minus 14 billion francs, the level of its debts.
Thomson Multimedia chairman Alain Prestat told Le Monde on Tuesday the company would be automatically profitable from 1998 due to technology licensing rights.
The company made a 2.8 billion franc loss in the first half of 1996, Prestat said.
Another criticism also emerged about the way the government announced its preference before the Privatisation Commission had studied the offers.
Lionel Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party and rival to Jacques Chirac in last year's presidential elections, openly wondered whether the government had acted illegally.
""I was shocked by the method, which was despicable and perhaps even illegal,"" he told a television interviewer on October 20.

36,"There is a discreet battle raging in France over whether future competitors of a privatised France Telecom will be able to make a living or whether the playing field will be tilted against them.
With billions of francs at stake, analysts are scutinising the abstruse technical details of interconnection charges and the cost of public service.
The government expects to dispose of about 20 percent of France Telecom next April and plans eventually to selloff 49 percent of the state-owned-company.
French telecommunications minister Francois Fillon said on Tuesday that French interconnection charges would have to be ""comparable to other countries, in particular countries where there is already competition.""
Interconnection charges are the payments telecom rivals have to pay to France Telecom for the use of its network.
France Telecom confirmed a leaked document showing it planned a charge of 0.16 francs per minute for local calls, 0.18 francs for regional calls and 0.26 francs for national calls.
France Telecom says these are among the lowest in Europe, with only Britain having cheaper local interconnection charges.
But its future rivals, however, say these prices are still too high and claim they are higher than what the state-owned company uses as internal charges.
On top of the interconnection charges comes the cost for the ""public service"" -- telecoms available to everyone, everywhere in France. By law, France Telecom will run this public service and its rivals will have to share the costs.
The newspaper Les Echos recently cited a study by the Analysis research bureau showing the the costs of such a service would be nine billion francs ($1.76 billion) per year.
France Telecom's rivals, using another research bureau, arrive at a figure of 4.5 billion francs at most.
""The total interconnection charges and public service payments for a local call would be some 0.21 to 0.22 francs per minute, or some 80 percent of the current price and nearly two to three times as high as in other countries where there is competition,"" a confidential document said.
The new French telecommunications regulator, ART, which will be in place in January 1997, is expected to decide on the charges in February.
And during the first three months of the year the future telecommunications operators will apply for their licences in order to be ready for competition in 1998.
Two groups have announced intentions to become national operators. One is CEGETEL, a joint venture of Generale des Eaux, British Telecom Plc, SBC Communications Inc, and Mannesmann of Germany. The other is headed by Bouygues in association with Italy's STET and Germany's VEBA.
AT&amp;T also wants to be active in the French market, with the help of a partner, but a spokesman for the U.S. group in France declined to comment whether it was in talks with Bouygues or preparing a fourth consortium.
AT&amp;T is in talks to combine it forces in Europe with Unisource -- a joint venture of the Dutch PTT, Telia of Sweden, Swiss Telecom PTT and Spain's Telefonica.
Unisource had previously teamed up with Generale des Eaux but the latter preferred BT.
Other companies will operate on a smaller scale, targetting either a region or a specific market. Eurotunnel's Trans Manche has received a licence for Paris to London lines. Fillon said he would sign in the next few days telecom operating licences for railroad company SNCF, Colt of Britain and MFS Ltd.

36,"Market talk persists about a possible demerger of Rhone-Poulenc into a chemicals company and a pharmaceuticals group, with a leading French broker saying it would boost share value by a third.
""Intrinsically, Rhone-Poulenc is worth no more than 40 to 45 billion francs ($7.89 billion to $8.88 billion) due to the weight of underperforming chemical activities and their important debts,"" Jean Borjeix, chief analyst at Jean-Pierre Pinatton, wrote recently.
He said that if the pharmaceutical activities -- Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Fisons, Merieux and Connaught -- were separated from the chemical activities, total group value could be 60 billion francs.
""An asset gain of such a size would allow (an investor) to wait until the (demerger) operation takes place,"" Borjeix said, adding that the 1996 and 1997 results forecasts limited the downside.
Pinatton expects Rhone-Poulenc to report a stable 1996 net attributable profit of 2.05 billion francs, rising to 2.5 billion in 1997. Rhone published a net attributable profit of 2.13 billion in 1995.
Demerger rumours were first fuelled by May 28 comments by managing director Igor Landau, during a luncheon at the Roland Garros tennis tournament, saying the company had studied the possibility but had, for the time being, decided against it.
Borjeix believes the company will decide to split because management has become concerned about share holder value and also because an asset disposal policy is coming to an end.
Other analysts are less sure.
""I don't think it will happen. They will concentrate on improving margins themselves for the time being,"" said an analyst at a U.S. brokerage in London.
He also dismissed a suggestion, aired in Business Week in June, of Rhone selling its 68 percent stake in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. ""There would be no immediate benefit to that.""
Rhone shares have been rising recently, partly on the back of 9.2 percent higher first half profits and on recurring speculative rumours of a split or possible merger of the chemical activities with Atochem of Elf-Aquitaine.
Shares rose from 122.3 francs in May to 136 on June 18 on initial speculation and then fell back to 120.8 on July 24. They have resumed their rise to 131 francs, but this is still below the institutional privatisation price of 146 francs in November 1993 and the price for individuals of 135 francs. (Corrects privatisation date to November 1993 from 1994 and makes clear 146 franc price was for institutional shareholders.)
Les Echos newspaper said on July 29 that the company's board meeting of July, where the first half profit figures were approved, had also discussed the group's vulnerability to a takeover bid.
The paper said chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou was worried the insufficent profitability of the chemical sector would make the group a cheap buy for a rival.
Fourtou has made the restructuring of the chemical sector a key part of his strategy, next to a pharmaceutical expansion drive and a 10-billion-franc two-year asset sale plan.
Board member Philippe Desmarescaux was recently given control of the chemicals sector in a move which was seen as signalling that restructuring of the division would accelerate.
Rhone-Poulenc took 223 million francs in provisions for the chemicals sector in the first half and expects total 1996 group provisions to be 500 million francs.
The rumours about a chemical link-up with Elf-Aquitaine are in line with many market stories about big French combinations to stave off competition in world markets -- the same reasoning caused rumours Elf would merge with Total SA.
At Elf, where chairman Philippe Jaffre is also trying to boost profitability with cost cuts and asset sales, the Atochem unit is doing fine, even though sales fell in the first half.
Jacques Puechal, the pipe-smoking chairman of the division, has embarked on a selective acquisition policy bolstered by a surge in 1995 net attributable profit of five billion francs, against 1.8 billion in the previous year.
On Wednesday, Paris broker Leven SA issued a ""speculative buy"" advice on Rhone Poulenc shares, after having been ""neutral"". Leven said the company's debt remained a worry but it appreciated developments in the drugs division and noted rumours of a demerger. ($1=5.068 French Franc)

36,"French energy group Total SA on Wednesday reported a 50 percent rise in its 1996 net income to 5.6 billion francs ($1 billion), boosted by higher oil prices, a firmer dollar, improved refining margins and productivity gains.
The profit figure, which was in line with financial analysts' expectations, would have shown a 150 percent increase if 1995 special charges of 1.5 billion francs were taken into account.
Operating income rose by 37 percent to 10.2 billion francs on 30 percent higher sales of 176 billion francs.
Total chairman Thierry Desmarest said the profit improvement compared with rises of some 25 percent at U.S. oil majors.
Larger French group Elf in December said its 1996 net income would be between 7.3 and 7.5 billion francs compared with 5.3 billion in 1995, or some 40 percent higher.
Total shares initially rose on the figures but closed down 0.55 percent at 471.50 francs while the CAC-40 blue chip index was down 0.71 percent.
""The market had anticipated the increase in results. The figures were in line with expectations,"" an analyst said.
Total said that external factors had contributed two billion francs to the rise in operating income.
""A more favourable operating environment in 1996 than 1995 accounts for more than half of (the) 3.3 billion franc increase in operating income,"" Total said.
The U.S. dollar rose to an average rate of 4.99 francs in 1995 to 5.12 francs in 1996, Brent oil rose to 20.7 per barrel from $17.04 per barrel while the refining margins improved to $13.6 per tonne from $11.4 per tonne.
Productivity gains contributed 500 million francs to the improvement and higher volumes 1.1 billion. An increase in operating expenses trimmed the total gain by 300 million.
Desmarest said he expected the oil price to slip in 1997, due to the return of Iraq to the market and higher production by non OPEC members, but he expected it not to fall as far as the 1994/1995 low of $16.40 a barrel.
""I do not think that we will continue to see the favourable prices from the start of the year,"" Desmarest said. ""But it is very unlikely that it will return to a level of $16.40 per barrel.""
Total expects a further increase in profits but Desmarest declined to be drawn into precise forecasts.
""Continuing production growth and ongoing productivity gains projected over the next few years should allow the company to improve profitability relative to the 1996 level of return on equity."" Total said.
Desmarest told the news conference that he aimed to get a four billion franc increase in the years up to 1999. ""For the next three years, and with unchanged circumstances, we aim to improve the operating results by four billion francs,"" he said.
Total aims to boost its investments in 1997 to 18 billion francs, from 16 billion in 1995, with the lion's share going to upstream activities -- exploration and production.
Desmarest said that by the year 2000, he expected about half of the company's operating income to come from exploration and production, while both the downstream and chemicals activities would have a slice of 20 to 25 percent.
Total aims to have reserves to allow it to tap into more than one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year 2000 and planned further growth after that.
In downstream, refining and marketing, Total is still faced with a weak European market.
Desmarest said the company was ready to participate in a restructuring of the refining industry but he did not plan to shut Total's refineries. Instead he was willing to offer access to the refineries to other operators in exchange for closures.

36,"A French parliamentary commission said on Wednesday that it approved a planned merger between Anglo-French industrial power group GEC Alsthom and state-controlled nuclear engineering group Framatome.
But it attached a number of conditions to its approval that go beyond the terms set by Industry Minister Franck Borotra.
The Socialist members of the commission, however, said they opposed the privatisation of Framatome and they feared four to five thousand of the company's 19,000 jobs could be lost.
GEC Alsthom is a joint venture between France's Alcatel Alsthom and Britain's General Electric Co Plc.
The French government in August gave the go-ahead for a merger study between GEC Alsthom and Framatome, the world's biggest maker of nuclear power stations.
Framatome competes against Swiss-Swedish ABB, Germany's Siemens, Mitsubishi of Japan, and U.S. firms General Electric and Westinghouse.
Alcatel has a 44 percent stake in Framatome, with the rest in the hands of French state groups CEA, EDF and CDR.
The commission said in a statement that after six weeks of study and talks, it had concluded that a merger had undeniable advantages and even found that it would be ""suicidal"" for Framatome to try and survive the next 10 to 15 years on its own because few nuclear stations are expected to be ordered.
The commission put down nine conditions to the merger.
It said the group had to be French, which means that Framatome has to absorb GEC Alsthom, which is a joint-venture under Dutch law, and not the reverse.
It also wants French shareholders to have control for as long the group is unlisted and a blocking minority when it is listed.
It said the nuclear activities of Framatome had to be put in a special subsidiary of the new group and public authorities should have a right of veto on strategic decisions.
It said the cash reserves of this unit should be at least equal to a provision for nuclear risks, or the cost of decommissioning plants, estimated at 6.5 billion francs ($1.24 billion).
The commission said cooperation with Siemens on the development of a new European nuclear reactor should continue and the parliamentarians suggested a share swap between the nuclear subsidiary and Siemens's KWU unit.
The commission also called for a new cooperation deal between Framatome, CEA and electricity utility EDF as well as for an extension to 2011 of an agreement between Framatome and nuclear material group Cogema on fuel rods.
Finally, the commission said parliament should have control over the nuclear activities.
It said all nine conditions were ""non-negotiable"".
Borotra's conditions include French identity, the Siemens link, a French majority stake and provisions for nuclear risks.
GEC has let it be known that it wants a stake equal to that of Alcatel in the new group and that it does not want to end up a minority shareholder.
Framatome had net attributable profit of 663 million francs in 1995 on sales of 17.9 billion.
GEC Alsthom had operating income of 2.6 billion francs in 1995 on sales of 29.3 billion francs.

36,"French State-owned aerospace group Aerospatiale said on Saturday it could make a bid for defence electronics group Thomson-CSF with Dassault Aviation if it obtained government permission.
The Le Monde newspaper said Alcatel Alsthom could also join the project to form a big French defence group in response to last week's merger announcement of Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
Aerospatiale spokesman Patrice Kreis told Reuters on Saturday that Aerospatiale and fighter plane maker Dassault, in merger talks themselves, were not at the moment actively preparing an offer to acquire Thomson-CSF.
""At the moment, and I say that after having talked to the boss -- chairman Yves Michot -- a few minutes ago, at the moment we are not working on an offer."" But he confirmed that the chairmen had expressed an interest in acquiring Thomson-CSF.
Kreis said the companies had to await the terms of the new procedure for the sale of Thomson-CSF, expected in January, and for the green light from the state as shareholder.
""We will see in January whether we will work on one or not. If we are authorised to do so, we will, but only after we now the terms of the (sale) procedure,"" he said.
A Ministry of Defence official told Reuters: ""It is certain that Yves Michot and (Dassault Aviation chairman) Serge Dassault are working on an offer.""
""If Aerospatiale and Dassault wanted to make an offer for Thomson-CSF, the government ... would allow them to,"" Le Monde quoted a Ministry of Defence source as saying.
At Alcatel Alsthom there was no immediate comment.
In February President Jacques Chirac launched the sale of Thomson SA and urged the merger between Aerospatiale and Dassault as a first step in an industry shake-up.
Thomson SA has a 58 percent stake in Thomson-CSF, the remainder being listed on the Paris Bourse. It also has 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
In October, the government said it preferred a bid by Lagardere Groupe over one by Alcatel Alsthom.
Lagardere would buy Thomson SA for one franc after a 14 billion franc capital increase and would sell TMM to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea. Lagardere planned a a bid on the other 42 percent of Thomson-CSF and would merge the company with its Matra Defense Espace unit.
The independent Privatisation Commission objected to the TMM sale and the government suspended the procedure early December.
The government has since decided to sell Thomson-CSF seperately in early in 1997 and wait with the TMM until 1998.
On Friday, the government said it would announce the terms of the Thomson-CSF sale in early January. One of the issues it has to resolve is whether to decide on a public float or a new tender for an industry sale.
Thomson chairman Marcel Roulet is campaigning for a float.
The Aerospatiale spokesman said on Saturday that a link with Lagardere was not logical but one with Alcatel was. ""It is true that Aerospatiale and Dassault are competitors of Matra, but we are complementary to Alcatel and Thomson-CSF.""
Aerospatiale is the French partner in the Airbus Industrie consortium with British Aerospace Plc, Germany's Daimler Aerospace and Spain's CASA.
""When the Boeing-McDonnell merger was announced people said that it was a threat to Airbus and that it had to speed up its integration. But that is not true, the merger is mainly a Pentagon project,"" an industry source said.
""Boeing-McDonnell also have Rockwell -- the American Thomson-CSF -- (and) their merger is mainly a defence industry challenge,"" the source added.

36,"French state agencies met on Friday to rubber stamp an 11 billion franc ($2.09 billion) capital injection of state aid in electronics group Thomson SA, as the government reviewed options for reviving its sale.
Thomson labour unions, with the support of many other labour groups, were planning a big demonstration in Paris later to demand the total cancellation of the group's privatisation after its controversial sale was suspended earlier this week.
Finance Minister Jean Arthuis, under political pressure to come up quickly with ways to restore France's reputation on international markets, was working on how to relaunch the sale process.
He must also find ways to mollify South Korea, which was outraged by the decision to suspend the privatisation because the independent Privatisation Commission did not agree with the terms of the planned sale of Thomson's consumer electronics subsidiary Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics.
Inside Thomson's Paris headquarters state shareholders were holding an extraordinary meeting to vote on the capital increase that is needed to bolster the company's balance sheet ahead of a sale.
Representatives of France Telecom and the CDR state holding company, which owns former Credit Lyonnais assets, met to agree the aid package, which has also to win approval from the European Commission in Brussels.
A spokesman for Dutch-based  Philips Electronics denied a rumour the company had lodged an official complaint.
One issue that Arthuis has to settle is whether to restart the sale from the beginning and invite new tenders, or to limit negotiations to the two finalists in the orginal process -- the winner Lagardere Groupe and Alcatel Alsthom.
He must also decide whether to abandon France's preference for the defence and electronics group to be sold as a whole rather than in parts. Arthuis has said he his willing to consider a split before a sale.
The influential Les Echos financial newspaper said on Friday that if the government insisted on a package sale, Alcatel Alsthom stood the best chances of winning. Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk recently suggested the state should sell Thomson SA as a whole, but in tranches.
If the government accepted a split, Lagardere Groupe could still obtain control of 58-percent defence unit Thomson-CSF, Les Echos said.
Whatever the solution, Arthuis faces a series of problems.
South Korea's Deputy Prime Minister Han Seung-son told French ambassador Dominique Perreau in Seoul on Friday that the Thomson decision had ""caused worries to many people"" in South Korea.
French companies have recently won huge orders from Korea, including a TGV high-speed train deal, and are vying for a multi-billion combat aircraft order.
Another problem is the risk of a spillover into other privatisations. International investors are expressing their dislike of the French decision and trades unions see the climbdown at Thomson as a sign they can win elsewhere.
The Communist-led CGT union said on Friday the government should also suspend the planned sale of France Telecom. Billed as  France's biggest stock market flotation, it is set for next spring. ($1=5.270 French Franc)

36,"Daewoo Electronics on Tuesday tried to placate French critics of its planned purchase of Thomson Multimedia with job and investment promises while calling a counter-bid ""not realistic""
But Bae Soon-hoon, chairman of the South Korean company, declined to discuss financial details of the proposed takeover until the French government's decision to sell the world's fourth-biggest television maker became final.
Both the French Privatisation Commission and the European Commission still have to approve the deal.
The French government announced last week it had selected Lagardere Groupe over Alcatel Alsthom to buy state-owned Thomson SA for one franc after an 11 billion franc ($2.12 billion) capital injection.
Lagardere plans to merge its Matra Defence Espace unit with defence electronics group Thomson-CSF and sell off Thomson Multimedia (TMM) to Daewoo, also for one franc.
The French financial newspaper La Tribune on Monday suggested a rival French bid for TMM could still emerge. The Liberation daily on Tuesday said Sagem, which fell out of the race earlier on, was preparing such a bid.
Sagem denied planning a bid, however, and the idea was dismissed by Bae.
""I saw the newspaper article. I thought it was a joke,"" he said. ""We have been working with the government for six months and have been respecting the rules of the procedure. Unless the government changes the procedure, nobody can make a proposal at the present time.""
Bae said he planned to make Thomson Multimedia, reported to have made a three billion franc first half loss and to have debts of at least 14 billion, ""very profitable and prosperous.""
He confirmed a pledge to create 5,000 French jobs at TMM in five years, saying French labour conditions were competitive.
The partnership between Thomson Multimedia and Daewoo, which will create the world's biggest maker of televisions, video recorders and cathode ray tubes, would allow a 13 billion franc worldwide investment plan between now and 2000.
Daewoo said that would create a total of 6,600 jobs in final assembly and 2,500 jobs in component production.
Bae declined to indicate how much of Thomson Multimedia's debt Daewoo would assume but said he expected some of the state capital injection to go to TMM.
""The Daewoo group will keep a significant part of the TMM debts and has the means to do so,"" said Michel Jacob, managing director of Daewoo's French financial advisers Rothschild's.
Daewoo said it would keep the Thomson identity and French headquarters and would continue research and development in the French city of Rennes. It said all the group's products would be sold under Thomson brand names in Europe and the U.S.
The digital television know-how of Thomson will be put in a special joint venture with Lagardere. Bae said the joint-venture would be 50/50 owned, while Jean-Luc Lagardere said on Saturday his group would have a 51 percent majority.
The government decision to sell TMM indirectly for one franc to Daewoo has attracted fierce criticism, with Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin saying he was ""shocked"".
Jacques Delors, former president of the European Commission, said at the weekend: ""I would have preferred to maintain a European pole in consumer electronics.""
Some Thomson labour unions have also attacked the sale of ""French technology"" to a South Korean company. ($1=5.199 French Franc)

34,"The Czech government on Tuesday approved the text of a long-awaited declaration on post-World War Two reconciliation with Germany, paving the way for its initialling on Friday.
The declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland region of what was then Czechoslovakia.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told reporters after a weekly government meeting that he had been authorised to sign the text, which took two years to negotiate, without changes.
""The government has closed the debate by this text and it sees no chance, opportunity or reason to make any changes to it...Negotiation on the text has ended for us, I'm saying that unambiguously,"" Klaus said.
The foreign ministers of the two countries are now due to initial the text in the Czech capital on Friday. Signature by the two presidents and confirmation by the parliaments are expected early next year.
""In this declaration it is clearly stated that the will of both sides is to close the past, to close the negative chapters of our history. This declaration means a clear turn in our relations toward the future,"" Klaus said.
The text has angered groups representing families of the Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate for property lost during the expulsions.
Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU), the political sponsor of the expelled Germans which has in the past hinted it might use its weight in the Bonn government to block the declaration, has given qualified support to the text.
But on Tuesday the CSU government of Bavaria, home of most expellees, made a number of demands.
It said it could accept the declaration only if both Bavaria and the official Sudeten German representatives were allowed to participate in a planned fund for German-Czech projects.
And it picked up a key condition which Prague has so far rejected, saying that it expected a commitment, ""no later than when the declaration is signed, that the Czech side will hold talks with the representatives of the Sudeten German community"".
In the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.
Members of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, have said they still had concerns about vague wording on compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million) and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that to finance ""projects of common interest"" including joint environmental, historical and scientific projects and youth meetings.
But the text adds: ""The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National Socialist violence.""

34,"The Czech Republic's sole supplier of natural gas, Russia's Gazprom, has agreed to start talks on a long-term supply deal, Industry and Trade minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Tuesday.
He said the talks would focused on a contract for supplies of 8.9 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year.
""Today's offer respects this conclusion (of the Czech government to diversify supplies),"" Dlouhy told a news conference after meeting Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev.
""That means supplies of only 8.9 bcm, and an agreement to start negotiations on a long-term contract. I consider this to be a good result,"" he said.
The Czech Republic currently imports all of its roughly nine bcm of natural gas a year from Gazprom under a three-year contract ending in 1998, extendable for another three years.
Dlouhy said Gazprom had accepted that the Czechs want to partially diversify their gas supplies.
""Until now, they have been trying to save the 100 percent coverage. Today they came with an offer -- not all supplies from Russia,"" he added.
The consumption is expected to rise to about 12 to 13 bcm per year in several years. The country wants to cover the increase from alternative sources.
Dlouhy's deputy, Miroslav Tvrznik, told reporters that the aim was to bring the contract with Gazprom to ""a European standard of 15 to 25 years"".
Dlouhy said talks would start with several potential partners to choose how to diversify the supplies. These talks would be included in a report to the full cabinet which should make a ""more concrete"" decision next January, Dlouhy said.
""We would want to have the first supplies from diversified sources already in the year 1997,"" he said.
He added that some of the options would include buying Russian gas through an intermediary, possibly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany's Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF.
Dlouhy said these partners would provide a guarantee of supplying from their own sources in case of emergency.
He also said an earlier announced option of buying some gas from Norway was still under consideration, and said that Germany's  BEB Erdgas und Erdoil, or U.S.-based Mobil could serve as ""supplementary sources"".

34,"Disgruntled Czech opposition Social Democrats have blamed party chairman Milos Zeman for their poor showing in weekend elections for the country's new Senate.
They suggested that charges by Zeman ahead of the elections that intelligence agents had harassed himself and his mother had backfired on the party, which had been neck and neck with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.
In the event, the Social democrats won only 20.3 percent of the vote in first round voting held on Friday and Saturday. This compared with 36.5 percent for the ODS, led by conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
While the ODS called a news conference on Monday to trumpet its dominant showing, leading Social Democrats went to ground after a weekend of squabbling over who was to blame.
Vasil Biben, Social Democrat candidate in the north Bohemian town of Trutnov, was blunt in his criticism of Zeman.
""The Social Democrats were were hurt by his pre-election excesses, thanks to which the party lost centre-left voters,"" the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Biben, who will fight a second round run-off this weekend, as saying.
Shortly before the polls Zeman alleged secret agents had tried to extract compromising information from his elderly mother.
Earlier he had caused uproar when he accused the state intelligence agency BIS of spying on him. But he failed to provide evidence to a parliamentary watchdog and earned a rebuke from President Vaclav Havel.
The Social Democrats divided roughly into those who back Zeman and those who support four rebel deputies who voted with Klaus's coalition in a parliamentary budget vote last month.
Low turnout also hit the centre-left party, which did so well in general parliamentary six months ago that Klaus's centre-right coalition lost its parliamentary majority.
Only 34 percent of the electorate bothered to vote for the newly-created Senate (upper house), which few Czechs seem to understand. But the pro-business ODS proved much better at getting its supporters out than the opposition.
The Social Democrats failed to win most votes in any constituency, although their candidates went through to the second round in 48 of the 81 constituencies by finishing second.
Afterwards Zeman blamed the rebels, who included one of his vice-chairmen, Karel Machovec, for the setback. The defection in early October triggered public squabbling between the party's right wing and former communist colleagues.
Zeman dismissed the row over the BIS as a factor, citing a poll taken before the spy scandal broke which showed a sharp drop in the willingness of Czechs to vote again so soon after general elections.
""When I analyse what happened, and see that this opinion poll preceded the BIS affair, then I can find only one cause and that is the budget vote,"" he said.
One Social democrat rebel, Jozef Wagner, described this as nonsense.
Wagner, who chairs the parliamentary budget committee, noted that the BIS affair had been broken not by Zeman but by Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's coalition.
Wagner said the Social Democrats should have stayed quiet in the affair, which cost the job of the BIS acting director.

34,"The Czech government on Tuesday approved the text of a long-awaited declaration on post-World War Two reconciliation with Germany, paving the way for its initialling on Friday.
The declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland region of what was then Czechoslovakia.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told reporters after a weekly government meeting that he had been authorised to sign the text, which took two years to negotiate, without changes.
""The government has closed the debate by this text and it sees no chance, opportunity or reason to make any changes to it...Negotiation on the text has ended for us, I'm saying that unambiguously,"" Klaus said.
The foreign ministers of the two countries are now due to initial the text in the Czech capital on Friday. Signature by the two presidents and confirmation by the parliaments are expected early next year.
""In this declaration it is clearly stated that the will of both sides is to close the past, to close the negative chapters of our history. This declaration means a clear turn in our relations toward the future,"" Klaus said.
The text has angered groups representing families of the Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate for lost property during the expulsions.
Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU), political sponsor of the expelled Germans, said its support for the text was not guaranteed.
Final approval from the CSU, a partner in the Bonn coalition, would depend on assurances that the Sudetens would be ""involved at an appropriate level"" in a dialogue between Prague and Bonn.
The Bavarian-based CSU has in the past hinted it could use its weight in the government to block the declaration or oppose the Czech Republic's application to join the European Union unless the Sudetens were given better terms.
In the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.
Members of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, have said they still had concerns about vague wording on compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million) and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that to finance ""projects of common interest"" including joint environmental, historical and scientific projects and youth meetings.
But the text adds: ""The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National Socialist violence.""

34,"Czech engineering group Skoda a.s. said on Tuesday it had won an order to supply trolleybuses worth more than $170 million to the city of San Francisco, the largest order of Czech goods ever to the United States.
Skoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec said the electrically powered buses would be produced in the Czech Republic and assembled at Skoda's subsidiary, Electric Transit International (ETI) in Baltimore.
""We consider victory in this tender to be an extraordinary success not only in view of the expected volumes of supplies ... but also because the U.S. market is among the most prestigious and demanding in the world,"" Hudec said.
Plzen-based Skoda, no longer affiliated with the Czech car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s., has made an aggressive push into new markets, aiming to offer western-quality units with the comparative cost advantage of eastern European production.
The San Francisco contract would open the way for Skoda, an engineering conglomerate which makes goods ranging from nuclear power components to drink cans, to win more business in the United States, Hudec said.
""Considering the ecologization of public transport in the U.S., Skoda Plzen has real chances to win further orders... and also bring the brand Skoda to the U.S. market ...,"" he said.
Electric Transit International (ETI) President Ladislav Tetal said the order would virtually replace San Francisco's entire fleet of 300 buses, as the city retains only a few dozen younger vehicles.
He said the deal had no connection with San Francisco's landmark cablecar lines which will continue to be a symbol of the ""City by the Bay.""
The total for the order with details of the financial and technical conditions would be finalised by mid-year, Hudec said, but declined to give further details.
The deal must still be approved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in a vote scheduled for April 22, ETI said.
Skoda has made more than 12,000 trolleybuses since 1936 -- many of which can be seen running in cities throughout the former communist bloc.
Earlier this decade Skoda won a contract to supply 54 trolley buses to the city of Dayton, Ohio, and founded a U.S. joint venture with private partners in Baltimore, ETI, to assemble the buses. Skoda holds a majority stake in ETI.
The Dayton supply is scheduled to be completed in 1998. Skoda said it is also pursuing joint ventures to build trolley buses in Russia and Iran.

34,"A debate in the Czech parliament over a sensitive post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany dragged into a third day on Thursday, with small opposition parties trying various tactics to obstruct a vote.
Supporters of the Czech-German declaration, aimed at putting to rest more than 50 years of lingering political questions over World War Two and its aftermath, have tried to limit debate but a quick conclusion appeared unlikely.
The ultra-right Czech Republican Party, vehemently opposed to the declaration which has already been signed by the Prague and Bonn governments and approved by the German parliament, submitted its own counter-declaration.
In an unruly morning session of the Czech lower house, Republican deputy Josef Krejsa put forward a proposal calling for 305 billion marks ($180 billion) in compensation for the Nazi occupation of Czech lands, along with the freezing of all German assets in the Czech Republic until the money is paid.
Political analysts said the Republican intitiative had virtually no chance of being approved, but it formed the basis for a continuing series of speeches and tactics aimed at obstructing a final vote.
In the declaration, Bonn expresses regret for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of Czech lands and Prague expresses its sorrow for brutality in the post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.
It also sets up a fund for compensating victims of Nazi aggression, but does not address the issue of direct compensation for ethnic Germans whose property was expropriated.
The Republicans and the unreformed Communist Party say the declaration lets Germany off lightly for Nazi attrocities and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.
Bonn considers individual property questions still open but the Czech government has rejected this interpretation.
With the debate getting increasingly nasty, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus called an emergency meeting of his cabinet on Thursday in an effort to kill the Republican filibuster which threatens to go on for days.
The meeting resulted in a cabinet boycott of Thursday's regular parliamentary question and answer session, and a call for the house's immunity committee to investigate whether Republicans broke house rules, or the law, with abusive comments.
In an example of the tenor of the debate, Krejsa called Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Vondra ""the anal speleologist of the awakening German empire"" for negotiating the deal with Bonn.
The Czech lower house suspended its rules to allow debate to continue all night and into Saturday if necessary, but Klaus indicated a decision might not come before next week.
He called on parliament to suspend its plans to take a nine-day break after the Saturday session.
""The government considers it to be beneficial that the chamber continues next week in the debate on the open item (declaration)... it will try after an agreement with all of you to find a way how this will be possible to be secured,"" Klaus told the house. ($ = 1.684 German Marks)

34,"Pope John Paul arrived in Prague on Friday, saying he hoped his visit to the Czech Republic would bring a new step forward in the spiritual growth of all Czechs.
The 76-year old Pontiff, on his third visit to Prague since the fall of communism in 1989, was greeted at the airport by President Vaclav Havel and other Czech political and religious leaders.
Some 200 schoolchildren waved yellow and white Vatican flags as the Pope slowly descended the aircraft steps and shook Havel's hand before touching a bowl of Czech earth.
Pope John Paul said in a speech he hoped his visit would help bring about ""a fresh step forward in the ever-increasing spiritual and ethical growth"" of all Czechs.
He paid tribute to Havel, a former dissident playwright who spent several years in jail under communism, as being ""among those who brought about the rebirth of this country"".
The Pope is in the Czech Republic chiefly to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the death of St Adalbert, the first Czech bishop who also took the gospel to Poland.
Adalbert, or Vojtech in Czech, is seen by Catholics as a figure of spiritual significance for Europeans of all denominations.
""I am certain that the heritage of Christian values of which St Adalbert was a special witness in times marked by ignorance and cruelty will not leave indifferent those who, although far from belief, have at heart the civil, cultural and spiritual roots which have so profoundly marked the history of your homeland,"" the Pope said.
He also paid tribute to late Czech Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, who for 40 years championed religious freedom in communist Czechoslovakia and died in 1992.
""He will certainly be rejoicing in heaven to see me return among his people...History is truly guided by the almighty hand of God,"" he said.
Havel said in his speech that Adalbert cherished a dream of European spiritual unity and saw his Czech homeland as part of the Christian community of the continent.
""This community was to be based on a spiritual and moral renewal and on readiness to embrace common values -- which is needed today just as it was then,"" Havel said.
The president said the martyred saint had left a legacy of peace, integration and unity which was shared by the many European nations commemorating his millennium.
The Pope's last visit to the Czech Republic, in May 1995, proved controversial when he canonised Jan Sarkander, tortured to death by Protestants in 1620. Some Protestants say Sarkander was a traitor who encouraged a Catholic invasion.
But Havel said Adalbert's tradition did not divide Czechs among themselves or with others.
""It unites our people across denominations and serves as a bridge linking us with our Central European neighbours as well as with other nations,"" he said.
The Pope, whose health has been fragile in recent years, walked slowly but unassisted and stood to deliver his speech.
He is to mark Adalbert's death with a mass for young people in the town of Hradec Kralove, some 100 km (60 miles) from Prague, on Saturday and hold another open air mass and an ecumenical service in the capital on Sunday.

34,"Czech consumer prices rose by what some analysts considered a surprisingly low 0.2 percent in August, after 1.0 percent in July, to put prices 9.6 percent up on the same month in 1995.
The result surprised analysts although it kept average inflation well over the government's 1996 target of eight percent.
Radek Maly, an economist with Citibank in Prague, said: ""It is very low, I expected the month-on month inflation to be over 0.6 percent, and the year-on-year figure to get over ten percent.""
The Statistical Bureau (CSU) said a hike in regulated natural gas and power prices sparked a 3.2 percent month-on-month increase in housing prices, the main impetus for August inflation.
Food, beverages and tobacco products actually showed a price drop in August of 1.4 percent, thanks to a 29.5 percent fall in potato prices and 25.9 percent decrease of vegetables.
""What was totally surprising to me was the fall in the foods index, and considering its (large) weighting, it obviously pulled the whole figure down. The whole structure looks very well,"" Maly said.
The CSU in July raised its average inflation forecast for the whole year to 9.0 percent, and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the cabinet based its 1997 budget calculations on an inflation expectation of ""not below"" eight percent.
Klaus did not specify if he meant the year-on-year or the moving average rate.
Maly said the August result might help the 1996 figure to finish below nine percent, but nowhere near the government's earlier target.
The government has said it would aim to cut inflation by one percentage point every year after 1995's rate of nine percent.

34,"A plan on how the Czech Republic will diversify natural gas supplies, now coming solely from Russia, has been delayed for several weeks, the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Tuesday.
""We are gathering information, analysing it, and it's going to take several weeks (before the issue is put before the government),"" ministry spokesman Miroslav Konvalina said.
A plan had been expected to be submitted to the government sometime in January. Konvalina gave no reason for the delay.
Officials have declined to say which partners the government was considering, though government representatives have held talks on limited deliveries from Norway.
The ministry is drawing up plans for four options for securing gas supplies, but has given no details. No matter which plan is accepted, Russia is expected to remain the dominant supplier.
It said the four options being considered are:
- Purchasing all natural gas from Gazprom, using two different shipping routes, with a long-term agreement until 2016, with price guarantees until 1998.
- Purchasing some Russian gas indirectly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany's Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF AG. Gasunie would start supplies in 1998, delivering up to two billion cubic metres in 2005, with the agreement lasting until 2014.
In case of a fall in Russian supplies, it would deliver its own gas through Wingas, a joint venture of Wintershall (65 percent) and Gazprom (35 percent).
Wintershall offers a similar scheme, with deliveries starting on January 1 next year, rising to one billion cubic metres in 2000, under a deal until 2016. Negotiations with these firms are in the stage of initiating a supply contract.
- Finalising and maintaining the agreement for Norwegian gas, which was given preliminary approval this year, until 2017.
- A limited purchase from Mobil Europe Gas Inc, Germany's Brigitta Erdgas und Erdoel (BEB) and British Gas Plc .
The Czechs have ended their dependance on Russian crude oil by building a new pipeline to Germany, but are still completely dependant on supplies provided by Russia's Gazprom.
The Czech Republic consumes around eight to nine billion cubic metres of natural gas per year, but volumes are expected to rise to some 12-13 billion cubic metres by the turn of the century.

34,"The party of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus performed strongly in Senate elections on Saturday but with turnout at 35 percent, the real winner was apathy.
In what was billed as a key test of the minority coalition government, Klaus's centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) took a commanding 36.47 percent of the first round vote, with the opposition Social Democrats trailing on 20.27 percent.
The result was a major improvement for the ODS, which won only 29.6 percent in elections to the lower house in June when a strong Social Democrat performance of 26.4 percent stripped Klaus's three-party coalition of its majority.
Klaus, the father of Czech economic reform, played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance.
""It is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability,"" he told reporters, alluding to the political stalemate since the inconclusive lower house polls.
""These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the (June) elections. In this respect they are giving an important signal,"" he said.
Klaus also sidestepped questions on whether he might seek early lower house elections to try to regain his majority.
But analysts said the results may be misleading. Unlike the lower house system of proportional representation, the Senate is elected in two rounds of a first-past-the-post system.
Only three ODS candidates won outright in the first round held on Friday and Saturday. Another 76 face a run-off on November 22-23 between the top two contenders in constitiuencies where no-one won more than half the first round vote.
Also, the well-organised and funded ODS is better at rallying support when public interest in elections is low than the Social Democrats. Klaus cannot therefore automatically rely on repeating the performance in a lower house election, when turnout is usually over 75 percent.
But the dismal turnout vindicated more the far-right Republicans, who boycotted the elections to the newly-created upper house and told fellow Czechs to do likewise.
The Central Election Commission said turnout was just 35.03 percent, far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections in June.
Zeman, whose party has been afflicted by squabbling, appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result.
But he added: ""I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates.""
In the end the Republicans led by doctor of philosophy Miroslav Sladek came out looking best without even running.
Sladek hit a chord by denouncing the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent rally.
Polls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate, which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies. With a few exceptions, most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house.

6,"Tomkins Plc, the British baking-to-engineering combine, reported a sharp surge in half year profits on Monday but snuffed out hopes of a share buy-back for now as its chairman flagged possible acquisitions instead.
Pretax profits for the six months to November 2 rose 34 percent to 168.8 million pounds ($284 million), with the dividend up to 3.06 pence from 2.7 pence the preceding year.
Gregory Hutchings, executive chairman, said the results marked ""another period of outperformance for Tomkins"".
But Tomkins shares saw earlier gains slip away as buy-back hopes were dashed and profit-takers cashed in their spoils from last week's gains. This left Tomkins down 3 1/2 pence at 274 in an upbeat market by mid-afternoon.
Hutchings ruled out the possibility of returning Tomkins's 366.8 million pound cash-pile to shareholders this year. ""We see sufficient (acquisition) opportunities to hold on to our cash for the time being,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
The group was likely to make a number of smaller buys. ""It won't be one major deal, but it could be worth up to 200 million pounds,"" he said. If the acquisition opportunities failed to come through the group would reconsider ways of returning value to investors, he added.
One trader summed up market sentiment. ""The main thing is the chairman has knocked speculation about a share buy-back on the head. The shares have had a good run and they were great results and a lot of people would be looking to take profits now,"" he said.
Tomkins was disappointed by the reaction to its latest set of bumper profits, blaming the anti-conglomerate climate which has buffeted shares in major firms such as Hanson Plc, mid-way through its demerger.
The results showed earnings per share growth for the 12th year in a row and the outlook for the second half was also seen as promising.
""Prospects for the second half look encouraging, with the majority of our operations having healthy order books and satisfactory market conditions. We are delighted with the purchase of Gates (Corp for $1.1 billion last year) which has proved entirely consistent with our expectations,"" said Hutchings.
Looking at a divisional breakdown, Gates contributed 259.5 million in sales and 20 million in profit in its first 14 weeks. It is seen turning in eventual savings of $12 million per annum and the group plans capital expenditure of $85 million a year.
Fluid controls saw sales of 189.2 million, with profits of 19 million versus 15.8 million.
Industry services saw sales rise to 219 million, with profits of 12.5 million versus 12.1 million. Professional garden and leisure products, including the Smith &amp; Wesson gun-maker, saw sales of 276 million and profits down to 8.5 million from 8.9 million.
Industrial products sales rose to 317.3 million, with profits of 34.3 million versus 28.5 million. Milling and baking, which includes the Hovis bread brand, saw sales up to 351.3 million, with profits at 15.4 million versus 13.7 million.
Food products, which includes Bisto gravy and the Robertson jam range, saw sales up to 543.5 million, with profits at 42.6 million versus 38.5 million. Excluding currency effects, organic growth in group operating profit was up more than 10 percent on sales which rose by seven percent.
Unlike other major export groups, Tomkins has so far been left unscathed by the pound surging against the dollar and mark owing to its hedging policy. Its mark-denominated business was minimal, it said.
On market conditions, Tomkins said the outlook for the United States was to remain firm, with Britain described as mixed. The French market is expected to continue to suffer due to economic problems. However, its French sales are very small. ($1=.5950 Pound)

6,"Eurotunnel Plc, the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator, said on Tuesday that its traffic will be cut to one third of normal levels after a fire swept through one of its main tunnels on Monday night, injuring eight people.
Services have been terminated until the tunnel affected is cleared. A Eurotunnel spokesman in London said there was no fixed time for when services would resume or how long reduced capacity will operate once the tunnel is opened.
News of the fire and worries about the extent of damage and a resultant safety review hit Eurotunnel's shares in both London and Paris.
The fire is the latest issue to dog Eurotunnel's performance which has been plagued by negotiations to rejig nine billion pounds ($15 billion) in debt.
In London, Eurotunnel shares fell 3-1/2 pence to 88 pence while in Paris the stock was down around two percent at 7.68 francs per share. But trading in its debt was barely changed.
Commenting on the initial impact on traffic, a Eurotunnel spokesman in London said, ""We will operate at one third of normal capacity and we will give priority to Eurostar (passenger) trains. But there will still be space for shuttle trains as well.""
He did not say how many Eurostar or Le Shuttle trains would be cancelled as a result.
The Tunnel's operations were closed after a fire engulfed part of one of two tunnels, near to Calais where parties from France and Britain had been holding a safety conference.
The Eurotunnel spokesman said it did not yet know the full extent of damage to rolling stock or the tunnel itself or how much it could cost, but admitted it was a ""very ferocious fire.""
""It's quite messy down there. There will be damage to the overhead powerline cables, the heat will have buckled the steel rails and the carriages involved would be very badly damaged and may need to be replaced,"" he said.
The cost of a new train is 25 million pounds, but Eurotunnel did not think an entire train would need replacing. But Eurotunnel faces costs in repairing tunnel and rolling stock damage and may face compensation costs, possibly involving paying for customers to travel by ferry or air.
The company said at this stage that it does not know the cause of the fire. But unconfirmed media reports say the fire began in a truck carrying inflammable polystyrene.
The heavy goods vehicle shuttles are known to have partially open sides -- the safety of which had been questioned by the British fire brigade some years before.
Mike Frattini, fire officer and spokesman for the Kent Fire Brigade which helped put out the tunnel fire, said earlier: ""Our chief officer warned the safety committee (for the tunnel) five years ago.""
Fire fighters could raise this objection again as part of the investigation which will go to the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel Safety Authority.
If the current goods carriages are deemed to be hazardous in light of the accident there could be a call for changes, incurring further costs to Eurotunnel.
Eurotunnel's spokesman refused to comment on whether changes will need to be made to carriages, adding that ""It is a key question.""
The fire comes just before Christmas when the tunnel was expected to see a surge in holiday sales. But pre-holiday publicity now consists of media reports of choking people emerging from smoke and ""blow-torch""-like heat.
Asked whether this would dampen customer demand, Eurotunnel said ""We hope not. But what's happened has happened and how the fire was handled should renew confidence in our safety procedures,"" said the press officer.
One analyst at Natwest Securities said there should be little further impact on shares or consumer confidence.
Shares in cross-channel ferry operator P&amp;O were five pence higher at 602-1/2p.

6,"U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co dealt a blow to its Halewood plant in northwest England on Thursday, announcing 1,300 job cuts and apparently switching production of a new model to plants in Spain and Germany.
Just months after giving the factory its global quality award for 1996, Ford told workers and their union leaders the new version of its mid-range Escort model would not be built at Halewood near Liverpool, an unempolyment blackspot.
The proposed job cuts will reduce Halewood's workforce to just over 3,000, compared with a peak of 14,000 in the 1960s.
The workers believe the new model, due in 1999, will be built instead at Ford's plants in Valencia, Spain, and Saarlouis, Germany. Ford has not said where the new model will be built.
Angry trade unions, including the Transport and General Workers Union (TGW) and the AAEU, blamed the decision on what they see as a lack of legal protection for British workers.
Britain has opted out of European Union's Social Chapter, which sets out working conditions, making it ""cheaper to dump labour in the UK than on the continent,""one union boss said.
Ford attempted to soften the blow by saying Halewood could be the site to build a new vehicle, probably a multi-purpose people-carrier, but this remains at the concept stage. And Ford said that Halewood would continue to make the current Escort model through the year 2000.
""The actions we have announced today at Halewood assembly operations give the plant a realistic future, with an exciting new vehicle in the medium term, subject to approval and performance objectives being achieved,"" said David Gorman, European vehicle operations manager for Ford.
""We have had to take these steps to ensure our manned capacity is in line with our forecasts for sales,"" he said.
Industry analysts said the failure of the Escort rather than problems at the plant were largely behind this decision.
Ford of Europe is suffering mainly because people refuse to fall in love with the Escort-the small family car that competes with the Volkswagen Golf and Opel Astra, they said.
""People just didn't like the Escort. It was not as exciting as the competition, and Ford kept on having to revamp it,"" said Charles Young, director of Automotive Research at J.D.Power-LMC Automotive Forecasting.
Ford Europe lost $472 million in the third quarter of 1996, up from a loss of $320 million in the same 1995 period.
A Ford spokeswoman in Germany said the Halewood decision should be seen more in the context of Ford's continued over-capacity in Europe as a whole rather than in any purely national terms.
Halewood workers pledged to fight the proposals, with the TGW describing them as ""morally unacceptable"" and threatening nationwide action.
Union bosses said the Escort was a big seller in Britain and that some production should remain in the country.
The local community, the Speke area of Liverpool, already suffers unemployment of up to 39 percent and its crime rate has worsened as businesses have pulled out, residents said.
Landlord Mike Kelly of the Orient pub, the Ford workers' local, said, ""I don't think the government is interested in Liverpool.""
""I don't know how long this pub will be here now -- this place is becoming like a ghost town,"" he said.
Local residents complained that shops, banks and supermarkets have closed as businesses moved out of the area, and saw the problem getting worse with the Ford news.
Local Member of Parliament David Alton, an opposition Leberal Democract, told Reuters he had spoken to Ford, which said the jobs would be lost through voluntary redundancy.
""There's some good news in what they say as well -- that they're looking at Halewood as the probable European site for a planned new vehicle,"" Alton said.
""In Germany, if Ford closes its plant there, it has to pay its people 18 months pay in compensation. In the UK, we've got no Social Chapter, it's easier to shut us down,"" production line group leader Phil Gornall said.
Larry Brook of the MSF union added: ""Britain is the cheapest place to dump labour. We are fighting for the future of Halewood.""
Professor Garyl Rhys, a car industry expert at Cardiff University, said Halewood, now a model of industrial relations, was paying for the ""bad old days"" of the 1960s and 1970s, when the British car industry had a bad strike record.
""Because of the problems at Halewood and a number of other car plants in Britain, there was a reluctance to use them as sources for exports...You couldn't guarantee deliveries because of interruptions to production because of strikes,"" he said.
Ford cars were, however, the three biggest sellers in Britain in 1996, with the Escort ranked number two behind the smaller Fiesta and ahead of the Mondeo.

6,"Wickes Plc, the British Do-It-Yourself retailer hit by accounting irregularities that led to an overstating of profits, said on Wednesday its ex-chairman had accepted responsibility and the cost would be a 51 million pounds write-off.
The retailer said the problems had resulted in profits being overstated by 51 million pounds ($80.8 million) over recent years and that amount would be written off shareholder funds.
Restatement of the accounts will result in a reduction of 26 million pounds in operating profit for 1995, 14 million pounds for 1994 and 11 million pounds for earlier years.
Profits for 1995 will also be hit by a two million pounds charge against shareholder funds relating to European businesses and a 10 million pounds charge stemming from property interests.
In a letter to shareholders, new chairman Michael von Brentano said the group had recorded an operating loss for the nine months so far this year but pledged that its objective was a return to profits in 1997.
""A new business plan...will be finalised once the negotiations with suppliers are substantially complete. This provides for a substantial reduction in costs, improved marketing initiatives and efficient administrative procedures,"" he said.
Wickes also plans a refinancing involving a rights issue of new shares to restore its gearing to a ""more suitable level"". Group net debt averaged 65 million in the second half of the year.
Wickes said it would not seek a relisting of its shares, which were suspended in June, until the new rights shares were issued. A prospectus in connection with the issue was expected to be issued in December, with the new shares being issued following shareholder approval in early 1997.
""I appreciate that much of what I have written will be very disappointing to you,"" he said. ""But now my principal concern is to secure the company's future, define the appropriate cost base and reassert the group's market strengths.""
Von Brentano said his predecessor, Henry Sweetbaum, who resigned in June, had now accepted ""ultimate responsibility"" for overstating profits.
Sweetbaum will repay 1.2 million pounds in bonus payments, including tax, and former finance director Trefor Llewellyn has agreed to repay his 485,000 pounds bonus for 1995.
The group is seeking a new chief executive and said it also intended to strengthen non-executive representation on its board.
Disciplinary action has been taken against two Wickes directors with responsibility for the buying department, both of whom have resigned. Further action will be taken against other middle ranking executives and more junior employees.
The news ends months of waiting for shareholders which saw the shares in limbo at 69 pence after suspension, compared with a year high of 142.
The chairman said it was now important to look to the future and offered some good news, saying that sales in the Wickes stores had been up 8.9 percent on a comparable-store basis in the third quarter, recovering from a 9.7 percent slump seen in the first three months of the year. ($1=.6309 Pound)

6,"British defence and industrial giant General Electric Co Plc saw its half year profits hit by a restructuring charge on Friday to cover an internal shake-up which includes a string of disposals and up to 1,000 job cuts.
Half year pretax profits slumped to 261 million pounds ($423.6 million) from 402 million after the 160 million pounds charge. Underlying profit growth was meagre once again, rising 4.7 percent to 421 million pounds. The interim dividend payout was 3.26 pence versus 3.10 pence per share last year.
In the first set of results delivered since George Simpson took over as head of the group from veteran managing director Lord Weinstock, GEC said the 160 million charge was being levied ""for the restructuring of existing and acquired businesses"" as well as marking down assets in its industrial group before sale.
GEC's shares were slightly lower after the results, trading down four and a half pence at 361 pence in a tumbling market.
""All in all, the GEC results are a bit disappointing,"" one analyst who declined to be named said. ""The headline profits figure was just in line, the dividend increase wasn't very generous and the exceptional was unexpected.""
David Newlands, finance director, said there could be up to 1,000 jobs cut at the newly acquired AG Power Transmission and Distribution and Hazeltine Corp of the U.S.
The related redundancy and closure cost is expected to be 45 million pounds of the total 160 million charge revealed earlier. Another 50 million of that total relates to asset write-downs at two unnamed units earmaked for sale.
""We've had many offers for companies in the industrial group over the years -- all have been well above the book value, except for these two,"" said Newlands.
He said the move was necessary in order to dispose of the two divisions with a string of other divestments. The first sale is expected to take place before Christmas.
""We are trying to accelerate the disposal programme. But is takes two to tango,"" he added.
The rest of the charge announced in Friday's results relates to restructuring within remaining firms.
In a divisional breakdown of the results, chairman Lord Prior said electronic systems and defence reported progress, with margins and profits ahead.
""GEC Alsthom maintained sales and profits in line with expectations. Telecommunications, consumer goods, office equipment and printing, medical equipment, industrial apparatus and distribution and trading all contributed higher profits,"" said the chairman.
But the Gilbarco unit in the U.S. saw a profit fallback. Weak world demand for semiconductors also hit electronic components. Newlands said he did not expect that market to recover until the spring or summer of 1997.

6,"Crucial talks between the British and U.S. governments on clinching an open skies pact to free the transatlantic airline market were postponed for two weeks on Monday due to the illness of a senior British negotiator.
The talks had been due to kick off in Washington on Tuesday, with representatives from the British and U.S. governments as well as the main transatlantic carriers.
But a spokesman for the British government said: ""Our lead official is in hospital so the meeting has been cancelled. The talks have been postponed for a fortnight.""
News of the eleventh-hour grounding of talks came as the European Commission kicked off a separate series of private hearings in Brussels into the proposed British Airways and American Airlines alliance, which is conditional on an open skies pact being clinched.
British and U.S. carriers expressed regret that the Anglo-U.S. talks had been delayed. But sources reiterated that this round of talks had not been expected to deliver a final deal.
""It's not damaging. The two sides had been talking informally anyway and this round was never billed as the breakthrough round,"" one U.S. airline spokesman said. ""It was meant to deal with more boring issues like ground handling.""
The two sides are believed to have been inching closer, but Scott Yohe, senior vice-president of government affairs at Delta Air Lines Inc, told Reuters he believed full agreement was not possible in the current round. He said a deal is likely to emerge in subsequent talks.
But a number of other major hurdles need to be cleared. First the British government wants to try to link the open skies talks with the BA/AA alliance. The U.S. wants to keep the talks and alliance approval as two distinct issues.
Britain is still waiting for its competition watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, to give a final verdict on the alliance after receiving responses from the airline industry.
In particular, airlines are waiting for a clarification on how BA should divest itself of 168 landing slots at London's Heathrow airport -- a condition for the BA/AA deal to be cleared by the Office of Fair Trading.
""Buying/selling of slots is fundamental to any (open skies) deal,"" said one U.S. airline spokesman.
Whether BA can sell them or must give them away remains a grey area. Britain says the decision lies with the government, but the European Commission says it has final jurisdiction and claims that selling slots is banned under EU law.
Another issue within the open skies framework is the argument by the British government for some protection for smaller airlines taking the full brunt of competition under an open skies regime.
Britain is trying to secure a dispute reconciliation procedure. This is believed to be for the benefit of players like Virgin Atlantic, the transatlantic carrier owned by entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group.
Another complicating factor is the chance of a British election being announced in the coming weeks, which could put the talks on the backburner.
With the opposition Labour Party riding high in opinion polls, one industry insider said that if there was a change of government ""there is the possibility that Labour will want to start from scratch.""

6,"British building materials company Wolseley Plc reported a one percent slip in year pretax profits on Tuesday, but despite topping analysts' forecasts in a tough market shares slid on the poor outlook for mainland Europe.
Pretax profits for the year ended July 31 fell to 242.9 million pounds ($387 million) from 245.4 million. But sales rose to 4.31 billion from 3.78 billion pounds and the dividend was raised to 10.35 pence from 9.80 last year.
The fallback in profits had been flagged in a profit warning earlier this year.
But Wolseley survived the difficult conditions better than others partly thanks to its lower European exposure. The group has 50 percent of its sales in the U.S.
Chairman Richard Ireland reported organic sales growth across all three divisions blaming the lower profits on ""poor economic conditions in mainland Europe and volatile lumber prices in the U.S.""
""The results for 1996 should be set against the background of economic difficulties in France and Austria and a flat home (UK) market,"" he said.
But in an interview with Reuters chief financial controller Stephen Webster said ""I do not see an upturn in the next 12 months in France, Austria or Germany.""
He denied it would seriously dampen profits this coming year, explaining that conditions remain stable.
The UK market showed a glimmer of recovery, with spending on repair and maintenance of homes moving ahead.
But Webster said the housebuilding sector had seen companies using up existing stock so there has been little feed-through to companies like Wolseley. He predicted it would be spring before the industry felt the benefits.
The finance chief also expressed concern about the threat of an interest rate hike in the U.S. ""A half a percent would not be a big deal but one percent could damage confidence.""
The caution in all its markets was enough to push shares lower. By 1045 GMT they were down 13 pence at 494.
The new chief executive John Young did not signal any departure from the group's existing strategy.
But Webster signalled the possibility of some change ""We are keen to keep the good things. If anything it may mean a change of style. ""But there are no sacred cows in Wolseley. We will take difficult decisions if needed.""
Young said in the interim statement he wanted to look to expansion into new regions and products. With gearing at a low 7.7 percent, there is scope to raise it to around 30 percent if a big acquisition comes along, said Webster.

6,"Go-Ahead Group Plc, the UK transport company, and its French partner VIA-GTI are set to be announced as the preferred bidder for the Thameslink passenger rail franchise, industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.
An official announcement is expected from the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) imminently.
The joint venture, which is 65 percent owned by Go-Ahead and 35 percent by the VIA-GTI, is called GOVIA.  
Go-Ahead has already won the Thames rail franchise and GOVIA had been shortlisted for Thameslink, as well as ScotRail and Regional Railways North East.
The Thameslink rail franchise runs to Luton and Gatwick airports through the financial district of London and is seen as having great potential as a fast-link to these major UK airports.
Go-Ahead is a bus and rail operator. As well as becoming a player in the rail franchise market, it also has around eight percent of the UK bus market, with fleets running in London, Oxford and the north east of England.
The group has been among a number of UK bus companies to move into rail, fuelling growth in earnings, which has triggered a strong rise in its share price.

6,"Anglo-U.S. auto-components-to- aerospace giant LucasVarity, said on Tuesday it was sifting through some offers for the 13 companies earmarked for disposal under its post merger corporate shake-up.
Victor Rice, chief executive, told Reuters he expected the group to be in ""active negotiations"" on the sale of some of the non-core units quite soon. Only eight of the 13 businesses marked for sale were named in the restructuring statement released earlier. Rice said that major businesses like aerospace and electronics were not among the unnamed five.  
Rice refused to comment on how soon he expected the first disposals to go through.
The restructuring plans will be accelerated leading to the divestment of 13 business and 3,000 job cuts worldwide over two years.
Rice said the post-merger savings were ""virtually double"" original expectaions, with annual operating savings seen at 120 million stg by January 31 1999.
The criteria for divestment were those firms which ""neither fitted into the core strategy of the company or contributed economic added value.""
He said the process of raising cost efficiency continued and concluded that he was ""pretty excited for the future.""

6,"Tomkins Plc, the British baking-to-engineering combine, reported a sharp surge in half year profits on Monday but snuffed out hopes of a share buyback this year by flagging possible acquisitions instead.
Pretax profits for the six months to November 2 rose 34 percent to 168.8 million pounds ($284 million). The dividend rose to 3.06 pence from 2.7 pence the preceding year.
Executive chairman Gregory Hutchings said the results marked ""another period of outperformance for Tomkins"" and forecast the the shares should continue to outperform the sector.
Hutchings ruled out the possibility of returning the company's 366 million pound cash-pile to shareholders this year, saying in an interview: ""We see sufficient (acquisition) opportunities to hold onto our cash for the time being.""
Hutchings said the group was likely to make a number of smaller buys. ""It won't be one major deal, but it could be worth up to 200 million pounds,"" he said.
Rumours of a buyback in 1997 have helped push Tomkins shares ahead in recent weeks. Its shares on Monday reversed early gains, however, and were down four at 273-1/2p by 1115 GMT.
""The numbers were at the top end of what people were looking for and we've seen some early interest,"" one market-maker said. Analysts had expected profits of around 160 million pounds.
The outlook was also seen as promising.
""Prospects for the second half look encouraging, with the majority of our operations having healthy order books and satisfactory market conditions,"" Hutchings said.
He said Tomkins was delighted with its purchase last year of U.S. automotive and industrial product firm Gates Corp for $1.1 billion.
Gates contributed 259.5 million in sales and 20 million in profit in its first 14 weeks under Tomkins control.
A divisional breakdown of the Tompkins figures showed fluid controls had sales of 189.2 million versus 165.7 million pounds, with profits of 19 million versus 15.8 million.
Industry services saw sales rise to 219 million from 194 million, with profits of 12.5 million versus 12.1 million. Professional garden and leisure products saw sales of 276 million versus 271 million and profits down to 8.5 million from 8.9 million.
Industrial products sales rose to 317.3 million from 267.9 million, with profits of 34.3 million versus 28.5 million.
Milling and baking, which includes the Hovis bread brand, saw sales up to 351.3 million versus 333.8 million, with profits at 15.4 million versus 13.7 million.
Food products, including Bisto gravy and Robertson's jam range, saw sales up to 543.5 million from 501.8 million, with profits at 42.6 million versus 38.5 million.
Excluding currency effects, organic growth in group operating profit was up more than 10 percent on sales, which in turn rose by seven percent.
Unlike other major export groups, Tomkins has so far been left unscathed by the pound powering ahead against the dollar and mark.
Against the dollar, Tomkins said it was locked at $1.52 to the pound for the rest of the year. The amount of mark-denominated business was minimal, it said.
On market conditions, Tomkins said the U.S. was seen remaining firm. Britain was described as mixed, while the French market was expected to continue to suffer due to economic problems. ($1=.5950 Pound)

9,"Cisco Systems Inc. said Tuesday its fiscal first quarter profit from operations rose 77 percent, reflecting strong sales of its computer networking equipment.
The company, which makes devices that control the flow of information between computers in a network, said earnings before gains and charges rose to $320.8 million, or 47 cents a share, for the three months ended Oct. 26, from $181.4 million or 28 cents in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income for the quarter, after taking into account a $174.6 million charge for the acquisition of Telebit Corp. and a $55.1 million gain from the sale of a minority investment, totaled $180.9 million, or 26 cents a share, slightly lower than the year-ago figure.
Revenues jumped 80 percent to $1.43 billion from $798.3 million.
Wall Street had expected Cisco, the world's biggest computer networking company and a bellwhether technology stock, to report a profit from operations of 46 cents, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
Analysts said the company had a solid quarter, alleviating concerns in recent weeks about slowing sales of networking equipment.
""They surprised us on the revenue,"" said Eric Blachno, analyst at Bear Stearns in New York. ""It was a little higher than we thought.""
Cisco also managed to keep its gross margins -- a measure of how much profit a company makes from each dollar of sales -- at 65 percent, better than analysts had expected.
Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., attributed the higher profits to strong sales across all its product lines.
""More of our customers are beginning to look at a single vendor"" for all of their networking needs, said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive.
The company reported its results after the market closed. For the day, the stock had gained $1.125 to close at $61.75. After the earnings release, the shares slipped 25 cents to $61.50 in after-hour trading.
Analysts said some investors may have been disappointed that Cisco's earnings per share were not higher. Frequently, Cisco reports per-share results that are at least 3 or 4 cents above forecasts.

9,"Bay Networks Inc., keeping up with rivals in the computer networking business, said Wednesday it paid $99 million in cash and stock to buy closely held NetICs Inc.
The acquisition gives Bay Networks a line of devices called Fast Ethernet switches that are becoming increasingly popular with computer technicians for speeding up the flow of information through corporate computer networks.
Bay Networks' rivals Cisco Systems Inc. and 3Com Corp. have bought similar Fast Ethernet technology in recent months.
Bay Networks, based in Santa Clara, Calif., agreed to pay about $55 million in stock and $44 million in cash for NetICs, a company that has yet to report any revenue. Bay will charge ""a substantial portion"" of the purchase price against earnings for its quarter ending in December, the company said.
Bay Networks' stock was off 12.5 cents at $21.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The acquisition keeps Bay Networks up to date with rapidly emerging technology, said Dick Eyestone, its senior vice president. ""We live in dog years in this industry. Six months is like forever,"" he said.
Eyestone, who will oversee NetICs' operation as a Bay Networks unit, said his company plans to use NetICs' designs in its own line of networking products. Bay will release the first product from the acquisition in the first quarter.
NetICs, formed in 1995 by a dozen engineers, will remain in Acton, Mass. Until now, NetICs has been developing its technology and has not had any revenue, said Gary Vacon, NetICs founder and president.
Some analysts said they were surprised by the amount of money Bay was willing to pay to get its hands on the technology.
""I know companies with revenues in this sector that would be happy to get $30 million,"" said Steve Koffler, an analyst at NatWest Securities in New York. ""They obviously felt they need this technology.""
Bay Networks executives said they are paying the standard price for high-tech startups.
""This is right in line with the industry standard and our expectations,"" said Bill Ruehle, Bay Networks chief financial officer. He declined to say how much revenue he expects NetICs products to generate.

9,"Apple Computer Inc. Chairman Gilbert Amelio said Tuesday the computer maker's three-year turnaround plan was still on track despite its statement last week that it will report a first-quarter operating loss of as much as $150 million.
Amelio, speaking to thousands of Macintosh computer enthusiasts at the MacWorld trade show here also called on several star computer industry executives to express their support for the Macintosh.
In his much-anticipated keynote speech, Amelio assured Mac customers the company will have a smooth transition as Apple shores up its finances and overhauls the fundamental software of the Macintosh.
""We will encounter a few bumps on the way, but I don't want that to shake your confidence,"" Amelio told Macintosh customers and software developers. ""We are sticking to our strategy.""
Apple has been struggling for the past year to stop huge financial losses, develop new software to make the Mac more modern and increase revenues. Under Apple's three year plan, it aims to stop financial losses in 1996, develop new products in 1997 and increase revenues in 1998.
Since Amelio became chairman of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company a year ago, he has slashed costs. In December, Apple also agreed to buy NeXT Software Inc. for $400 million to get its help in revamping the fundamental software of the Mac.
In order to move developers smoothly from Apple's current operating system to the new system, Apple said it plans to continue to deliver regularly scheduled upgrades to the current system while accelerating development of a new and advanced operating system.
The new operating system, code-named ""Rhapsody,"" will be based on the merging of technologies from Apple and NeXT.
""Our goal is to be one of the world's strongest brands for consumer, education and the enterprise,"" Apple co-founder and Next Software President Steven Jobs said, adding Apple hoped to rely on Next's multimedia and computing intensive software to accomplish that goal.
Apple said Friday it expected to report a loss from operations of $100 million to $150 million because of weak sales of its Performa line of Macintosh computers. Revenue for the company's first quarter ended Dec. 27 is expected to drop 10 percent from the $2.3 billion reported in the September quarter.
Amelio blamed the shortfall on weak consumer sales for personal computers rather than a breakdown of Apple's strategy.
""We had one thing that really fell out of bed in a big way and that is, Santa Claus forgot to come,"" he said, referring to the surprisingly low sales of its Performa desktop PC line aimed at consumers.
The first quarter ""was about retail sales, not about the fundamentals in the recovery of Apple,"" Amelio told a packed ballroom.
Industry experts say part of the blame for declining revenue falls on the perception that there is not as much software for the Macintosh as there is for PCs running Windows software from Microsoft Corp..
To boost the Mac's image, Amelio turned to executives from Microsoft, Sun Microsystems Inc., and Netscape Communications Corp. to announce software plans for future versions of the Mac.
""We see great opportunities for the Mac in the future,"" said Paul Maritz, Microsoft vice president in charge of application development.
At Macworld, Microsoft introduced its Internet Explorer browser for the Mac.
The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant, which has often battled Apple for control of the PC industry, also said it created a new product unit responsible for design and development of a Macintosh version of its widely used Microsoft Office software suite.
While Microsoft remains Apple's great nemesis in the operating systems software business, Microsoft also has long served as the leading independent developer of software applications that run on Apple Macintosh computers.
""When Apple's biggest third-party developer decides to commit new resources to its Macintosh applications business, that's a pretty clear sign that there's still money to be made in the Macintosh market,"" said Jeffrey Tarter, an industry analyst and publisher of Soft*Letter.
The creation of the new Macintosh product unit, part of the Microsoft desktop applications division, marks the first time in the history of the division that an entire product unit has focused exclusively on the Macintosh, Microsoft said.
James Barksdale, chief executives of Internet software vendor Netscape, also said his company will release versions of its communication software within the next few weeks that will run on Apple's next-generation operating system.
Apple's stock closed down 37.5 cents at $17.50 on Nasdaq.

9,"Most U.S. software publishers are expected to report only modest increases in their third-quarter earnings, reflecting a seasonal slowdown and a lack of new products this quarter.
""For the behemoths of the industry, like Microsoft (Corp) and Oracle (Corp ), business is still good,"" said Marshall Senk, an analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co in San Francisco. ""Summer is the slow buying season for most of the industry,"" but setting aside the seasonal slowing, ""business is still pretty okay.""  
Analysts expect Microsoft, the world's biggest personal computer software publisher, to report substantially higher earnings for its first quarter of fiscal 1997 on the back of strong sales of its networking software and business programs. Microsoft is scheduled to report results on Oct. 21.
Better-than-expected sales of personal computers in the past few months also will contribute to Microsoft's revenue, analysts said. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., makes about a quarter of its revenue from the sale of its Windows family of operating systems.  Operating systems are the type of software that controls the basic functions of every PC.  
Microsoft benefits from strong PC sales because PC makers have to pay Microsoft a royalty for every copy of Windows they pack in the boxes of new machines.
Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $0.90 a share, according to a survey of 24 analysts by First Call.  In the same quarter a year ago, Microsoft earned $0.78.
Novell Inc, the biggest publisher of computer networking software, is not expected to perform as well.  
The company is struggling to sell its NetWare flagship -- which controls the flow of computer information through departmental computer departments -- in the face of competition with Microsoft's Windows.  Novell, based in Provo, Utah, also still faces management issues following the resignation of Bob Frankenberg, the former chief executive officer, said David Takata, an analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co in Los Angeles.
""They clearly still have a lot of work to do"" to get the company's management in order, Takata said.  
Novell is expected to earn $0.18 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with $0.16 a year ago, according to a First Call survey of 17 analysts.
Meanwhile, vendors of software for large, corporate computer networks and database management tools are expected to continue to post substantial gains in the third quarter on continuing strong demand.
""For a relatively mature market, this niche is still growing at a good clip,"" said Jim Pickrel, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco.  
Pickrel said he expects Oracle and Informix Corp to report the most impressive results on strong sales of their database software -- computer programs which help big companies keep track of huge libraries of corporate information.  Both are taking business from Sybase Inc,  another database software publisher, which is still struggling to recover from marketing and technical shortcomings last year.
Sybase,is expected to report it broke even in the quarter, not counting charges for a restructuring, Pickrel said.  In the year-earlier quarter, Sybase earned $0.01 a share.  
Oracle, the biggest database software publisher, is expected to earn $0.27 a share for the fiscal second quarter ending November, according to a recent survey of 27 analysts by First Call.  A year ago in the same quarter, it earned $0.21.
Hambrecht &amp; Quist's Pickrel said Informix could pass Sybase this quarter in revenue to become the second biggest database vendor.  Informix is expected to earn $0.18 a share, according to a First Call survey of 25 analysts.  In the same quarter a year ago, Informix earned $0.16.
"
9,"Informix Corp. shares plunged to a three-year low Tuesday after the database software company said it expected to report a ""substantial"" first-quarter loss on far weaker-than-expected sales.
Informix said it expected to report revenue of $130 million to $145 million, about 30 percent less than the $204 million reported in the same quarter a year ago and far less than Wall Street expected.
Shares of Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., fell $5.125 to $10 in mid-afternoon trading of 22 million shares, making the stock the second-most active on the Nasdaq. Earlier, the shares traded as low as $8.75.
The company blamed weak sales on an ""over-emphasis"" of marketing on a new, jazzy version of its flagship database software product, at the expense of neglecting its proven line of existing products.
""We were literally enamoured with our technology lead and we took our eyes off the core business,"" said Phil White, Informix chief executive, in a conference call with investors.
Informix writes computer programmes, called databases, that let big companies store and retrieve huge amounts of vital information, such as customer names and inventory lists.
In December, Informix introduced Universal Server, a database that can not only store text and numbers like a traditional database, but also video, sound, photographs, maps and other non-traditional types of data.
Informix executives last year bet that there would be huge demand for a database that could store media, as companies rushed to set up elaborate sites on the World Wide Web. They also expected existing customers to upgrade quickly to the new database.
Things will take much longer than Informix planned, analysts said.
""Universal Server is cool technology, but people don't go out to buy technology,"" said David Rothschild, managing director of brokerage Piper Jaffrey in Minneapolis. They buy proven products to help them manage vital records, he said.
""It's a classic product transition,"" said Charles Phillips, software analyst at investment bank Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. ""They're trying to sell a new product before it's ready to be sold and they're not concentrating on the old product.""
Also, Informix seems to be losing ground to Oracle Corp., the biggest vendor of database software.
Oracle, too, is pitching a new generation of database software. Some customers may be waiting to check out Oracle's updated database product -- dubbed Oracle8 and scheduled to be released in June -- before buying from Informix, analysts said.
"
9,"Apple Computer Inc.'s unexpected fourth quarter profit initially impressed Wall Street, but some analysts said Thursday that the computer maker was not out of the woods yet.
Apple on Wednesday reported a profit of $25 million for its fiscal fourth quarter, defying Wall Street's expectations for a loss. But analysts said that a steeper-than-expected 23 percent drop in revenue in the quarter could hurt the computer maker's prospects in the new fiscal year.
The analysts said sluggish revenues could force Apple to skimp on research and development spending just as rivals Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. are preparing innovative software for personal computers that could permanently squelch Apple's technology and ease-of-use bragging rights.
""Apple's never hit a wall like this before,"" said Kurt King, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ""They've never seen their sales drop this much before. It's possible they can recover, but unlikely.""
Analysts attributed Apple's profit, equal to 20 cents a share, to aggressive cost cutting, lower prices for memory chips, as well as a one-time gain of $17 million. In the 1995 quarter, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company earned $60 million, or 48 cents a share.
Revenues fell to $2.32 billion from $3 billion.
While Apple's machines remain popular in education and publishing, the company has lost many customers to Compaq, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other competitors.
The man hired in February to revive the company, Gilbert Amelio, the former head of National Semiconductor Corp., has cut costs aggressively but has not found a way to boost sales.
In the crucial December quarter, revenues will be about even with the $2.32 billion reported for the September quarter, Apple executives said.
The prospect of flat sales during the Christmas season, typically the year's busiest, could finally convince loyal developers of educational and consumer software to defect, further loosening Apple's hold on those markets, analysts said.
""I can't remember the last time Apple's revenue declined in the December quarter from the September quarter,"" said Jim Poyner at Oppenheimer in New York. ""Christmas is supposed to be Apple's high-water mark. This isn't a good sign.""
The cautious comments were reflected in Apple's stock, which retreated after an early-morning surge to close at $26.375, up 62.5 cents, on Nasdaq. Earlier, the stock was as high as $27.75.
Apple, which lost about $800 million in the three prior quarters, has been slow to introduce new products.
It is not expected to release a new line of low-cost Macintosh machines aimed at consumers until next year, and it has been slow to replace a glitch-prone line of PowerBook portable computers. A new PowerBook line is expected to be unveiled on Monday, analysts said.
In a conference call with reporters and analysts, Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said PowerBook sales were expected to fall $150 million in the current quarter, adding to pressure on revenues.
Anderson also said the company's research and development budget would probably be flat next year.
But the $600 million or so that Apple spent in fiscal 1996 will not keep up with Microsoft and Intel, which are each pouring billions of dollars into improving the multimedia and Internet capabilities of personal computers, analysts said.
""Where are Apple's innovations going to come from?"" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum at market researcher International Data Corp. ""They've got to come up with something new, something from the ground up.""
In the first half of calendar 1996, Apple's share of the domestic computer market fell to 6.7 percent from 9.9 percent in the 1995 period, Zwetchkenbaum said. The rest of the PC market is expected to grow 20 percent this year.
""Apple was the only vendor of the top ten PC makers to fall in shipments this year,"" Zwetchkenbaum said.
"
9,"Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday said it plans to release an operating system that will work on personal computers based on chips from Intel Corp. as well as on Apple computers.
At its annual developer conference, the company also said it will release programming tools in the next few months that will allow companies to write software for Apple computers once and automatically convert their products to run on PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Corp. Windows software.
The radical strategy is part of Apple's plan to keep software companies from abandoning Apple products, Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio told a crowd of 1,900 programmers here.
""For those of you who seek substantial business on both the Mac and Windows platforms, this new development environment holds tremendous promise,"" Amelio said. ""You can (write your applications once) and with a simple recompilation release them for both platforms.""
Until now, Apple has released operating system software that only runs on Apple-designed hardware.
Amelio said Apple's next-generation operating system, code-named Rhapsody, will not only run on Apple-designed computers, but also on PCs based on Intel chips and using Microsoft Windows software.
For the past two years, Apple has been scrambling to come up with improvements to the Macintosh that would set it apart from PCs. Until 1995, Apple had relied on its computers' famed ease-of-use as a selling point, but Microsoft's release of Windows 95 took away much of the impact of Apple's pitch.
Last year, Apple gave up on a mired effort to revamp the Macintosh Operating System, the fundamental programme that gives the Mac its look. In December, the company bought Next Software Inc. to get its software overhaul going again, and to use its software as the foundation of a next-generation operating system.
The move concerned lots of programmers, though, because of fears that the new operating system would not run the products they designed for the older Mac operating system. Programmers also were not thrilled to develop products for yet another operating system.
Apple plans to spend the rest of this week convincing programmers that it is a worthwhile investment to write software for Rhapsody.
Programmes written for Rhapsody will be able to run on old Macs, a new class of Apple machines using the Rhapsody operating system, and PCs running the Windows operating system, Amelio promised.
Investors, however, evidently decided to wait a while before rendering judgment, and Apple's stock ended unchanged at $17.5625 on Nasdaq.

9,"3Com Corp. stock lost more than a quarter of its value Monday after the computer networking equipment maker said its fiscal third-quarter earnings will be less than Wall Street had expected.
3Com, the nation's second largest networking vendor, also had to respond to rising competition from PC component powerhouse Intel Corp. by sharply cutting prices of its so-called ethernet network products, from which it derives 43 percent of its revenue.
The move fuelled even more concern among investors about 3Com's earnings outlook in coming quarters, and some analysts said they expect a further drop in technology stocks.
Stock in 3Com, based in Santa Clara, Calif., fell $13.50 to $37.25 in Nasdaq trading of more than 36 million shares, making the stock the most active in U.S. markets.
""This goes beyond just the third quarter for 3Com,"" said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at brokerage Furman Selz.
""I think it's going to spread from here,"" said David Takata, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co. ""The networking sector has been the leader in technology for three years.""
3Com said for the quarter ending Feb. 28 it will report earnings per share in a range from the mid-40s to low 50 cents a share. Wall Street expected 3Com to earn 60 cents per share, according to a recent survey by First Call, which tracks analyst estimates. A year earlier, 3Com earned 42 cents a share, or $74.6 million.
3Com said third-quarter revenues will reach $770 million to $810 million, missing analyst forecasts by at least $20 million.
3Com makes electronic devices that shuffle information between PCs operating in a network. The company gets about 43 percent of its revenue from ethernet adapter cards: graham cracker-sized devices that plug into PCs to link them with networks.
Last week, Intel, the world's biggest maker of PC components, cut prices of its line of fast ethernet cards sharply. The reduction forced 3Com to announce its own sharp price cuts Monday, fuelling concern about the company's revenue in coming quarters.
""Intel rocked 3Com off its solid foundation,"" said Carl Howe, senior analyst at market researcher Forrester Research Inc. ""They hit 3Com's cash cow.""
In the next few years, Intel potentially could incorporate networking functions into its computer chips, eliminating the need for seperate networking products, analysts said. Meanwhile, Intel will use its huge manufacturing facilities and its cost benefit to undercut 3Com in ethernet prices, analysts said.
Pyykkonen said Intel could elbow aside networking suppliers, just as it knocked down suppliers of sound and video components by making multimedia functions a built-in feature of its microprocessors.
""There's no reason why networking can't go the way of PCs,"" Pyykkonen said.
3Com's shortfall projection prompted several Wall Street analysts to slash their ratings on 3Com stock to hold or neutral.
""The tone of 3Com's business remains weak,"" said William Rabin, analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., who cut 3Com to ""market performer"" from ""buy.""
3Com's earnings forecast also raised concerns about the entire networking industry, whose revenue has been growing about 35 percent annually. 3Com's woes are a sign that industry growth is finally slowing.
""Everyone is not only more on edge about 3Com's numbers but also whether they need to change the revenue picture in the longer term.""
The drop in 3Com prompted declines in stocks in other network stocks, as well as makers of personal computers, computer chips and software.
Another major network equipment company, Cisco Systems Inc. saw its stock drop $5.125 to $58 on Nasdaq. Ascend Communications Inc., another closely watched networking stock, fell $4.625 to $62.625, also on Nasdaq. Bay Networks Inc. fell 87.5 cents to $18.625, and Cabletron Systems Inc. fell $1.875 to $29, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
Intel also dropped, losing $4.75 to $151.625 on Nasdaq.

9,"Microsoft Corp. Monday will unveil a set of software technologies that lets programmers more easily create software for sharing information through corporate and public computer networks.
Microsoft executives, including Chairman Bill Gates, also will discuss at an event in Los Angeles development plans for the company's Windows family of operating systems, the company said Friday.
At one of its periodic Professional Developers Conferences, Microsoft executives will encourage programmers to write commercial software based on Microsoft's standards.
Microsoft's event will be held the same week Oracle Corp., Microsoft's biggest rival in the corporate software business, is holding a conference in San Francisco to pitch its own approach to writing programmes for shuffling information through huge networks.
Both companies in recent months have been retooling their key applications and networking software to work on the Internet's World Wide Web and internal corporate networks called intranets.
Writing even simple programmes to let computer users collaborate on documents through networks tradionally has required intimate knowledge of difficult programming techniques.
The technology Microsoft will unveil on Monday will relieve programmers of the need to know the secret handshakes of its Windows operating systems, said Tanya van Dam, a Microsoft group product manager.
The move would encourage developers to base more of their commercial products on Microsoft's Windows NT networking operating system, analysts said.
Oracle has a similar aim.
On Monday, the company will unveil its own tools for writing intranet software for tapping information stored in Oracle databases, Oracle executives said.
Corporate programmers have written huge libraries of financial, manufacturing and human resources software using Oracle's products. The new programming tools would let programmers easily convert the libraries to work on the Web, Oracle said.

9,"The stock of Apple Computer Inc. rose in heavy trading Thursday on a report that the chairman of software company Oracle Corp. said once again he was interested in buying the troubled computer maker.
Larry Ellison, Oracle chairman, told the San Jose Mercury News Wednesday that he was forming an investor group to raise $1 billion to buy a majority stake in Apple.
Ellison, a flamboyant software billionaire, has said since April 1995 that he would like to buy Apple with his own money, partly to prevent Microsoft Corp. from dominating the computer industry.
Based on its stock price, Apple is worth $2.17 billion. Ellison's stake in Oracle is worth about $6 billion.
Apple rose $2.25 to $19, while Oracle fell $1.125 to $39.375 on Nasdaq, where both stocks were among the most active issues in late trading.
Ellison told the newspaper he was publicly reasserting his interest in buying Apple partly to gauge investor support in the next few days. Based on the reaction, he will decide soon whether to make a bid.
Previously, he has said he approached unidentified big investors about a joint bid. He also has mulled the idea with his friend Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who was kicked out of the company in 1985 and returned in December as a part-time advisor to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio.
Ellison could not be reached for comment. Katie Cotton, Apple spokeswoman, said the Cupertino, Calif.-based company had no comments about Ellison.
Wall Street analysts said they doubted Ellison actually would attempt to buy Apple because he has not taken any concrete steps in the two years that he has expressed an interest.
""The deal doesn't make sense for (any outside investor) to take him up on it,"" said David Wu, analyst at investment bank ABN Ambro Chicago Corp.
Still, Ellison's comments should not be dismissed, some analysts said.
""It would be a mistake to analyse this as a pure business issue, as there is substantial ego involved,"" said Paul Saffo, a tracker of Apple and Ellison and a research fellow at Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley think tank.
Ellison, the third-richest software tycoon behind Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen, is intent on slowing Microsoft's dominance of the software industry, he has said in recent interviews. Apple, with its huge following of Macintosh fans, could be a key weapon.
Saffo also said Jobs, since returning to Apple late last year, has been very influential in trimming the company, and could be ""sprucing up"" Apple for an acquisition.
Jobs recently became a member of the Apple board following Apple's $400 million acquisition of his Next Software Inc.
Apple has suffered declining market share for its famous brand of easy-to-use computers and endured several rounds of restructuring in recent years. The stock has languished in the mid-teens since early January and is at a 10-year low.
In mid-March, the company said it planned to discontinue several product lines and lay off 4,000 employees, or one-third of its staff, in its latest bid to slash costs and turn the company around.

20,"The decision by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd to buy three more Airbus Industrie A340 long range aircraft will increase the airline's air cargo opportunities, according to a senior Cathay cargo executive.
Ray Jewell, cargo marketing and sales manager for Cathay Pacific Cargo, told Reuters in an interview that the new aircraft will be able to fly between 15 and 17 tonnes of belly space cargo plus passengers in normal weather conditions from Hong Kong to Toronto.
Other possible destinations for the new aircraft from Hong Kong to Europe are still being studied, he added. The A340's ability to fly ultra-long distances will mean some existing routes become non stop destinations, Jewell said.
""These new aircraft will certainly help us on the air cargo side of things, there is no question about that. We are very pleased with our existing A340s which are very cargo friendly and fuel-efficient along with our Boeing 777s,"" Jewell said.
Cathay currently have four A340-200 and three A340-300 in its fleet.
The new Airbus A340-300 models are due to be delivered in the second and third quarters of 1998 to coincide with the opening of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok and increased flight schedules.
""Chek Lap Kok will definitely open things up for us and for other airlines which at the moment are restricted for slots at Kai Tak. The new airport is a major factor in planning and strategy. The increased cargo opportunities go hand in hand,"" Jewell added.

20,"Lufthansa Cargo said there is good demand for air freight services between Germany and China because mainland companies are rushing to beat a year end deadline for import tax changes, the airline's managing director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Christian Sedelmaier has told Reuters.
In an interview, he said many joint venture companies are rushing to import machinery because it is tax exempt until the end of December. Leading German companies such as Volkswagen and Siemens are importing large amounts of industrial machinery into China via Lufthansa Cargo, Sedelmaier said.
""Because of the change, there is a rush for additional transportation requirements on our flights to China. Capacity until the end of the year is insufficient to meet demand. Companies have now missed the deadline to send machinery by sea so we are benefitting by that and also trying to arrange charter flights if possible,"" Sedelmaier said.
He also said demand for air freight in general in China will continue to grow with the 'just in time' concept becoming increasingly widespread in China.
Lufthansa Cargo said it currently offers one dedicated freighter service a week between Frankfurt, Beijing and Shanghai. It also offers additional cargo capacity on daily Lufthansa passenger flights and on five flights per week in a cooperation agreement with Air China. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

20,"The Hong Kong government said it is focusing on negotiating new overflight arrangements with several countries in time for the 1997 handover to China.
Up to now, Hong Kong has come under Britain's traffic rights umbrella. Now it must negotiate its own agreements so airlines can continue to fly over countries on key air routes, the government said.
A spokesman said the countries involved are located on routes from Hong Kong to Europe and to Africa, which are not signatories to International Air Services Transit Agreements with.
He declined to name them or say which negotiations were the most important as overflight fees will also be discussed and more pressure could be brought to bear on Hong Kong's negotiators.
Industry observers said the government is up against the clock to sign the new agreements before next year's handover.
""Some countries will be no problem, others may be sticklers,"" said a source close to the negotiating procedure.
Any proposed deal must be approved by the Joint Liaison Group, the Sino-British body set up to oversee the transition to Chinese rule. The text of a model overflight agreement to be used as the basis for the negotiations was cleared by the JLG in September.
Michael Arnold, who will be Hong Kong's chief negotiator, told Reuters that the negotiations will start as soon as possible with airlines fully involved. He said the agreements which are a form of international treaty will give greater certainty of routes.
""On flights to Europe, for example, given weather and the sometimes unstable political situation in some countries, the airlines need to have access to alternative routes. We need overflight agreements with a number of countries in order to offer several route options,"" he said.
He said overflight rights are now a priority following the successful completion of Hong Kong's final Air Service Agreement (ASA) with the Philippines last week.
""The number one task was to negotiate full ASAs to separate Hong Kong's air services from those previously provided for under the UK ASAs. This we have completed with the initialling of the Philippines agreement. We can now turn to focus on negotiating overflights,"" Arnold said.
When asked about overflight costs and whether airlines faced an increase Arnold said: ""We would hope to continue the present arrangements, obtained under the UK umbrella."" -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017

20,"Lauda Air is enjoying ""huge passenger growth"" on the Hong Kong to Vienna route but cargo is disappointing, the airline's Hong Kong general manager Sunny Yu told Reuters.
While there's been a 34 percent increase in the number of passengers along with a 42 percent growth in revenue over the past year, cargo revenue is up to three per cent below last year's level, he said. Lauda's Boeing 767-300 twice weekly flight from Hong Kong to Vienna via Bangkok averages eight to nine tonnes of belly cargo with watches a particularly common commodity, Yu said.
""Cargo is staying at more or less the same level as it was last year. A small price war and overcapacity with ad hoc charters operating into Hong Kong are major obstacles. I'm not optimistic about getting cargo rates back to the good old days,"" Yu said.
He said the cargo situation is not mirrored on the passenger side where Lauda expects another double digit rise in passenger numbers this year. The current number of passengers flying between Hong Kong and Vienna is around 9,000, Lauda says.
The Austria carrier also said it's being constricted in adding more frequencies to Hong Kong from its Vienna hub because of slot restrictions at Kai Tak airport but hopes to eventually benefit when the territory's new, round the clock airport opens in 18 months time. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017.

20,"British Airways World Cargo raised ex-Hong Kong market rates by HK$1.50 per kilo from January one to compensate for higher fuel prices, BA's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan said.
BA was the only airline not to get involved in the controversy over a fuel surcharge late last year, he added. Then when freight forwarders' complained over fuel surcharges, most carriers operating European services raised ex-Hong Kong market rates on January 1 by HK$1 a kilo instead.
However, when asked in the second week of January if BA would also be raising rates in line with its competitors, a senior BA official in Hong Kong had said the airline would ""wait and see.""
Chan said BA's HK$1.50 market rate rise was imposed on January 1 and followed a 50 HK cents rise on November 1 because of rising fuel prices.
Customer resistance to any price rise was ""inevitable"" but customers were realising how hard fuel prices have hit airlines, he noted.
Chan said despite the increase, current demand was strong with BA's three times a week wet lease freighter service to London Gatwick operating at full capacity. -- Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

20,"Airbus Industrie is for the first time in Asia marketing cargo space aboard the world's largest civil transporter, the consortium's press relations manager in China, David Velupillai, told Reuters.
Speaking at China's first airshow being held here, he said the Airbus A300-600 Super Transporter fleet has 800 hours a year available for wet lease. Known as the Beluga because of its giant, whale like appearance and cavernous 7.4 metre high jaw-like door, it is one of the world's most unusual aircraft which Airbus said can carry more voluminous freight than any other.
The first two of an eventual fleet of four aircraft are being used to transport large sections of fuselage and the wings for the Airbus family which are made near Chester, England and are flown to Toulouse for assembly. Other fuselage sections weighing up to 45 tons and 30 metres long are transported from Spain and Germany.
When the aircraft are not busy doing that, Airbus says it hope it can profit from wet leases of other outsize cargoes such as helicopters, aircraft engines and space satellites in which field China is a key world player with its Long March launcher.
""No other aircraft in the world can carry such large and unusual loads. The thing about satellites is they need to be transported whole and cannot be broken down for transport. It is a niche market but one we think there are opportunities in,"" Velupillai said.
Airbus said its large transporter has already been used to carry a satellite module which will form part of space station Alpha from Turin in Italy to Toulouse . Other projects include ferrying aviator Richard Branson's balloon to Morocco for his aborted round the world attempt.
The Beluga made its air show debut at Paris last year but is not being exhibited in China.
The twin engined purpose-built jets replace veteran four propellor engined Super Guppy aircraft which Airbus said are destined to become museum pieces. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

20,"Cathay Pacific Airways Limited is the first airline to test fly a new 'sharks skin' aircraft coating which could reduce fuel costs and revolutionise air travel, a Cathay spokeswoman told Reuters.
One of Cathay's four Airbus A340-300 aircraft has been partly covered by transparent, plastic adhesive foils containing fine ridges or riblets which resemble the texture of sharks' skin.
The spokeswoman said scientists discovered that sharks swim faster because their skin is covered in fine ridges running lengthwise along their bodies which reduces drag.
She said Airbus Industrie hope the streamlining principle can be transferred to aircraft, reducing the amount of fuel burned by up to one percent.
Over an aircraft's lifetime, the fuel bill saving could be huge at a time when rising fuel prices are a highly topical subject.
Airbus said it has already been conducting trials for several years with the U.S. manufacturer 3M but Cathay is the first scheduled airline to apply the latest technology, higher durability film.
Cathay passengers flying on long haul routes to Rome, Zurich, Toronto and Melbourne will not notice unless they look very closely at the fuselage and the differing destinations will offer a testing environment for the coating, the spokeswoman added.
""It is a very interesting development for Cathay to be involved in and anything that helps to cut the cost of fuel will be extremely welcome to us and the whole industry,"" the spokeswoman said.
She said the experiment is expected to last between one and five years with Airbus and 3M engineers visiting the aircraft for regular checks. Cathay's Flight Planning and Performance Department engineers will also be monitoring its performance, she said.

33,"Shares in British media and leisure firm Pearson Plc recovered on Wednesday following a trading statement which calmed market jitters about the outlook for the company.
Pearson had dipped to a two-month low on Tuesday but bounced back after the company said trading in the second half of the current year was in line with the first half. The shares were 20 1/2p firmer at 710p by 095 GMT.
Analysts said there was relief that Pearson, which passes into the hands of new chief executive Marjorie Scardino in January, had not produced any really nasty surprises.
""All in all, it's in line with expectations but that in itself is good as the last few trading updates from the company have been disappointing,"" said Anthony de Larrinaga of brokers Panmure Gordon.
Pearson said that total video retuning costs associated with the launch of the Channel 5 terrestrial television channel next March would rise to around 150 million pounds ($250 million).
This is almost treble the sum initially earmarked for dealing with video recorders affected by interference from the new channel's signal. But it is below the figure quoted in some recent media reports.
Channel 5 has recently been awarded an extra frequency to boost its coverage to 80 percent of the country and Pearson said its business plan showed significantly higher rates of return than in the original bid.
Pearson said the retuning costs and a major film deal with Fox would come out of the 300 million pound ($500 million) original funding agreed by the Channel 5 shareholders. The other shareholders are Britain's United News &amp; Media, U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus and Luxembourg broadcast group CLT.
This year's losses from Mindscape, Pearson's ailing U.S. consumer software unit, should be in line with earlier forecasts of around 46 million pounds. Pearson also saw no real impact on its 1996 profits from the current strength of sterling.
Pearson's interests range from the Financial Times newspaper, through to theme parks and television production.
The company's critics have long said it lacks focus and much attention is centred on the likely impact of Texan Scardino, the first woman to head one of Britain's leading companies.
""The key issue remains what the structure of Pearson will be. Which are the core areas and do all parts of the business fit?"" said de Larrinaga. ($1=.6003 Pound)
"
33,"Shares in Pearson Plc gained on Wednesday as new chief executive Marjorie Scardino officially took the reins at the diversified British media and leisure company.
Scardino, who becomes the first woman to head one of Britain's leading companies, has already said that Pearson's profit performance has been inadequate and disposals are expected as she aims for greater focus on core businesses.
Pearson shares added 8.5p to 738.5p on Wednesday, reflecting hopes that she will shake up what critics regard as a slumbering giant.
Scardino, a 49-year-old Texan, had been chief executive of The Economist Group, a magazine company half owned by Pearson. A Pearson spokeswoman said Scardino spent her first day ""meeting the troops"" at the company's central London headquarters.
She has already met her fellow executives and share analysts are hoping for some swift action to focus a company which is accused by critics of underexploiting a stellar group of assets.
Its businesses range from the Financial Times newspaper to Penguin books and a television production arm which makes low-budget programmes such as Australian soap ""Neighbours"".
Analysts identify Pearson's investment banking interests, its theme park businesses and loss-making U.S. software publishing company Mindscape as the obvious candidates for sale.
Pearson's Tussauds Group unit includes London's landmark Madame Tussaud's waxwork exhibition and theme parks such as Alton Towers in England and Spain's Port Aventura.
Pearson also has a 50 percent stake in London investment bank Lazard Brothers and smaller holdings in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York.
Analyst Jason Crisp of SocGen said he thought that Scardino would make quite rapid decisions on which businesses to keep and which to sell. But he added that any disposals would necessarily take time to complete.
Crisp said that SocGen remained positive about Pearson.
""It's not a storming buy but with a good team in place, I think the share price will tend to improve,"" he said.
Pearson effectively has a new management team following changes to the board last year.
The process will be complete when Dennis Stevenson replaces Michael Blakenham as chairman in May. Stevenson is currently deputy chairman.
Analyst Colin Tennant of UBS shared the view that investment banking, theme parks and Mindscape could be jettisoned.
But he said that the new management might find it difficult to drive the share price forward while selling off businesses.
""They have stressed they want focus but the problem is there is the possibility of earnings dilution on disposals,"" he said.
Tennant added that he thought Pearson shares ""pretty fully-valued"" at current levels.

33,"Shares in British commercial television (ITV) broadcaster Yorkshire-Tyne Tees slid on Tuesday despite an 80 percent rise in interim profit.
Pre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 rose to 13.3 million pounds ($20.76 million) from 7.4 million pounds in the same period a year ago. Interim dividend was increased to 6.8 pence from 3.7 pence.
The company said that the improvement had come despite a ""very disappointing"" advertising sales performance.
The northern English company, based in the city of Leeds, said that a smaller than expected increase in total ITV advertising revenues had been compounded by a slight decline in its share of that income.
The sales shortfall was, however, more than compensated by higher programme sales and the effects of cost controls.
Yorkshire shares had fallen 30p to 1210 by 1440 GMT. Bid speculation has helped them to power ahead in recent months from a 1996 low of 679p.
The decline was hastened after Yorkshire chairman and chief executive Ward Thomas said that he hoped British media and leisure company Granada would hold off from mounting an expected takeover bid.
Share analysts said that Yorkshire's comments on advertising and Granada had pushed the price lower in what was already a weak London market.
Granada, which already operates two ITV licences, has built a 24 percent stake in Yorkshire. It had been expected to follow through with a takeover bid following a relaxation in media ownership laws.
But Granada, which earlier this year acquired Britain's leading Forte hotel chain for 3.9 billion pounds, has recently given the impression of going cool on the bid.
Duncan Lewis, head of Granada's Media Division, was last month reported as saying Granada may look at other ITV targets.
Thomas dismissed the reported comments as a ""fairly puerile attempt to get the (Yorkshire) share price down"".
But he said any delay in a Granada bid would give Yorkshire time to rebuild its share of ITV advertising revenue and to make progress in its campaign for a reduction in its licence payments. These totalled 33 million pounds in the first half.
He suggested that full value for Yorkshire shares in any bid could be as high as 18 pounds. ($1=.6406 Pound)

33,"Britain's Ladbroke Group Plc and Hilton Hotels Corp (HHC) of the U.S on Monday agreed to reunite the Hilton brand worldwide in a deal which they said could be worth tens of millions of dollars annually.
The worldwide alliance signed on Monday covers 400 hotels in 49 countries and unifies the world-renowned brand for the first time since 1964.
HHC president Stephen Bollenbach said the two companies had explored every possible avenue in their talks but had concluded that a worldwide alliance provided the benefits they were seeking without the complications of a merger.
Ladbroke chief executive Peter George said the agreement should be worth ""tens of millions of dollars per annum"" to the two companies.
""Our people can really get on with the business of reuniting the two parts of Hilton,"" he told a news conference, describing Hilton as one of the world's great brand names.
HHC owns the Hilton name in the U.S. while Ladbroke holds the rights everywhere else through its Hilton International (HIC) subsidiary.
The Hilton hotel chain was founded in 1919 when Conrad Hilton opened his first hotel in the Texan town of Cisco. In 1946 Hilton became the first hotel company to list on the New York Stock Exchange.
HIC was spun off in 1964 and acquired three years later by Trans World Airlines. It was eventually bought by Ladbroke some 10 years ago.
The companies said that the deal covering sales and marketing, loyalty programmes and reservations would drive revenues and dispel the confusion that has surrounded the two groups in recent years.
As expected, the agreements provide for taking cross shareholdings of up to 20 percent. HHC said it intended to acquire a five percent stake in Ladbroke in due course.
George said that Ladbroke had no current plans to take a stake in HHC but would invest in HHC gaming projects.
He said that HHC could build its Ladbroke stake either through buying shares on the market or taking up new equity, or a combination of the two methods.
The two companies announced an outline agreement to unify the Hilton brand last August and share analysts said the announcement on Monday contained few surprises.
Ladbroke shares ended 1p lower at 232.5p but have appreciated some 10 percent since that August announcement.
Analyst Greg Feehely of Kleinwort Benson Securities said the deal could add 15 million pounds ($25 million) to Ladbroke's operating profit next year.

33,"United News &amp; Media on Tuesday emerged with the winning hand after a lengthy poker game over the future of international exhibitions group Blenheim.
United, which has interests in British national newspapers and commercial television, trumped its rivals with an agreed offer valuing Blenheim at 592.5 million pounds ($935 million).
The deal will create the world's largest trade exhibition group with a turnover of more than 500 million pounds based on 1995 figures.
Media and financial services group United said it had already secured acceptances for 51 percent of Blenheim after offering five pounds per share.
""The acquisition will be earnings-enhancing in the first full year but the real attraction is the long-term growth we can get out by combining these businesses into one group,"" United chief executive Clive Hollick told Reuters.
United News shares added 30 pence to 683-1/2 pence after the announcement, while Blenheim gained 23 to 496-1/2.
Dutch publisher VNU, which last week acquired a 15 percent stake in Blenheim, said it would not make a counter bid and was likely to sell its stake. That decision effectively removed the threat of a bidding war developing for Blenheim.
Anglo-Dutch media group Reed-Elsevier had been regarded as a rival suitor, but sources close to the company indicated in recent days that it had dropped out of the running.
French utilities group Compagnie Generale des Eaux confirmed on Tuesday that it planned to sell its 15 percent stake in Blenheim following United's offer.
The deal ends an on-off saga that began in June when Blenheim said it had received a bid approach. In August it said that talks with an unnamed party had broken down but then made another statement a few weeks later confirming a new approach.
Analysts said that Blenheim's geographical strength in continental Europe, and France in particular, made it a good fit with United.
""After VNU's move, United have done well to tie it up at five pounds a share,"" said David Forster of Salomon Brothers.
""In Miller Freeman, United have a substantial established business in this area and Blenheim will fit well into it.""
United's Miller Freeman subsidiary operates more than 100 exhibitions in the United States, Europe and Asia but the American market is seen as its main strength. These exhibitions are supported by a range of trade publications.
Blenheim operates more than 170 exhibitions worldwide but does not have a significant publishing portfolio.
""The directors of United believe that the Miller Freeman and Blenheim trade show portfolios are highly complementary geographically, by market sector, and in terms of operational management,"" United said in a statement.
The acquisition is the first major move by United since the national newspaper group merged with television and financial services group MAI earlier this year.
That merger doubled the size of the company, creating a British media major with a market capitalisation of more than three billion pounds. ($1=.6337 Pound)

33,"British pay television operator BSkyB said on Friday that it was considering further investment in Germany and would beam its second pay-per-view sports event into Britain later this month.
The satellite broadcaster said pre-tax profit had risen by 31 percent to 66 million pounds ($107.5 million) in the three months to September 30.
The company, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, said that total paying subscribers had reached 5.65 million at 30 September, a net increase for the quarter of 146,000.
""The company has performed strongly in the first quarter and has achieved significant growth in both revenue and profits,"" said BSkyB chief executive Sam Chisholm.
""Our increased investment in all areas of programming and the quality and choice we offer our subscribers will maintain our impetus,"" he added.
Operating revenues for the three months to September 30 increased to 266 million pounds, a rise of 24 percent on a year earlier. Earnings per share were 3.9 pence, 30 percent up.
BSkyB shares rose 4p to 582-1/2p although analysts said the subscriber growth figures were ""unexciting"" and the profits in line with expectations.
BSkyB said in July that it would take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1, the German digital television venture launched by Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch. BSkyB said on Friday it was considering investments in additional German Pay TV channels.
DF1 has made a slow start but the German pay television market is expected to expand rapidly in coming years.
BSkyB said it would show its second pay-per-view event on November 9 when Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield meet in Las Vegas for the WBA heavyweight boxing crown.
BSkyB successfully experimented with pay-per-view when Tyson fought Briton Frank Bruno in March. More than 600,000 homes paid some 10 pounds to see that fight.
BSkyB has said it plans to introduce digital satellite broadcasting into Britain late next year. Pay-per-view sports events and movies are likely to be one of the prime sources of income from the extra channels provided by digital.
Niche channels Sky Scottish and The Computer Channel were launched on Friday, bringing the total number of channels available on Sky Television to over forty.
However, Friday's planned launch of WBTV-The Warner Channel was postponed at the 11th hour on Thursday evening.
The Warner Channel -- a mixture of Bugs Bunny cartoons and vintage movies -- was apparently a victim of the legal battle being fought in the United States between Murdoch and the combined might of CNN founder Ted Turner and Time Warner.
That clash of the titans centres on whether Time Warner, the second largest U.S. cable operator, will carry News Corp's 24-hour Fox News Service in New York City. Fox is a major rival to CNN, now part of Time Warner following a recent merger. ($1=.6141 Pound)

33,"Shares in United News &amp; Media Plc climbed to record highs on Friday after the British television and newspaper group reported a 12 percent profit rise in the first year since a merger effectively doubled its size.
A media heavyweight was created last year when United News, publisher of national newspapers The Express and Daily Star, joined forces with commercial television and financial services group MAI in a three billion pound ($4.8 billion) deal.
The enlarged company said 1996 profit before tax and exceptional items rose 12 percent to 290.2 million pounds. Earnings per share increased 15 percent to 40 pence.
""I think we have delivered at the top end of expectations against the agenda we set ourselves at the time of the merger,"" chief executive Clive Hollick told Reuters.
Share analysts also gave Hollick and his team their seal of approval. United shares added 25.5p to 766p by 1600 GMT after earlier hitting a post-merger high of 769p.
Several analysts increased their forecasts for 1997 profits, which are seen in a range between 310 and 335 million pounds.
""The review of the businesses following the merger has been completed, with adjustments to the portfolio in some areas and changed operating strategies in others,"" said Hollick, who moved across from MAI.
United said savings as a result of the merger and subsequent restructuring were expected to reach 43 million pounds a year by 1998. It took an exceptional charge of 56 million pounds last year, mainly stemming from the merger.
The company has been active on the disposals and acquisitions front, spending more than 750 million pounds last year as it bought exhibitions group Blenheim and a 29.9 percent stake in regional television broadcaster HTV .
It recouped around 300 million by selling a finance company, a legal publisher and local newspaper interests.
United, which operates commercial television (ITV) franchises in southern and eastern England, said operating profit from its broadcasting and entertainment division rose by 36 percent to almost 60 million pounds.
Profit from the business services unit increased by 38 percent to 100.5 million but the contribution from financial services fell slightly to 51.1 million.
Earnings from consumer publishing dropped 7.5 percent to 81 million after a 31 million pound increase in paper costs.
Hollick said restructuring of the national newspapers should bring annual savings of 15 million pounds, some of which would be ploughed back into the titles.
The mid-market Daily and Sunday Express titles have been relaunched as a combined seven-day operation in a bid to end a long-term sales decline.
United said trading in early 1997 was ""well in line with expectations"". It is paying a final dividend of 15.5 pence per share, bringing the total for the year to 23.5 pence, an increase of two percent. ($1=.6228 Pound)

33,"The plight of English soccer team Millwall provides a cautionary tale for investors planning to buy into the growing number of clubs joining the stock market, share analysts said on Wednesday.
Millwall's financial crisis was likely to make potential investors more careful about which stocks they pick in what is a much-hyped and increasingly crowded sector, analysts said.
Millwall Holdings Plc, owners of the London second division club, have called in administrators to run the company while it seeks to put together a financial rescue package.
Shares in Millwall remain suspended on the London Stock Exchange. They were worth just 4p each before their suspension on Tuesday, having slipped away from a price of 20p when they were issued seven years ago.
""This is a warning shot across the bows. Just because it is a soccer stock does not mean that it will outperform the market,"" said Vinay Bedi of stockbrokers Wise Speke.
Shares in premier league clubs Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Caspian, owners of Leeds United, have almost trebled over the past year.
Revenue from a television deal with satellite broadcaster BSkyB and the anticipated riches from the introduction of pay-per-view in the coming years have driven growth.
An increasing number of clubs have come to the market to raise new funds and widen ownership.
Premier league glamour club Newcastle United were the latest to join the trend, announcing last week that they aimed to raise up to 50 million pounds ($83 million) through flotation.
But smaller clubs such as West Bromwich Albion have recently joined the junior AIM (Alternative Investment Market) market and their first division rivals Birmingham City and Charlton Athletic are also planning to float.
Analysts point out that there is clearly a greater risk in investing in clubs outside the premier league.
""It is not uncommon for clubs to run into financial problems but Millwall are the first time it has happened to a quoted company,"" said Nick Batram, of brokers Greig, Middleton.
""Fans will buy stocks in their favourite clubs because they want to become more involved. But institutional investors must look beyond the name and at the commercial strategy,"" he said.
""Millwall show that you can't run a lower division club on a premier division cost base,"" he said, noting that Millwall's wage bill of four million pounds last year was as high as that of premier league Southampton.
Millwall made a pre-tax loss of 2.9 million pounds in the year to end-May 1996 as the club tumbled to relegation after a disastrous run of form in the second half of the season.
The success of the premier league over the last five years has widened the gulf between the 20-club elite and the 72 members of the three lower divisions.
A study of the 1994/95 season by accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche showed that the premier league generated almost 70 percent of soccer's total income of 468 million.
But Batram said that lower division clubs, which have their own separate BSkyB deal, could still prove good bets.
""You can be a profitable and successful club in the lower divisions if you have the right cost base,"" he said.
""The key is for clubs to build their business slowly. But it's hard to do that as all fans want their team to be in the premier league."" ($1=.6021 Pound)

33,"British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc defied a steep rise in newsprint costs to post a small profit increase on Wednesday.
Pre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39 million pounds ($60.6 million). This came despite an increase of 18 million pounds in the cost of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed.
""Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,"" chief executive David Montgomery said.
""The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,"" he added.
Exceptional credits of 12.9 million pounds were realised, principally from the settlement of property related issues.
Interim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p.
Market reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding 5.5p to 207p by 1210 GMT after earlier hitting 210p.
Mirror Group's flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain's second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.
Finance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.
The group forecast that the price per tonne of newsprint should decline to 475 pounds in the second half of the year from 520 pounds in the first six months.
It said its annual newsprint bill could climb as high as 131 million pounds in 1996, an increase of 20 million pounds, and noted that the pricing trend remained uncertain. The Mirror's Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service.
Live TV's offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but the company said it was an under-valued asset.
It said that a recent independent assessment had valued the company at up to 90 million pounds and added there were no plans to dispose of it.
Live TV is connected to 1.45 million households -- 94 percent of all UK cable homes. It has special local affiliates in central London and Birmingham with plans to add the cities of Liverpool and Edinburgh by the end of the year. ($1=.6430 Pound)

33,"British television and newspaper group United News &amp; Media reported a profit rise of more than 20 percent on Thursday and said it had made significant progress since a merger earlier this year effectively doubled its size.
Pre-tax profit before exceptional items from the group totalled 151.9 million pounds ($236 million) in the six months to June 30, against last year's restated figure of 125 million.
""This has been a period of significant progress. We achieved an increase in profits of over 20 percent, and the strategy outlined at the time of the merger is being implemented effectively,"" said chairman Lord Stevens.
""There will be further initiatives in the second half to improve our operating performance and to strengthen and develop our products and franchises,"" he added.
The merger between United News &amp; Media and television and financial services group MAI, completed in April, created a major media company with a market capitalisation of over three billion pounds.
The enlarged group owns British national newspapers The Daily and Sunday Express and Daily Star and operates commercial television (ITV) franchises in southern and eastern England.
The merger spawned a management team of Lord Stevens and MAI's Lord Hollick, a duo dubbed ""The Odd Couple"" by the British press.
Hollick, now United News chief executive, is a staunch supporter of the opposition Labour party while Stevens' Express newspapers reflect his backing for the ruling Conservatives.
Hollick told Reuters on Thursday that United News aimed to complete a review of its portfolio of businesses by the end of the year. ""We have set a fairly fast pace,"" Hollick said of the first few months of life with United.
Hollick noted that the performance was ""at the top end of expectations"" but market reaction to the figures was cautious.
United shares added 9.5p to 715p in early business but gradually retreated to stand only 1p firmer at 706.5p.
The large number of exceptional items stemming from the company's reorganisation prompted the caution. Turnover was moderate as many traders sat things out while their media analysts discussed the figures with the company.
Reviewing the merger, chairman Lord Stevens said: ""One-off costs will be significant and to date amount to 56.4 million pounds"".
United will include an 82 million pound profit on the sale of specialist legal publisher Tolley in its full year figures. It will also take a charge in the second half of 32 million pounds stemming from the reorganisation of Express newspapers.
The Daily and Sunday Express titles are to be produced by a single editorial team, the first genuine experiment with a seven-day-a-week operation in the British national press.
Hollick said that the newspapers will be given time to close the circulation gap on mid-market rival The Daily Mail. The once-mighty Express sells some 1.2 million copies while The Mail has circulation of above two million all through the week. ($=0.6430 Pound)

1,"President Ernesto Samper sent a message of condolences to U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday after a U.S. pilot was killed during an anti-drug mission in southeast Colombia.
Robert Martin, 35, died when his Turbo Thrush T-65 crop-dusting plane crashed into dense jungle in Guaviare province Tuesday while he was fumigating illicit plantations of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
""In the name of the Colombian people and that of my government, I offer sincere condolences for the tragic death of Robert Martin,"" Samper wrote to Clinton.
""His death is added to all those others that have occurred in recent years during our bitter fight against the poison of drugs. The memory of Martin, and that of our policemen and soldiers, will give us additional motivation to continue the fight,"" he said.
Police said Martin, one of six civilian pilots working in Colombia under contract with the U.S. State Department, was killed on the first day of his contract.
U.S. ambassador Myles Frechette said he was the first U.S. aviator to die on such a mission.
The question of U.S. personnel taking a direct role in drug or counterinsurgency operations is a thorny issue because of what some Colombian politicians see as the possible infringement of national sovereignty.
Samper said in his letter that Martin had been ""training Colombian pilots in illicit crop fumigation.""
But since October such ""training"" functions have extended to frontline operations, including flying live missions to spray coca leaf and opium poppy plantations, State Department officials told Reuters.
Crop-dusting planes come under frequent attack from armed gangs and leftist guerrillas who guard the clandestine drug plantations.
But police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said Tuesday there was no indication Martin's plane had come under fire despite a heavy rebel presence in the area. He said the most likely cause of the crash was human error or mechanical failure.
An accident investigation was under way and Martin's body was scheduled to be flown back to the United States Wednesday afternoon. He was employed by Texas-based aviation company Dyncorp, but authorities have not said where he was from.
Colombia's U.S.-backed drug crop eradication programme is the most ambitious in Latin America. Last year the Colombians destroyed about 14,000 acres (6,500 hectares) of poppy and more than 44,500 acres (18,000 hectares) of coca leaf.

1,"Moves toward just-in-time roasting and savage cuts in coffee inventories in consumer countries will force exporters, traders and processors to resort to sophisticated financial mechanisms to offset price volatility, the head of the International Coffee Organization said.
ICO chief Celsius Lodder predicted booming growth in risk management measures such as options, futures and secondary instruments and said they would become key in influencing short and medium term coffee prices.  
They will also replace more traditional methods of building up stocks, and other physical strategies, as a buffer to sudden swings in the market, he said.
Meanwhile, in some producer countries, growers may find themselves bearing an increasing responsibility for storing the crop, thereby seeing their costs pushed up.
""Risk management, similar to an insurance contract, will become an increasingly important instrument for exporters, traders and processors,"" Lodder said in a speech organized by Bogota's Los Andes University.  
""Growers and growers' cooperatives will have to take on greater responsibilities for storing inventories. This will push up costs, reduce their cash flow and mean much of the stocks will be stored in remote areas, delaying dispatch,"" the coffee chief said.
Despite the grim message that shifting trends in consumer countries could force their costs up higher, Lodder did offer a ray of hope for Colombian growers, already hard hit by the strengthening peso and the high cost of credit.  
Lodder highlighted the growing opportunity for niche marketing of specialist coffees in traditional markets where consumer palates are becoming more sophisticated even though the overall demand in those areas may have stagnated.
He also talked up prospects of new markets opening in the former Soviet Union and China. Colombia's President Ernesto Samper, and his official delegation, returned from the Far East at the end of last week. His itinerary included China and both he and his Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia were upbeat about the chance of selling the Colombian bean to the country's 1.3 billion-strong population.  
During the visit to Beijing and Shanghai, Mejia calculated that if Colombia could sell one cup of coffee a day to every inhabitant of China, the Communist nation would absorb Colombia's entire annual harvest.
National Coffee Growers' Federation chief Jorge Cardenas did his own calculations and worked out that Colombia would have to double its coffee harvest if it was looking to meet Mejia's target.
In his speech, Lodder recognized the ICO's changing role and agreed it was no realistic for it to adopt interventionist strategies in a globalized free market.  
""The patterns of economic and political cooperation seen in the 1960s have been replaced by a new  model, perhaps more realistic and certainly different. There's no consensus for a return to intervention but the ICO is a dynamic organization and it must reflect the current situation and not be constrained by its former role,"" he said.
""I believe the ICO must remain flexible and look for the broadest possible consensus and build on the foundations of our cooperation with trade experts.""
He added that the ICO would concentrate on looking for specific solutions to specific problems as they arose throughout the coffee sector either in production or marketing.
Meanwhile, Colombia's transport system got back to normal this week after a crippling 11-day strike by truckers, which ended with an agreement early last Friday.
There has, nevertheless, been a significant delay in coffee deliveries and Cardenas forecast that about 150,000 60-kg sacks of coffee promised for October delivery would not in fact reach buyers until November.

1,"Colombia's cocaine kings, Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, were sentenced to 21 and 18 years in prison respectively on Friday, but had their terms halved for pleading guilty, bringing a swift rebuke from the United States.
Gilberto Rodriguez, who also was fined $8 million, and his brother -- fined $4.4 million -- will be eligible for extra sentence reductions for working and studying in prison.
The sentences were called ""totally unacceptable"" by U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette, whose government unsuccessfully called for the extradition of the Rodriguez brothers in July.
The public prosecutor's office said it would appeal the terms, but under Colombia's lenient anti-drug laws this would add little additional jail time.
""The U.S. government and American public opinion will be shocked by these low sentences,"" Frechette told reporters. ""These sentences are totally unacceptable,"" he said.
Gilberto, nicknamed the Chess Player for his cunning criminal mind, headed the powerful Cali drug cartel until his capture in June 1995.
Together with his brother Miguel, the pair masterminded a huge drug trafficking empire, supplying an estimated 80 percent of the world's cocaine and building up a multi-billion dollar fortune in the process.
U.S. officials have said repeatedly that the brothers continue to run their criminal empire from behind the walls of Bogota's La Picota prison.
That allegation, coupled with Friday's ruling by a judge in the city of Cali, could strike a fatal blow to Colombia's hopes of averting more U.S. trade sanctions in March when Washington will decide whether it should remain on a list of pariah states that have failed to cooperate in ther global fight against drugs.
A so-called ""faceless"" judge sentenced Gilberto Rodriguez, 57, to 21 years for drug-trafficking, conspiracy, illicit enrichment, falsification of documents and the illegal possession of weapons.
That term was immediately cut to 10-1/2 years, in return for his plea and prompt confession, and with extra reductions for working and studying in jail he will likely spend about six years in prison. With time already served in custody awaiting trial, Gilberto Rodriguez could be a free in 2002.
His brother Miguel, 53, was sentenced to 18 years, halved for his guilty plea and full confession. He will also be eligible for extra reductions.
The respected Colombian political magazine Semana recently estimated the combined fortune of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers and two other top traffickers at $50 billion. The brothers may lose part of their fortune under the terms of the new asset forfeiture law passed by Congress in December.
The office of Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso, an anti-drug crusader and close ally of Washington, said it would use all legal resources to appeal the sentences and see that ""just penalties"" are eventually imposed on the Cali kingpins.
Under current legislation, the brothers faced a maximum of no more than 24 years imprisonment.
National Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, who oversaw the arrests of the Rodriguez brothers in June and August of 1995, called Friday's sentences ""a disgrace"" and said they might just as well have been left free.
""I'm not going to continue jailing drug traffickers so they can get out in three years. It's a disgrace,"" he said.

1,"Colombia's President Ernesto Samper announced Tuesday plans to boost revenues by broadening the tax base, and said the 1997 budget would be cut by over a trillion pesos -- a figure higher than the 900 billion pesos previously approved by Congress.
The measures are part of an emergency plan to rein in the yawning fiscal deficit.
Samper said the overall rates of income tax and the 14 percent value added tax would not be raised, but he pledged to expand the tax base and combat tax evasion.  
Below-inflation wage rises for public sector workers, announced last week as part of a separate austerity law, and the merger or closure of inefficient government offices will help stem public spending, Samper said.
Earlier in the day, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo said, ""Everybody would be affected by draconian measures,"" but so far many of the proposals put forward have not yet been fleshed out.
The economic emergency has been decreed for an initial period of 20 days and allows the president to rule by decree without consulting Congress.  
""If we go on increasing the levels of public debt, we will be creating elements of instability in our fiscal system. We will be laying landmines in the path of the state's finances,"" Samper said in a speech at the presidential palace.
The fiscal deficit rose to 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 from 0.2 percent in 1995. Ocampo said Monday that the effects of the emergency measures, coupled with income from a recent spate of power plant privatizations, could cut that shortfall to 2.5 percent of GDP this year, compared to the 3.4 percent originally forecast.  
Samper said that the Expenditure Rationalization Law, which was approved at the end of last year and which included provision for a weighted 13.5 percent pay rise for public sector workers, would mean budget savings of 900 billion pesos.
He added that under the terms of the economic emergency decree, public officials had been ordered to look for ways to cut an additional 300 billion pesos from the overall national budget. This he said would lead to total savings of about 1.2 trillion pesos on a budget originally set last year at 30.3 trillion pesos.  
Although Samper gave a broad outline of the crisis measures, his speech was short on specifics.
Wilson Borja, head of the main public sector union FENALTRASE, said he feared as many as 19,000 state jobs could be slashed in the cost-cutting drive.
Although Samper talked of closing government departments, he failed to spell out the impact this could have on jobs.
The president spoke of the drain imposed on central government coffers by provincial authorities, raising the specter of funding cuts to the regions, already suffering from chronic lack of resources and social injustice.
He also said he would cut the government's external consultancy services by 50 percent and reduce official trips abroad. He did not, however, give an estimate of what saving that represented.

1,"Moves to secure the release of about 60 Colombian soldiers held by leftist guerrillas could be hampered by failure to agree on the international character of a team to mediate the handover, a Red Cross spokesman said on Monday.
""Perhaps the most complicated element (of creating a mediation commission) is whether to view it as a national or an international issue,"" a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
""The important thing for us is that these people are released as quickly as possible and in good health.""
Just one day before the deadline set by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) for creation of the commission, the guerrillas have still not nominated their own delegates to oversee the release of the prisoners, captured during a raid in southern Putumayo province on Aug. 30.
In a telephone interview on Monday, Marco Leon Calarca, part of the FARC's general secretariat based in Mexico, said they would propose Guatemalan Nobel prize winner Rigoberta Menchu.
But it was uncertain how far the government would allow the FARC to use the release of the prisoners as a chance to publicise its guerrilla war to an international audience. Some analysts believe the FARC wants to use the release to show it is a genuine guerrilla army, not terrorists and drug traffickers as charged by Colombia's government and military.
But the government is keen to treat its fight against left-wing guerrillas as a largely domestic affair and it has insisted there is nothing to negotiate when it comes to the prisoners' release.
""We want to set up a commission that carries real weight so that the government is forced to create the right conditions for the handover,"" Leon Calarca said. ""We want both an international and national presence.""
Once the commission is formed it will negotiate the timetable for the soldiers' release and witness the handover.
The troops were seized in an attack on a jungle camp in Las Delicias in which 27 soldiers were killed. It marked the start of one of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives in decades.
The government has nominated three people to the panel, Bishop of Bogota Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, former Foreign Minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo and ex-Sen. Alvaro Leyva.

1,"Thousands of demonstrators thronged Bogota's streets on Sunday calling for an end to the crime wave that has turned Colombia into the kidnap capital of the world.
At least 1,100 people have been abducted this year -- more than half of those by the warring factions in Colombia's simmering internal conflict -- according to event organisers.
National Police chief Rosso Jose Serrano, who took part in the first march of its kind in Colombia, saw it as a direct challenge to leftist guerrillas, who fill their war chests with ransoms. Scores of others clutched photos in silent tribute to their loved ones -- kidnapped by criminals.
""When you're abducted, you become like the living dead -- it strips you of your soul. Today's march is a sign that civil society is saying no to kidnap,"" said Francisco Santos, founder of Pais Libre, an independent foundation that counsels kidnap victims' families and which organised Sunday's march.
Santos, part of the family that runs Colombia's leading newspaper, was kidnapped six years ago as part of a campaign unleashed by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel.
In a move timed to coincide with Sunday's protest, one of Colombia's most-feared right-wing paramilitary leaders released the mothers of two guerrilla chieftains in the northwest.
The women were snatched in a wave of retaliatory kidnappings carried out by Carlos Castano's paramilitary gang in the last six months in a bid to persuade the guerrilla chief to halt its campaign of abductions.
An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people took part in the march. Organisers put the figure at twice that.
Norberto Garcia, 62, tearfully watched the march and subsequent rally in the historic Plaza Bolivar square. Almost a year to the day his 14-year-old daughter Andrea disappeared on her way to school in a working-class district of the capital.
""When your child is kidnapped it is like your own life ends. It's the hardest thing for a parent to suffer,"" Garcia said.
Only last Wednesday, the country was rocked by the kidnap and murder of seven-year-old schoolboy Victor Alvarez in southwest Colombia. His corpse was dumped on the doorstep of his family home when his parents failed to pay a $10,000 ransom.
But in a country where even conservative estimates put the number of abductions at three a day, the tragedy of young Victor, of Papayan, was almost forgotten by Sunday.
Anti-kidnap czar Alberto Villamizar was jeered by crowds as he delivered a message from President Ernesto Samper pledging to crack down on kidnapping.
The catcalls were preceded by chants of ""Serrano will save the motherland"", in support of the no-nonsense chief of National Police, who heads the fight against kidnapping and drug-trafficking.

1,"Colombian truckers began climbing back behind the wheel early on Friday after their leaders signed a deal with the government to end their crippling 11-day old strike.
Colombian Truck Drivers' Association (ACC) head Javier Suarez said the accord granted an immediate 16 percent raise in cargo freight rates with the promise of another inflation-linked increase at the start of next year -- short of the instant 30 percent hike originally demanded.
The breakthrough in talks between the independent association, the Transport and Interior Ministries and private transport companies came late on Thursday, a day after Interior Minister Horacio Serpa threatened to use police and the military to help smash the nationwide strike by clearing road blocks and forcing truckers back to work.
""This is a partial solution to our problems but I think it will be good for our members. This doesn't mean truckers will now be making any profits but at least we won't be operating at a loss like at present,"" Suarez told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""We have also agreed to set up a joint committee that will look at future transport policies.""
Key sectors of the economy, primarily those linked to import and export, had issued stiff criticism of the transport paralysis earlier in the day but heaved a collective sigh of relief with news of the agreement.
But the lifting of the strike seems unlikely to offer an instant fix for the crisis-hit coffee sector, which has seen 250,000 60-kg sacks of coffee -- a quarter of that promised for October delivery -- delayed by the truckers' action.
Earlier in the week, private coffee exporters said many would be forced to default on this month's delivery contracts even if the stoppage ended before the weekend because of the backlog of coffee in port and in warehouses.
In addition to the raise in freight cargo rates, a joint committee of truckers, industry representatives and Transport Ministry officials will be created to look at other concerns highlighted by the drivers' association, Transport Minister Carlos Hernan Lopez said.
These include the cost of highway tolls, the price of operating licenses and associated taxes and maximum load restrictions on cargoes.
Part of Thursday night's agreement means the Transport Ministry will send a communique to transport companies ordering them to lift unilateral bans on contracting the services of drivers operating trucks more than 11 years old where these are currently in force.
Suarez said he did not think the deal hammered out would have an impact on inflation, already running above the 18 percent originally targetted at this point in the year by the government.
""Hopefully we will not see any gains in inflation or the cost of this accord being passed on to the consumers because the intermediaries, the transport companies, will be absorbing the cost of it by taking a cut in their profit margins,"" he said.
The overall cost of the strike is difficult to calculate but certainly runs into many million dollars. Colombia's main Pacific coast port, Buenaventura, estimated its losses at more than $20 million a day because no cargo was coming in or out.

1,"Latin America's oldest and largest guerrilla army on Wednesday hailed a Peruvian rebel group's storming of the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima as a ""spectacular and well-planned"" attack.
Marco Leon Calarca, the international spokesman, based in Mexico City, of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), defended the actions of Peru's Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), which launched the raid on Tuesday night.
He said armed struggle was often the only way to break the bonds of poverty imposed by an oligarchic system.
The Colombian authorities say the formerly pro-Soviet FARC numbers about 12,000 fighters. Independent political analysts say it has more than 18,000. The Cuban-inspired MRTA is thought to have no more than about 2,000 insurgents.
""The MRTA attack was spectacular and well-planned, which suggests it does have popular support. The MRTA, like all peoples of the world, has every right to fight by all means for basic rights,"" Calarca told Reuters in a phone interview from Mexico.
""People cannot be driven into extreme poverty without putting up a fight. They must defend themselves from the aggression of neoliberalism. The oligarchy is not simply going to hand over those rights,"" he added.
Members of the MRTA travelled to Colombia in the mid-1980s to fight in the so-called America Battalion, which also consisted of Colombia's leftist M-19 rebel group and Ecuador's Alfaro Vive Carajo! The battalion launched a failed attempt to create rebel liberated zones in Colombia, starting with the southwestern city of Cali. The FARC never joined the battalion because of military and political differences.
The FARC was set up in 1964 by Communists who had fought with self-defence forces set up by the Liberal Party during 10 years of virtual civil war that started in 1948. The government now accuses it of living off a vast fortune gleaned from kidnapping, extortion and drug trafficking.
It launched one of its bloodiest offensives in August, when it killed 27 soldiers and captured 60 in an attack on a jungle base in southern Colombia. It still has not released those captives.

1,"Two Germans, thought to be members of a Colombia leftist guerrilla group, were arrested in the northwest of the country early on Sunday as they tried to smuggle a kidnap victim out of the country, police said.
They were seized at Rionegro international airport, near Medellin, at 1 am local time (0600 GMT) as they tried to bundle a third German, Brigitte Schoene, the wife of a former BASF Chemicals director snatched on Aug. 15, on to a charter plane.
A list of 83 international guerrilla organisations together with a number of false passports were found in the bags of the two detainees -- a 54-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman -- police said.
""I would dare to say that these (German) citizens we captured are the international finance heads and advisers of the National Liberation Army (ELN),"" Gen. Alfredo Salgado, head of the anti-kidnap police in nortwest Antioquia province, told reporters.
The ELN is Colombia's second largest rebel group. It is notorious for its attacks on oil infrastructure and on multi- national companies and their employees.
Gen. Salgado said the two Germans in initial questioning claimed they were carrying out an international peace mission and merely mediating the release of Schoene, seized from her home in Prados de Llanogrande, Antioquia, along with her five-year-old son and chauffeur. Both her son and the chauffeur were released hours after being snatched.
Salgado gave no details of the other guerrilla groups named in the documents seized from the couple and was unable to say if either had been linked to the German urban guerrilla groups of the 1970s.
The German Embassy in Bogota declined to comment on the arrests. Names found on the man's forged ID papers were Norbert Schroder, of Munich, and Jurgen Seidel. The woman's papers gave her name as Silvia Schroder and Isabel Seidel.
The man is also believed to have played a prominent role in the kidnap of a British, Danish and German engineer in Antioquia province earlier this year, Gov. Alvaro Uribe said. The release of the three in return for an undisclosed ransom, paid without the knowledge of the Colombian authorities, led to an angry exchange between Uribe and the German and British embassies.
In comments to reporters on Sunday, Uribe said he had spoken to Schone after her release and that she had confirmed she had been held by the ELN and complained of pyschological torture.
Colombia is the kidnap capital of the world with one person abducted every 2-1/2 hours, according to security experts. About half the kidnaps are attributed to the country's rebel armies.

1,"Pools of blood stain a dirt track that winds through the lush banana plantations of this central region, Uraba.
The bodies of two slain workers are unceremoniously dumped in the back of a truck and shipped off to the morgue, leaving heavily armed police to search for the killers amid trees laden with fruit destined for the United States and Europe.
For the last decade the banana has been synonymous with the bullet as rightwing paramilitaries and leftist guerrillas vie for the shifting allegiance of the people of this violence-torn corner of northwest Colombia. The dirty war now in full swing is just the latest chapter in the history of an industry which, for the last 30 years, has shaped politics, the economy and society in the four municipalities that make up Colombia's ""banana belt.""
""When people enjoy a banana in Europe, remember there's the pain of a whole people behind it,"" said Gloria Cuartas, mayor of the regional center of Apartado.
In the past banana workers' unions were inextricably tied to two guerrilla groups, the Maoist People's Liberation Army (EPL) and pro-Soviet Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), creating open conflict with plantation bosses.
But most EPL fighters laid down their arms under a government-backed peace initiative in 1991 and went on to form a political movement called Esperanza, Paz y Libertad (Hope, Peace and Liberty). That movement now controls the union Sintrainagro with 13,000 members, an estimated 95 percent of banana workers in the area.
RELATIONS WITH BOSSES RARELY BETTER
Relations between the bosses of the 380 plantations spread across more than 69,000 acres (28,000 hectares) and their workers have rarely been better. Labor protest has been muted and the workers have won vastly improved contract terms enabling them to earn up to $300 per month, almost twice the minimum wage, as they harvest the more than 1 million tonnes of bananas exported annually from the region.
But the FARC's power in the plantations has plummeted with the demise of the union it once sponsored and in the face of the burgeoning influence of Hope, Peace and Liberty. In a bid to regain a foothold, the rebels have targeted banana workers and Hope, Peace and Liberty members in particular.
""Now instead of having the support of the guerrillas we're their target,"" said Hernan Correa, a Sintrainagro leader whose brother was assassinated by suspected FARC gunmen last year. Correa, a former EPL guerrilla, has himself been the target of at least one assassination attempt and now rides around in an armor-plated pickup truck.
But the movement has not stood by and watched its members die. ""Some members of Hope, Peace and Liberty took the personal decision to take up arms to defend themselves ... the guerrillas committed the abuses and now they're paying the price,"" Correa said.
MORE THAN 3,000 DEAD SINCE 1989
Since 1989, 20 Sintrainagro leaders and more than 3,000 rank and file party members have been killed, Correa said. The names of banana estates Bajo El Oso, Osaka, Los Cunas and Mapana toll like a church bell in the minds of many residents of the banana belt. Almost everyone had a relative or friend among the 51 people slaughtered in a string of massacres on those estates between August 1995 and February 1996.
Critics say Hope, Peace and Liberty has gone beyond self-defense and forged a pact with the army and banana growers, specifically the region's seven main banana exporters including Banadex, a subsidiary of the multinational Standard Fruit, to create right-wing death squads.
""In Apartado they want us to end up in the hands of the multinationals and they want the peasants out (to gain access to) the oil, coal and bananas and the right to the humble peasants' land,"" Cuartas said.
Regional army commander Gen. Rito Alejo del Rio rejects claims of any such covert plot. ""Hope, Peace and Liberty has strengthened the banana industry and the regional economy through excellent labor and business relations. With the links between the union, the growers and the army there is no interest apart from the stability of the zone,"" he said.
He accuses Cuartas of being an ally of the FARC and the Patriotic Union (UP), widely seen as the rebels' political wing. He believes that while the rebels wage a military campaign Apartado's mayor is waging a potentially disastrous war of economic attrition aimed at encouraging banana importing nations to clamp sanctions on Uraba.
""In 1997 NGOs (non-government organizations) will try to convince importing countries not to buy Colombian bananas on the grounds that they're financing paramilitary groups. Cutting down the sale of bananas will lead the community to the border of chaos,"" Del Rio said.

35,"Chinese zinc producers are expected to take advantage of high international prices to export, though  this may lead to a domestic supply squeeze and firmer prices at home, Far East metal traders said on Monday.
With London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc prices having risen by around $50 a tonne since the start of 1997 to the highest levels in nearly two years, Chinese producers are seen accelerating sales, they said.
Three month LME zinc was little changed at $1,137/39 a tonne in early trade in London on Monday, after a kerb close of $1,139 on Friday. The market was seen consolidating after a blistering rise that peaked last week at $1,157.
Already this year, Torch Metal in Hong Kong, which sells on behalf of Chinese producers, has exported 30,000 tonnes of Chinese zinc to end-users ""because the price is right,"" a company source said by telephone from the British colony.
None of this metal had gone to the LME warehouse in Singapore, he said, adding that Torch had a further 50,000 tonnes of zinc to sell in the course of 1997 and would not hesitate to take advantage of price rallies.
A Chinese trader in Beijing said one of the major smelters had sold between 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes of Chinese metal in late December at 9,800 yuan ($1,180) a tonne FOB (free on board) southern Chinese ports.
That metal was exported after the government wiped out the five percent zinc export tax on January 1, 1997, he said.
""That zinc was sold before the rally, but it was still quite expensive,"" he said.
A futures trader with a state Chinese firm in Singapore said Chinese producers who sold into the market before price rises could well deliver their metal to the LME to record a paper loss, but a healthy profit in the cash market.
""They (producers) would only look at the premium picture,"" he said. ""If physical sells at a nice premium, they could sell their LME position, and sell physical based on LME prices plus a nice premium,"" he said.
Sources in Asia said LME price levels over $1,150 a tonne would make Chinese exports worthwhile.
""If the price goes up further, the quantity of (Chinese) exports will move up,"" a source in China said.
That echoed the view of a number of traders in China, Hong Kong and Singapore polled by Reuters.
Some said it could lead to another round of boom-bust trading that saw domestic Chinese zinc prices rise to 10,700 yuan ($1,289) a tonne, ex-smelter, two years ago.
The Beijing trader said China had 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes of zinc metal available for export this year.
China exports around a quarter of its annual zinc output.
Official figures show 1996 exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys rose to 226,777 tonnes, over 1995's 191,526 tonnes. December 1996 exports alone were 29,519 tonnes.
""We always believe Chinese metal will pressure the market,"" another Chinese source said. ""Most people will see a good chance in the price rises.""
But he said that once Chinese zinc producers saw they could get attractive export prices for their product, they could desert their domestic customers.
""This will squeeze domestic supplies, then domestic prices will move up, then it makes more sense to keep the metal at home because the prices are better,"" he said. ""Here we go again.""
The Beijing trader said special high grade zinc accounted for around 30,000 tonnes of Chinese exports so far this year, with the same quantity of high grade metal.
Up to 70 percent of the exports had gone to end users, he and other sources said, much of it to Japan.
Under its General System of Preferences (GSP) programme, Japan exempts metal imports from developing countries submitted for customs clearance before the April 1 start of the fiscal year. ($1=8.3 yuan)

35,"China's role as an important world trading partner is a legacy of reformist leader Deng Xiaoping, but the hard task of fully opening the country's food markets remains, diplomats and analysts said on Monday.
As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in Beijing declaring it her mission to draw China into the international fold, the sources said that on agricultural trade, China still had a long row to hoe.
Restrictions on trade in grain and other agricultural products have often been seen by trading partners, especially Washington, as political barriers to a more open Chinese market.
Quarantine issues loom large in Sino-U.S. trade, with U.S. grain officials saying, for instance, that Chinese restrictions aimed at keeping out a fungus called TCK smut deny the United States of annual wheat sales worth up to $500 million.
A high-ranking U.S. diplomatic source in Beijing said talks on this and similar issues appeared to be making progress.
The hard part, he said, would be prying open the state-controlled grain trade.
""The hard work is going to be state trading monopolies,"" he said.
""Allowing access to the market, getting away from restrictive licensing and quotas, allowing others to participate in trade, allowing the Cargills and the Continentals to import and distribute on their own account -- all this remains to be done.""
The senior representative in Asia of a major U.S. grain trading house agreed, but said progress was a long way off.
""It is something we have been campaigning for for a long time...that China's import markets and domestic distribution of grains and grain-related products should be open to foreign participation,"" he told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""I don't know that we have any great hope that there will be changes in the short term,"" he said.
He and other sources in Asia said Chinese authorities were beginning to face the fact that grain imports would always be necessary and that it would be acceptable if China could supply 85 to 90 percent of its own grain needs.
Total grain output in 1996 was a record 480 million tonnes, with a state-set target of 500 million tonnes by 2000. Total grain imports for 1996 were 12 million tonnes, down 42 percent on the previous year.
The diplomat said China's cotton industry has slowly been eased into the world at large as authorities realised it is cheaper to import than pay Chinese farmers prices that are higher than those on world markets.
""One of the arguments we keep making is that when you continue to force people to produce at high prices, it fuels inflation,"" the diplomat in Beijing said.
Deng Xiaoping's forward-looking reform policies recognised that ""no nation is an island"", another trading source said.
High tariffs as well as licencing and quota systems had been relaxed on intermediate commodities such as vegetable oil and high-value products such as apples from the U.S. state of Washington.
While movements on China's entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) did signal some hope that Beijing will open its markets, trading and diplomatic sources were not sure any changes would take place in the near term.
""It is our big hope that somehow WTO will provide the leverage for this to happen, but it is not the universal panacea,"" the trading house representative said.
""It is an evolutionary process, not a revolutionary one.""

35,"China is awash with steel and suppliers scrambling for a piece of one of the world's few active markets and keeping prices down while they go about it, traders and industry executives in Asia said on Tuesday.
""The competition is forcing prices down,"" a senior executive with a Western firm said.
Prices had fallen 10 percent and more over the past couple of months, an executive with a Japanese steelmaker said, with cold-rolled steel fetching between $400 and $430 a tonne and galvanized steel up to $100 less than that.
Steel industry figures said China was flooded with cheap steel, much of it from the former Soviet Union, and most gave a pessimistic outlook for the recovery of the Chinese market.
""I can't see the bottom yet,"" the Japanese executive said. ""People have been hoping for a recovery, but I think there is no hope for improvement within this year.""
Figures published in the official Chinese press in July showed imports of steel billet and rolled steel in the first five months of 1995 at 6.83 million tonnes, up 18.9 percent on the same 1995 period.
Exports of these products were down 31.8 percent, to 2.59 million tonnes, in the January-May period, press reports said.
A flood into Asia of European steel makers fleeing soft markets at home had increased the choice of quality products in China five-fold, the western source said.
Steel stockpiles that had been mounting since the phenomenal buying of 1993 -- when 33 million tonnes of steel entered the country -- were slowly being whittled away, traders said.
Total 1994 imports were 22 million tonnes. In 1995, they were 15 million.
Jason Zheng, senior China and regional steel analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said he estimated China's steel stockpile at 30 million tonnes.
The quality was unknown, but doubtful and should not dent China's need for high quality product, he said.
China would probably import between 12 and 15 million tonnes of steel in 1996, trade and industry sources said.
""What they need is a quality they can't get at home,"" the western executive said.
Imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States were falling, Zheng said, ""because it is low quality stuff and if you only have 12 to 15 million tonnes of imports, you must have a higher quality product coming in"".
However, the sources said China's steel market was weak and beset by a lack of cash for buyers -- and a rising incidence of contract washouts.
""Buyers are not willing to pay for their orders, not just because they don't have the cash, but because the price drops between order and delivery time and they are rejecting the cargoes or asking us to reduce the price,"" the Japanese executive said
A source with another Japanese steelmaker said major Japanese mills had cut prices by 10 to 15 percent to hold on to their Chinese customers.
""So the obvious trend is that demand is not growing as the Japanese mills had expected and as a result they have a lot of surplus to push onto the market,"" he said.
""The problem is that even though China's state-owned manufacturers are trying to produce more, they are having problems getting hard currency to buy the raw materials.""

35,"Smiles are coming back to the faces of Asian sugar traders and industry executives, who are smacking their lips at the prospect of a stabilised Chinese market and decent profits for sugar mills there.
Prices for sugar in China were starting to move to levels not only covering factory costs but providing some profits, trade and industry sources said on Wednesday.
White sugar prices in Beijing and Shanghai were around 4,400 yuan (US$530) a tonne, reflecting prices of three or four months ago, trading sources said.
Ex-factory prices in the growing regions, however, were now a good 300-400 yuan higher, the sources said.
""The lowest price in 1996 was 3,650 renminbi a tonne in the producing areas,"" a Chinese trader in Hong Kong said.
Transport to the major cities added 150 to 200 yuan, plus handling costs, he said. So current prices were indicative of when the sugar was purchased and stored.
Prices in the producing areas, notably Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in the south, had moved to between 4,500 and 4,700 yuan a tonne.
""The Chinese sugar market is still a very attractive market,"" an industry executive who runs a number of joint venture sugar factories in southern China said.
""It is not yet fully mature and there will be an inbalance between supply and demand for a long time,"" he said on condition of anonymity.
He put annual Chinese demand at eight to nine million tonnes.
""The government has stopped imports for the last three months, so I see the market getting back to normal,"" he said.
Imports in 1995 were 3.3 million tonnes. This year's harvest, which begins next month, is expected to be more than 7.5 million tonnes, over last year's 5.65 million.
Signs the market in China was beginning to stabilise were evident in the recent rise in wholesale prices for processed white sugar, he and other trade and industry sources said.
The tightness reflected in the rising prices would last until the beginning of the crushing season in November.
""The price could go to 5,000 (yuan per tonne),"" a trader in Shanghai said.
Stocks of 1.5 to two million tonnes represented two months' consumption at the current peak consumption time, he said.
Even so, traders and industry sources did not see China having to import sugar before the middle of 1997.
Some rumours that China had recently purchased five to 10 cargoes -- or a maximum of 120,00 tonnes -- of Thai sugar were seen as an attempt to push up faltering Thai raw sugar premiums.
""I find it hard to believe because there are no sugar import licences,"" a Hong Kong trader said.
""The Thai premium was falling below $60 (per tonne) two weeks ago and I suspect people are spreading this rumour to push the premium back up,"" he said.
The premium on Thai sugar to China had recovered to around $70 for March-May contracts, he said.
Another trader in Hong Kong reported a secret deal in which a monastery in rural Tibet was granted sugar import licences, which it then sold to raise money for restoration work.
He said 50,000 tonnes of import quota was involved, and had been used to purchase raw Cuban sugar at US$3,000 a tonne.
""The central government gave the quota to the lamasery, then the monks sold the quota to raise money,"" he said.
The only other detail he would provide was that the Cuban sugar was not part of the annual 500,000-tonne barter deal between Beijing and Havana, and that it would arrive in China before the end of 1996.

35,"The rise in the London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc price to a five-month high in Asia on Thursday will benefit China, one of the major sources of the metal throughout the Far East, regional traders said.
""It would be good for China because they have a lot of physical metal and they have a lot to sell from producers on the hedge side,"" a trader with a Chinese company said.
""They might buy from time to time to speculate a bit but basically they are a producer,"" he said.  
Three month LME zinc hit a five-month high of $1,064/$1,069 a tonne on Thursday, up from the metal's close at $1,054 in London on Wednesday boosted by rumours that famed financier George Soros was making a speculative play in the market.
Few traders in the region expressed surprise at the talk that a large, losing long position once held by the Spanish producer Asturiana de Zinc had been liquidated or transferred and that Soros had bought zinc or zinc-related equities.  
One trader said he heared rumours months ago Soros was buying shares in zinc producers, and had been expected to buy into the metal once his share positions were finalised.
""I think that if Soros is involved the price will move,"" the source in Singapore said.
And as the world price moves up, so will the Chinese price as regional consumers have few other sources, traders said.
China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in the first nine months of 1996 were up 16.7 percent on the same period of 1995, to 153,660 tonnes, according to customs figures.
September's exports alone were 19,165 tonnes, they show.  
China's official base metals industry newspaper, China Nonferrous Metals News, estimated late last year that total 1995 zinc production would be 1.05 million tonnes.
With domestic demand expected to be 700,000 tonnes and essential exports to reach 300,000 tonnes, the market should be kept in balance, it said.
China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corp (CNNC) said earlier this year that domestic zinc demand would reach 900,000 tonnes by 2000, from 881,600 in 1994 and 465,700 in 1990.  
Supply annually outstripped demand for the metal, CNNC said, with a surplus in 1994 of 142,800 tonnes. Chinese zinc smelter capacity is around 1.2 million tonnes a year.
Traders said Chinese zinc goes to Taiwan -- a big user with total imports of around 200,000 tonnes a year -- Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand.
Trading sources in Hong Kong, China and Singapore said demand throughout the region remained strong, riding the back of rampant economic development.  
The official China Daily reported last week that domestic Chinese zinc prices would probably drop below 9,000 yuan (US$1,084) a tonne this month, due to oversupply.
However, traders polled by Reuters said the lack of alternative suppliers, other than Australia, would keep export demand for Chinese zinc healthy.
""Far East consumers can only take the Chinese material, because if you ship anything from Europe, the premiums would be even higher,"" the Chinese trading source said.  
Chinese HX brand zinc sold out of Singapore warehouses at a fixed price of $1,100 or $1,120 a tonne, he said. Higher prices meant lower, more flexible premiums (over LME cash prices).
""When the price is $1,020, the premium is $80, $90, $100 and no one buys. Now the premium (in Singapore warehouses) is $50 for HX brand,"" he said.
""I think with the LME price coming up so much, with the price coming nearer to $1,100, they will easily let it go at a $50 premium,"" he said.
Other traders said the premium on Chinese zinc to Indonesia is currently $120 a tonne and to Hong Kong $75-$85.  
Taiwan's construction sector had slowed recently and some traders on the island had been trying to take a position and offer the metal at premiums lower than the $90-$100 levels that prevailed until recently. This has pushed the Taiwan premium down to $70 a tonne, an industry executive said.

35,"Wheat is unlikely to become a casualty of the row between Beijing and Washington over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan since higher grain production in China is slashing the need for imports, traders said on Tuesday.
""As far as we see business, we could well not have anything with China for the rest of this year,"" a U.S. trader said.
""The (Chinese) domestic crop looks good, they have cancelled a lot of orders already. Canada has enough to hold China if they do need to get into the market,"" she said.
China's 1996/97 wheat production was expected to hit a record 107 million tonnes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said ealier this month, raising its estimate from 104 million tonnes.
As a result, total imports were also revised downward by one million tonnes to eight million tonnes.
A new war of words broke out between Beijing and Washington this month after the Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy missiles and other weaponry worth around US$420 million.
Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since Nationalists fled there after losing the civil war in 1949. It opposes the sale of weapons to the island.  
China has demanded the United States cancel plans for these latest arms sales to prevent ""new damage"" to bilateral ties.
Sino-U.S. ties have see-sawed in recent years over disputes ranging from human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China to alleged nuclear proliferation by Beijing.
Ties had been slowly recovering after reaching a nadir in June 1995 with a U.S. visit by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui.
China had cancelled around 1.4 million tonnes of wheat orders from the United States since early June, the USDA said.
While some trading sources have speculated that the cancellations could be in retaliation for stalled bilateral negotiations over a fungus called tilletia controversa kuhn, or TCK smut, others put them down to the good Chinese crop outlook.
China is expected, however, to maintain its traditonal level of wheat imports from Canada of around five million tonnes a year. Canadian trade sources have said China's buying programme has already begun.
None of this has deterred U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman from his optimism that China will remain a committed buyer of U.S. wheat.
""I think the key issue myself with China is supplies in China,"" Glickman said in Chicago on Monday.  
""The Chinese have pulled their grain purchases to some degree, but I do not perceive that we will see China out of the U.S. market. I think they will be in the market, but I can't tell you for how much,"" he said after a fund-raising meeting of the Congressional Hunger Center.
The United States was not the ""preferred"" supplier of wheat to China, he said, and the two countries had issues to resolve. He expressed concern that problems such as TCK smut could be used as trade barriers.
China does not accept wheat from the U.S. Pacific northwest because it cannot be guaranteed to be free of the fungus, which it fears could spread through its own wheat crop and cut yields.
Washington claims officially that TCK is harmless, though quarantine officials have said privately that it can indeed cut yields and that treatments are ineffective.
China imported 11.59 million tonnes of wheat in 1995, up 58.7 percent from the 7.3 million tonnes the year before.
U.S. wheat accounted for 3.8 million tonnes of the 1995 total, U.S. figures show.

35,"World zinc prices that have risen to levels not seen for more than four years are good for Chinese zinc producers who will gear up output to take advantage of the hikes, producing and trading sources said on Tuesday.
While many Chinese producers have sold out of their metal, output would be boosted from April, said a source at the Zhuzhou smelter, one of China's major producers in Hunan province.
Zhuzhou's exports for the first three months of 1997 would hit 20,000 tonnes, more than for the same period of 1996, he said, though he had no comparative figure.
As with most producers, Zhuzhou had been moving its metal to Japan to take advantage of Tokyo's general system of preferences (GSP) policy that exempts developing country imports from tariffs if they are submitted for customs clearance before the beginning of the fiscal year on April 1, the source said.
""This is on long-term contracts, and you can say we're pretty well sold out,"" the source said.
This knowledge has led some Western industry sources to question just how quickly the Chinese could take advantage of the current price rally.
Trading sources said significant tonnages of Chinese zinc had been delivered to warehouses in Singapore, where it is used as collateral for loans but also is available for sales on price rises.
Talk among traders has put the amount stored Singapore at up to 75,000 tonnes, but this could not be confirmed with Chinese or Western sources.
The worldwide Zinc supply is expected to become tight in the second half of 1997. One Western producer representative said his company was sold out for the second half and he saw world prices climbing another $100 a tonne before the end of the year.
""This situation really does seem good for China,"" the Zhuzhou source said.
Zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) ploughed through a 4-1/2-year high on Monday after a sizeable fall in stocks announced last Friday.
The market touched $1,304 a tonne before settling $6 a tonne up on the day at $1,296. The metal at 0200 GMT was being quoted just a shade under $1,300 at $1,294/99 a tonne.
Premiums have begun to soften on the back of the firming prices. One representative of a North American producer said Chinese traders were quoting premiums on a cost and freight (c&amp;f) at $65 a tonne at Chinese ports.
A Chinese trader in Hong Kong, who sells registered and unregistered zinc on behalf of southern Chinese producers, said he was quoting premiums over the LME cash price basis Chinese ports at $70-80 a tonne. He said $60 would be the bottom level.
A Western trader in Singapore said Chinese smelters had sold forward, leaving domestic supply tight. Chinese trading sources agreed that metal in China is now in tight supply.
Firm domestic prices of around 10,500 yuan ($1,265) a tonne were indicative of the tightness, the Zhuzhou source said, ""but the domestic market just isn't that big"".
Some sources in China have said they think 1997 will be a historic year for Chinese zinc exports, with one local trader putting China's total for the year at half a million tonnes, with up to 80,000 tonnes done in January and February alone.
Official China customs figures show China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in January 1997 reached 30,914 tonnes, up 100.3 percent compared to the year-ago period.
China exported 226,777 tonnes of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in 1996, up 18.4 percent on 1995, the figures show.

35,"China has given the green light to corn exports but has set a minimum selling price so high above world levels that the grain is going nowhere and farmers are missing out on much-needed cash, traders said on Tuesday.
The selling price for a tonne of Chinese corn has been set at US$170 at a time when the world price is hovering around $140-150 a tonne, sources in Hong Kong and China said.
""The market is dropping so there is no reason for anyone to buy Chinese corn,"" an agent working in Hong Kong on behalf of Beijing's food trading arm China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import/Export Corp (COFCO), told Reuters.
Another veteran trader in the region said COFCO executives had told him the government had agreed in principle to the export of two million tonnes of corn.
""But there is nothing in writing,"" he said. ""We have given them bids at world price levels and they won't touch it.""
Neither COFCO nor the State Planning Commission, which issues the licences, were available for comment.
Asian traders said U.S. corn was now arriving at some Asian ports at $145 a tonne inclusive of cargo and freight (c&amp;f).
""It's nonsense to issue such licences -- why not issue them 10 months ago when Chinese corn was cheap and buyers would have lined up,"" a Shanghai trader said.
""The new (Chinese) crop is coming and the farmers are complaining that they don't have money to buy fertiliser. But still they effectively won't allow exports.""
Traders in Asia saw corn prices falling further. Expectations of a huge U.S. harvest totalling more than nine billion bushels or 228.6 million tonnes has pushed prices down by 18 percent since September.
Talk on Monday among traders on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) that China was looking for U.S. corn seemed misplaced, given that China is heading for a record crop of 115-120 million tonnes and has around 30 million tonnes of corn in storage.
CBOT corn closed one to 3-1/2 cents per bushel lower in Monday trading, with December down 1-1/4 to $2.61-3/4.
The lowest offers foreign traders and agents said they had received from Chinese corn sellers, predominantly COFCO and some Chinese trading companies with export permits, was $165 a tonne.
But traders such that price was believed to be just exploratory and was not necessarily an indication that Chinese exporters would undercut the new official price to make sales.
""But so far there is no business concluded and unless the international market price is improving, there will not be,"" another trader in Hong Kong said.
The FOB (free on board) price at Dalian was $165, they said.
The export permits had been issued with the tacit approval of Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, trading and industry sources said.
Zhu had also set the price, sources close to the process said, though one of them added: ""He's no fool, he knows he won't sell a pound at that price ($170 a tonne) today"".
Corn exports were discussed earlier this year and spurred farmers and traders to ship up to two million tonnes to Dalian to await the green light.
Fear of fuelling inflation and of leaving reserves low in case of an emergency stopped Zhu short of allowing exports, Western grain industry executives who have met with Zhu said.
This saw China miss out on the chance of earning enormous amounts of money -- $175-180 a tonne -- and buying back if necessary in the current cheaper market.
""It's great for the feed industry,"" the Chinese source said of the prevailing situation, echoing other sources who say Chinese feed mills are buying corn hand-to-mouth as prices drop.
""And for American farmers -- they must love the Chinese government,"" he said.
"
35,"Sugar producers in China are worried that a flood of imports could swamp the domestic market and drive down prices already below break-even point, industry and trade sources said on Wednesday.
White sugar prices in China's southern production belt of Guangxi province are still below 4,000 yuan ($481) per tonne, in some places dipping to 3,700 yuan ($445), traders and industry sources in China and Hong Kong told Reuters.
Break-even point was above 4,000 yuan per tonne, and prices ideally should be up to 4,200 to 4,300 yuan per tonne for the factories to make any money, a senior industry executive said.
Official Chinese media reported last week that China planned to import 690,000 tonnes of sugar in 1997.
Of that amount, 350,000 tonnes would come from Cuba, where, according to German statistician F.O. Licht, the 1996/97 sugar crop should be close to the forecast of 4.5 million tonnes.
The remainder of China's 1997 imports would come from Thailand and Australia, traders said.
Official customs figures show total 1996 sugar imports were 1.25 million tonnes, 57.5 percent down on the previous year.
One Hong Kong-based sugar trader said China's 1997 sugar imports would probably be closer to 1.5 million tonnes.
""The country has 1.2 billion people, they can consume as much as you put in there,"" he said.
A Hong Kong-based executive responsible for several sugar facilities in southern China, however, said that unless the Chinese government controlled the way in which the imported sugar reached the market, prices could be expected to worsen.
""It is a question of when the imports come in and how they are released on to the market,"" he said on condition of anonymity.
""If it is tightly controlled and it trickles on to the market, it would be OK,"" he said.
He said the experience of 1995 would hopefully have shown authorities the effect on the domestic industry of sudden and large injections of sugar on to the market.
That year, sugar imports hit 2.95 million tonnes, 90.3 percent more than the year before. Much of the imports were illegal, prices plummeted and many factories are still trying to recover.
The sugar cane crop in southern China is now being harvested, and white sugar prices are expected to keep softening until the crop is all in, around late March/early April.
China's officially-stated 1996/97 sugar production target has varied over the past few months, in one case going over eight million tonnes. Traders in the region have tended to put more store in an earlier figure of 6.53 million tonnes.
China's annual demand is around eight million tonnes.
Once the harvest is through, market prices should begin to improve, giving factories a chance to drag themselves out of the red and repay loans taken out to pay farmers for their cane, an industry executive said.
Factories have complained that the price they must pay farmers for cane is too high given the low market price for the processed product.
This year's cane price has been set at 230 to 300 yuan ($27-36) per tonne, about the same as last season, though that was a 65 percent increase on the 1994 set price. Ten tonnes of cane produces one tonne of white sugar.
""All the factories are strapped for cash to pay farmers for the cane, and so are selling whatever they can get just to bring some money in,"" the executive said.
""While there is an overhang of volume there will be pressure on prices, and introducing another 700,000 tonnes will just add another element on top of that.""
Like the factory manager, he was cautiously optimistic that China's authorities had indeed learnt from 1995.
""Calculations we've done on the back of an envelope suggest that 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes will not result in oversupply,"" he said.
But he added that if imports did go as high as some traders predicted, ""things will be quite serious"".

35,"Far East metals traders were preoccupied with one question on Monday -- will China buy copper in the midst of the current rally, or are prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) nearing precarious heights?
There was little doubt in the minds of most traders and industry sources polled by Reuters that copper prices would continue their heady rise.
Copper on the LME finished Friday trading substantially higher, with technical buying and aggressive short covering taking the red metal to fresh 8-1/2 months highs despite an unexpected stocks increase of 1,875 tonnes.
It was $2,366 a tonne at the afternoon kerb close, off the day's $2,375 high but up $38 from Thursday's finish.
Prices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) have been mirroring the LME's rises since trading resumed last week after the long Lunar New Year holiday.
Shanghai copper futures started higher on Monday, with the most active May 1997 contract opening at 23,500 yuan ($2,831) a tonne, rising 190 yuan from last week's close. It fell back a little to 23,460 yuan in early trading.
Trading sources in Hong Kong and Singapore said that as long as Shanghai rises along with the LME -- and as long as the LME continues to rise -- the Chinese should not be scared away from the market.
""We're starting to see the start of glimmers of interest from China to start re-importing metal they lent,"" a trader in Singapore said.
""But it is difficult at these high prices to see a lot of Chinese buying, though the fact remains that if they need it, there seems to be so little on the ground in China that they will have to buy it,"" he said.
Shanghai Metal Exchange figures show copper stocks at 17,524 tonnes, a level described by one Western trader as ""nothing"".
The head of a big Hong Kong trading house said there had been some signs of Chinese buying in recent weeks.
""But it's just a few hundred tonnes here, a few hundred tonnes there,"" he said, adding he had seen no indication that China's central reserve authorities had been in the market.
""They (Chinese end-users) do need to buy but they could be scared off by these price levels,"" he said. ""I think the LME will go higher -- I believe it will break $2,400 (a tonne) before we see a correction.""
Premiums on copper arrivals in Shanghai are now $120 a tonne over LME cash metals pushing the price close to $2,500 a tonne, an analyst here said.
Arbitrage opportunities were seen kept in check by high costs -- three percent import duty and 17 percent value-added tax (VAT).
""You're looking at healthy arbitrage opportunities looming, as long as there are discounts on the VAT,"" another Western source said, adding that big traders were often able to get waivers on the VAT.
Beijing's States Statistical Bureau last week released figures showing China's January copper production level at 70,000 tonnes, up 2.2 percent on January 1996.
China's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, the bureau said.
Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.
Chinese media reported last month that China's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes. Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes.
Copper imports are expected to remain high, the newspaper said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes.

17,"Anti-tobacco lawsuits brought by Florida and other state governments under anti-racketeering laws are meant to demonize cigarette manufacturers and turn Americans against a legitimate industry, a tobacco-industry lawyer said on Friday.
At a pre-trial hearing of a high-stakes tobacco lawsuit, attorney Irvin Nathan held up a newspaper article quoting Florida state government lawyers and said such publicity was meant solely ""to demonize the industry.""  
The article, published in the Tampa Tribune of Florida, quoted state lawyers as saying they want to show that cigarette makers had misled Americans for decades about the health risks of smoking and prove the industry was liable for potentially billions of dollars in medical procedures covered by a Florida insurance program.
Nathan spoke on behalf of Philip Morris Cos Inc, one of several big tobacco companies that asked the judge to throw out a Florida claim that they were liable under Florida's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  
He argued the law did not apply to the tobacco companies, which are also being sued in Florida under a separate 1994 law that may leave them liable to penalties of $1.0 billion or more.
In claims under RICO -- a type of law also on the federal books and those of many other U.S. states -- Philip Morris and the other tobacco defendents would be liable to triple damages. RICO laws are usually used to prosecute organized criminals.  
Robert Blakey, a law professor at Notre Dame University, said on behalf of Florida that the RICO claim against the tobacco companies fell easily within the scope of the law. In the 1970s, Blakey was an author of several RICO laws, including the federal legislation.
""This, your honor, is a good RICO case,"" Blakey said.
Presiding Judge Harold Cohen of the Palm Beach County Circuit Court is not expected to rule for weeks on the tobacco defendents' request that the RICO claims be dismissed.  
Still, in opening remarks before lawyers for both sides presented their arguments, he said he was inclined to allow the Florida state lawyers to go ahead with the RICO-based claims.
A jury trial of the suit is tentatively scheduled for August 1997, the judge said.
Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said in an interview that Florida's RICO claims, if successful, could open a new battle front against the tobacco industry. Attorney generals from two other states that are pressing similar lawsuits agreed with that view.  
Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, who accompanied Butterworth to the hearing along with Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, said the lawsuits filed by 19 states and several cities concerned more than just monetary damages. The lawsuits were needed to alert people to the dangers of smoking and help curb smoking among teenagers.
""That helps me sell the litigation more than the money,"" Moore said.
Moore said Florida, Arizona, Mississippi and several other state governments had allied themselves to press their tobacco cases. With several cases coming to trial next year, 1997 could prove crucial in determining whether the tobacco industry is liable for some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in health-care costs arising from smoking-related diseases.
A trial on Moore's suit begins in March in Mississippi, with Florida's set for the summer and a Texas lawsuit expected to go to trial in the fall.
""I think we will know the answer in 1997,"" Moore said.

17,"International businessman Tony O'Reilly said on Friday acquisitions by his Independent Newspapers Plc will slow considerably next year after the takeover of New Zealand's leading newspaper and other deals.
""I consider next year a year of consolidation,"" Independent Newspapers Chairman O'Reilly told Reuters in a telephone interview.  
But O'Reilly's name came up just this week in London markets as the rumored buyer of Mirror Group Newspapers Plc's 46 percent stake in Britain's Independent Newspapers Plc.
Both Mirror Group and O'Reilly, whose separate, Dublin-based firm also owns a 46 percent stake in the British title, denied a deal was in the works.
O'Reilly, best known in the United States as chairman of H.J. Heinz Co, also acknowledged his company was keeping a close eye on Australian media group John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.  
Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon who runs Hollinger International Inc, sold a 20 percent stake in Fairfax this week after complaining about Australian limits on foreign ownership of newspaper companies.
Some press reports suggest Fairfax might sell a top newspaper or become an acquisition target.
""The situation there is fluid, very interesting,"" O'Reilly said. ""You can just say the O'Reillys are looking on with interest.""  
News Corp Ltd chairman Rupert Murdoch last month sold his five percent stake in Fairfax and on Wednesday said he had lost interest in the company because of the foreign ownership ceilings. A native Australian, Murdoch is now a U.S. citizen.
Independent Newspapers owns a 25 percent stake in the Australian regional newspaper company APN, and this year acquired a controlling 85 percent stake in Wilson &amp; Horton in a deal valuing the leading New Zealand newspaper company at NZ$1.32 billion.  
""Wilson &amp; Horton will be an important springboard for us,"" O'Reilly said.
The executive said the New Zealand company would help Independent expand its commercial printing and educational businesses in the region.
O'Reilly said his executives next year would be working primarily on increasing results and efficiencies in Independent properties. Deals, in part because his family wishes to maintain its 28 percent equity stake in Independent, would be secondary.
Company results should be strong in 1997, he said.  
The company's South African properties will have to produce better than normal profit gains to offset currency losses expected from a drop in the South African rand, he said.
Independent's newspapers in Ireland, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and elsewhere will benefit from a sharp drop in newsprint. Costs for the raw material of newspapers has dropped from an average $520 a ton within the past year to around $400 currently, he said.  
O'Reilly described as reasonable profit forecasts by Dublin's Davey Stockbrokers that Independent would post a 15 percent profit rise to 18.6 pence per share in 1997 and an 18 percent rise to 21.4 pence per share in 1998.

17,"Eastman Kodak Co secured only a partial exit from bruising copier wars with a $684 million sale of its copier-marketing and service operations to Britain's Danka Business Systems Plc.
Prompted by chronic financial weakness, highlighted by the fact Kodak's copier sales of $1.8 billion yield only $20 million in annual operating profits, the sale prompted segment leader Xerox Corp to throw down the gauntlet to Danka.
""They're on our turf now and are going to have to chase us to win business,"" said Xerox executive Gill Hatch.
Hatch predicted the Danka-Kodak deal on Monday would bring pricing pressures to the copier business. ""Suffice to say that Danka has been aggressive, and will continue to be aggressive,"" Hatch said.
According to Danka chief executive Dan Doyle, the acquisition and a 10-year alliance with Kodak will give high-flying Danka a full line of copiers to offer low, middle and upmarket customers around the world.
Kodak is retaining its manufacturing and development operations in copiers, as well as some key technology.
The remaining Kodak businesses will have about $600 million a year in sales, or a third of its former turnover. Danka will be its main customer as the primary distributor of Kodak copiers and printers.
""Danka's growth will be our growth,"" said Kodak co-chief operating officer Carl Kohrt.
Kohrt predicted Kodak's rump copier businesses would be profitable by the end of 1997 and that the transaction, netting Kodak about $600 million in cash, would be immediately accretive to earnings. The deal should close by December 31.
Analyst Gary Schneider of Bear Stearns said he had hoped Kodak would have quit copiers entirely and will have to prove to Wall Street it can turn around the financial performance of the remaining copier businesses.
""The question is what kind of normalized earnings can you get out of those,"" he said.
Monday's deal is just the latest bit of corporate trimming at Kodak, which has spun off and sold businesses, generating some $8 billion. The company has in the 1990s exited pharmaceuticals, household goods and chemicals.
The company said last winter it wanted to exit or reposition its copier businesses because its financial performance was subpar and promised little hope for a turnaround as it stood.
Kohrt said the deal with Danka will stimulate sales of Kodak copiers. ""What we've really needed is pull-through from the market,"" he said.
Danka chief executive Dan Doyle said Kodak's strong focus on big customers needing high-volume copiers and services dovetailed with Danka's traditional presence among low and middle-market customers.
News of the deal boosted Danka's American Depositary Receipts, which closed up 6-5/8 at 36-1/2. Kodak closed down 1/2 at 71-3/4.

17,"In Miami, the cruise-ship capital of the world, business is bright with bountiful bookings but eyes are warily looking up the Florida coast to where The Walt Disney Co. is readying its sea-going debut.
Essentially landlocked until next year, Disney is the 800-pound gorilla of U.S. holiday-making and currently operates hotels and leading theme parks, such as its Disney World in Orlando. To many in cruising, Disney is already a leading rival for vacation dollars.
Disney, adding attractions in Orlando, Fla., and eager to keep its customers staying with Disney for longer vacations, is indeed offering week-long cruises from Port Canaveral, Fla., on its cartoon-themed ships that include stays at its parks and a visit to a Disney island in the Bahamas.
The company is already taking bookings for April, 1998, and many in the industry see Disney aiding all cruise ships -- and not just the Disney Magic and Disney Wonder due next year -- as Disney broadens a market which draws mainly older customers.
""They are great marketers,"" Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Chief Financial Officer Richard Glasier said before the industry's recent Seatrade Cruise Shipping Convention here. ""They'll open up new aspects of the business.""
Disney is renowned for family entertainment and leisure, a segment leading cruise operators courting mass markets want to win, too. An existing cruise service under a third-party licensing agreement with Disney has not had a major role in the cruise market, executives said.
""Disney promotion will add more power in marketing than this has ever seen,"" said Peter Kowal, general manager of the Cruise Holidays travel-agents chain.
On Wall Street, many worry the industry's ship-building spree is getting ahead of itself and that weak fare pricing evident last year will become chronic. Disney's two ships, weighing 85,000 tons and carrying 1,740 passengers each, will aggravate those worries.
But bookings at Carnival Corp., the industry leader with 26.9 percent of the sector's 116,616 berths worldwide, and No. 2-ranked Royal Caribbean have been very strong this year, even with the addition of many new, very large ships.
""The tone of business is terrific,"" Glasier told investors last week.
Larger ships, including the just christened Carnival Destiny, the world's biggest at 100,000 tons and 2,600 berths, are much more efficient and much more attractive to vacationers, industry executives said.
A Royal Caribbean ship features a decktop golf course and some big ships have multi-deck atriums. The race to be bigger continues, with Royal Caribbean contracting last year to buy two ships capable of carrying 3,100 people and weighing 130,000 tons. Until this decade, few cruise ships carried more than 1,000 passengers or weighed more than 50,000 tons.
Glasier said Royal Caribbean's big ships generate twice or three times the cash flow of older ships, partly because of higher fares and more on-board shops but also because of cheaper operating costs on a per-passenger basis.
Disney's entry also comes as leisure cruising is consolidating and as the industry tiptoes toward globalization from its North American stronghold. Asia, especially, is seen as a promising market.
""There's a lot of interest in the emerging markets in Asia,"" Carnival Cruise Lines President Bob Dickinson said.
Outside North America, where trips to Caribbean islands out of Florida and to Alaska from the West Coast are most popular, the markets are relatively small. Europe, the most developed market behind the United States and Canada, is only 20 percent the size of the North American one.
Carnival late last year announced a $300 million acquisition of Costa Crociere SpA, Europe's leading cruise operator, and earlier bought a stake in British tour company Airtours. The company has also reached a joint venture with Hyundai Merchant Marine for an Asia cruise offering.
""We are attempting to source passengers outside the United States,"" Royal Caribbean's Glasier said.
Royal Caribbean is studying the Asian market and may create a separate brand for the market, Glasier said.
""In Asia, the product should be different. We would probably do that with a different brand,"" Glasier said.

17,"Ordinarily seated at the rear of a courtroom, behind deep ranks of dark-suited corporate lawyers fighting anti-cigarette lawsuits, is the mystified legal defender of Dosal Tobacco Co.
""What am I doing here?"" Jose Martinez often asks as he fidgets through yet another courtroom hearing in one of the high-profile tobacco cases heading for trial.
Martinez, of the Miami law firm Martinez, Gutierrez &amp; DeCordoba, puts that question to judges and to plaintiff attorneys pressing lawsuits on behalf of sick smokers, non-smokers claiming injuries from other people's cigarette fumes and the State of Florida, which is seeking tobacco money for Medicaid costs.
""We're just a small manufacturer, a family operation. We shouldn't be here,"" Martinez insists to anyone who will listen.
Dosal -- now swept up in one of the great legal battles of the century -- is a tiny family-owned company based in Opa-Locka, a poor city north of Miami built by a real estate developer with a fanciful taste for Moorish architecture.
It makes but a few million cigarettes a year -- compared with Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the largest cigarette maker in the world, which last year shipped nearly 231 billion cigarettes in the United States alone.
Still, Dosal's name appears in three anti-tobacco lawsuits in Florida and another in Michigan, along with deep-pocketed giants such as RJR Nabisco Holdings and Philip Morris, which last year had more than $35 billion in tobacco sales.
Dosal's main customer is the Florida prison system, which sells Dosal's DTC brand cigarettes in regular and king-sized lengths to the smokers among the state's 50,000 inmates.
Even so, Dosal is named in the state's lawsuit against tobacco companies.
Dosal also makes a brand or two favored by elderly Cuban emigres in south Florida, including Competidora.
""They buy bulk tobacco and make cigarettes on machines in Opa-Locka. It's a very small operation,"" Martinez said. ""And the customers for the Cuban brands are old and dying.""
Good-humored and joking much of the time, Martinez is deadly serious about eliminating the legal threat to Dosal.
In addition to filing formal requests that Dosal be dropped, he presses plaintiff lawyers informally with arguments on the futility of suing a company with limited financial resources.
""I ask every day,"" Martinez says.
If kept in the lawsuits, including the so-called Broin class-action suit scheduled to go to trial Monday in Miami, Dosal could be made to pay a share of any monetrary judgment. The lawyers pressing the Broin case intend to ask for $5 billion or more in damages.
And while the tobacco industry has yet to pay out a dollar in court damages after four decades of litigation, leaks in the industry's defenses are widely seen on Wall Street and elsewhere.
The Broin case, being brought on behalf of an estimated 60,000 ailing and non-smoking flight attendants by lawyers Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt, is the first of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits coming to trial this year against U.S. cigarette makers.
""It's their fault,"" Martinez said, pointing to the Rosenblatts during a courtroom interview this week after a hearing in the Broin case, filed more than six years ago.
""All the other suits copied theirs.""
Martinez said the Rosenblatts, who have named 10 defendants in the Broin lawsuit, were also responsible for the Michigan anti-tobacco lawsuit which has targeted Dosal and other cigarette makers.
""I don't think we have even sold any cigarettes in Michigan,"" Martinez said. (

17,"Philip Morris Cos. Inc. Chief Executive Geoffrey Bible said Thursday that the world's largest cigarette maker was open to ""reasonable measures"" aimed at resolving anti-tobacco lawsuits in the United States.
Bible declined to comment on negotiations between cigarette companies and anti-smoking forces on a possible resolution of hundreds of lawsuits and stricter regulations facing the beleaguered but highly profitable industry.
But he told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that ""we will listen and explore all reasonable measures.""
He also said Philip Morris was willing to work with government officials to hammer out new regulations on tobacco sales, even as the industry fights a court battle against tough new restrictions on sales, especially to minors, put in place by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year.
""We are willing to work with responsible government representatives and others on a balanced system,"" Bible said.
He did not spell out what initiatives he might consider, other than to say Philip Morris favored restrictions on young people buying cigarettes and two years ago launched its own program to limit people under 21 from obtaining cigarettes.
""We do not want kids to smoke,"" Bible said.
Anti-smoking groups have said the industry targets its advertising to encourage young people to smoke.
Bible also said Philip Morris would continue fighting the of hundreds of individual, state and class-action suits it faces ""vigorously.""
Tobacco executives have met for the first time in recent weeks with state officials and anti-smoking activists on possibly settling the massive litigation against the industry.
Negotiators said on Wednesday they had met on Sunday and Monday in Chicago but reported that no deal was imminent, a White House official said after negotiators from both sides briefed White House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey.
Published reports have said the industry might pay as much as $300 billion over 25 years into a compensation fund for smokers who fall sick with lung cancer and other diseases. In return, cigarette makers would get broad shelter from lawsuits and would likely see higher stock market valuations on their tobacco and non-smoking businesses.
Outside the Philip Morris meeting, about 20 protesters wearing giant Marlboro cigarette costumes greeted shareholders arriving for the meeting at the company's biggest plant.
""Shame on Philip Morris,"" read signs carried by the protestors from INFACT, a Boston-based anti-smoking group that says Philip Morris uses its lobbying to harm public health.
Marlboro, Philip Morris' best-known brand, helps the company capture about 50 percent of all domestic cigarette sales.
Other protestors wore big ""Uncle Sam"" hats and took play money from the people dressed as Philip Morris cigarettes.
A spokeswoman for Philip Morris said the INFACT protestors were welcome to voice their opinions.
Philip Morris stock rose $1 to $41.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Tennessee, Virgina, South Carolina, Kentucky and Georgia are also major tobacco-growing states.
The maker of Chesterfields and L&amp;M branded cigarettes, Liggett last week rocked the tobacco business and Wall Street by agreeing to settle lawsuits with 22 state attorneys general
Liggett promised to pay 25 percent of its pre-tax profits for the next quarter century and label its cigarettes as addictive substances. It also agreed to hand over to the attorneys general internal documents which might bolster multi-billion dollar claims against other cigarette makers.
No cigarette company but Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group, has made such a deal. Other cigarette makers, such as Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, fiercely condemned the pact.
""It'll give everybody something to talk about, but I don't think it will cause any adverse effects in the short term,"" said William Graham, a retired Farm Credit Services loan officer in Proctorville, in southeastern North Carolina.
""I just don't think people are aware of just how much tax money tobacco generates in this country,"" he said.
""What I want to say is not fit to print,"" said tobacco grower Grady Britt of Broad Ridge, also in southeastern North Carolina, where tobacco has been a mainstay for more than 200 years.
Other growers worried that the Liggett pact was another sign that tobacco, also a major export accounting last year for about 20 percent of the U.S. net agricultural trade surplus, was headed for hard times.
""The government's going to take tobacco away from us, but they aren't going to give anything back,"" said Newberry Mitchell, a grower since the early 1960s.
""All this decision is going to do is give the government more ammunition to classify tobacco as a drug and regulate it,"" said Erskine Floyd, another grower who lives in Barnesville, North Carolina.
Easley, the North Carolina attorney general, has not filed a lawsuit against cigarette makers and said the settlement on Thursday was less important than it appeared.
He described Liggett, the fifth-ranked cigarette maker with only a sliver of the market, as a minor industry player and said the legal grounding for the lawsuits by the attorneys general was shaky.

17,"Any walkout by American Airlines pilots would hit tourist-dependent Caribbean islands like a hurricane, while Latin America's diversified economies should easily weather a service-stoppage.
""A hurricane hits only one island, and this will hurt all the islands,"" said Antonio Colorado, executive director of the Caribbean/Latin America Action economic organisation.
A halt by American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., which dominates U.S. service to the Caribbean and Latin America, would come just at the height of the Caribbean tourist season and cause economic havoc, regional industry, political and economic offcials and analysts said.
The roughly 160,000 hotel rooms in Barbados, St. Lucia, Aruba and other Caribbean islands are 90 percent occupied on average and losses from a strike could total $15 million each day of the North American winter, Colorado said.
""Few hoteliers in the Caribbean could be expected to sustain the loss of such revenue for more than a few days without terminal effect,"" said Caribbean Hotel Association executive vice president John Bell.
American, now in labour talks with its pilots, and its American Eagle subsidiary account for as much as 70 percent of the flights between the Caribbean and North America. Some 7.2 million North Americans travel to the Caribbean each year.
Some Caribbean economies are 50 percent or more tourist reliant, and region-wide tourist spending adds up to some $11 billion each year.
Grenada, Martinique, St. Kitts and St. Lucia are among the islands most reliant on American services.
""An American Airlines strike would be devastating to us at this time,"" St. Lucia's Prime Minister Dr. Vaughn Lewis said.
Some manufacturers and shippers of perishable goods from Latin America and the Caribbean would be hurt by a stoppage at American but the interruption in passenger traffic to Latin America would be short-lived, economists said.
""I think it would be little more than a blip,"" said Terry McCoy of the University of Florida in Gainesville.
Much of the travel between North America and the bigger countries in South America such as Argentina and Chile is by business people and much commerce can be carried out by telephone and otherwise.
""A lot of people who would take trips can use faxes,"" said Jerry Haar at the North-South Centre, a think tank at the University of Miami. ""There would be a disruption but it's not anything which can't be recouped.""
Cut-flower exporters from Ecuador and Colombia and seafood or horticultural shippers could also be hurt, Haar said. Some shippers of other goods might also face higher transport rates.
But overall the manufacturing and services businesses throughout Latin America were unlikely to feel many effects from a strike, economists said.
Aviation consultant Stuart Klaskin of Miami said a strike running a week or more might be a boon to U.S. rivals of American Airlines such as Delta, United Airlines and Continental Airlines. Each would likely seek to increase flights or add destinations.

""There's no such thing as a volume discount,"" said automobile-industry analyst Maryann Keller at Furman Selz in New York. ""It makes no difference whether you're buying one million cars or 20.""
Keller said the big Detroit manufacturers do give fleet discounts to buyers but the terms have been getting tougher.

17,"Tobacco-industry lawyers in the $5 billion Broin secondhand smoke case on Tuesday touched off a testy outburst from the trial judge, who accused them of muddling the minds of prospective jurors with trick questions.
""We pull them apart,"" Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye told Edward Moss, an attorney for Brown &amp; Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain. ""We are playing with their heads.""
Kaye, speaking towards the end of a second, slow day of jury selection in the landmark trial, criticised the questions put to jurors by Moss and attorneys for other big tobacco companies such as Philip Morris Cos Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco as too firmly aimed at uncovering anti-smoking attitudes among the prospective jurors.
""You have been playing with people's heads for two days ...,"" Kaye said.
Kaye said smoking was a widely controversial practice, making it impossible to find a fully neutral jury of six and as many as a dozen alternative jurors to hear the case. Florida law only required that jurors be able to put aside their prejudices and decide on the evidence presented, he said.
Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney for the 60,000 sick flight attendants represented in the Broin class-action suit, said, ""These are consumate mind games that are being played by very skilful lawyers. Their problem is that they are looking for people that live in a cave ... uninformed people.""
The clash came after the questioning of a young musician who said her voice had been harmed from secondhand smoke while singing in nightclubs. But, under follow-up questioning by Kaye, she said she could set aside her belief that cigarettes should be banned in the United States and decide a verdict just on the evidence presented at the trial.
Kaye refused a tobacco lawyers request that the musician be bumped as prejudiced against cigarette makers but she can be dropped later if the tobacco lawyers choose to use one of 27 juror challenges they may make without explanation.
The woman was just one of six prospective jurors who survived some six hours of courtroom questioning on Tuesday. The other five included an organiser of Miami's annual Orange Bowl parade, a retired police dispatcher and a bookings manager for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. Eleven people have now made past the initial round of attorney queries.
At least a dozen more people are to be questioned on Wednesday, Kaye said.
Earlier, the judge sided with tobacco lawyers who opposed a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups, instead of one by one. Kaye said that, while he was eager to get a jury in place, he was worried about possible fallout from news stories on the trial and feared that inflammatory opinions expressed in open court might unfairly influence a verdict.
Individual questioning of potential jurors in the case, known as Broin vs. Philip Morris et al, would continue ""so as to not infect the rest of the panel with some dangerous remarks,"" Kaye ruled.
In the historic case -- the first class action and first secondhand smoke case against the tobacco industry to go to trial -- non-smoking airline flight attendants are suing nine cigarette companies for maladies they claim were caused by smoke from airline passengers' cigarettes.
In the first two days of jury selection prospective jurors expressed widely varying opinions about cigarette smoking.
One said secondhand smoke very likely caused disease in non-smokers while another compared lawsuits against tobacco companies for smoking-related illnesses to suing Kentucky Fried Chicken for Americans' high cholesterol.
Rosenblatt has said he intends to ask for $5 billion or more in damages if tobacco companies are found liable for the lung cancer and other tobacco-related ailments among the flight attendants. Smoking on U.S. passenger jets was banned in 1988.

23,"Prospects for comprehensive reform of U.S. banking and financial services laws remain bright despite a far-reaching proposal being considered by the Clinton Administration that has upset some banks.
Most in government and the industry now agree that the 60-year-old Glass-Steagall Act separating banking from other financial activities like insurance and securities dealing should be scrapped.
But there is little consensus about removing the barriers between financial firms and other commercial companies, a position the administration is actively considering for its reform proposal expected in the next two months.
""The feeling is still very, very good that everyone wants Glass-Steagall reformed,"" former Congressman and bank lobbyist Larry LaRocco said.
With almost two years left for the 105th Congress, legislators should have sufficient time to come to agreement, added LaRocco, managing director of the American Bankers Association's securities section.
""There's tremendous momentum building. Maybe it won't be in 1997 but certainly within the 105th,"" he said.
Federal courts and regulators spurred the momentum last year by lifting many restrictions on banks' non-banking activities, LaRocco noted.
As previously reported, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is weighing the recommendations of a task force headed by Under Secretary John Hawke to remove all barriers between financial and non-financial companies. Under the plan, a company like General Electric Co. or Microsoft Corp. could own or be owned by a financial services company like Citicorp or Aetna.
""There has been an enormous amount of movement on the whole issue in the last two months,"" a person familiar with the administration's deliberations said.
Among various bills in Congress and the administration, the commerce issue ""is the last issue that's left, which is an indication of how far we've come. For the first time, the omens are good and this is the only hang-up,"" the person said.
The remaining ""hang-up"" has raised strong opposition from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach along with smaller banks and consumer groups.
""There is no public support and no economic need for the conglomeration of financial institutions and other businesses,"" the Iowa Republican said. ""The nation needs to be concerned about creating jobs, not simply consolidating ownership.""
If the administration pushes ahead with the Hawke plan, it would create a ""much longer debate and prolong the process,"" one Leach staffer added. ""This is an issue which (Leach) feels has not been fully debated,"" the staffer said.
Small bankers agree. ""It's a proposal that would essentially change and concentrate not only the financial structure of the United States but the whole economic and financial structure,"" said Ken Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America.
Such concentration would be bad for the economy, Guenther added. ""It is based on very debatable assumptions.""
One bill in Congress includes a possible compromise approach, lobbyists noted. Representative Marge Roukema's bill would allow banking, insurance and securities firms to merge and would allow such companies to derive up to 25 percent of their revenues from non-financial activities.
The New Jersey Republican, chairwoman of the House Banking Committee's Financial Institutions subcommittee, has lined up some big guns behind her bill. The Alliance for Financial Modernisation, a coalition representing most the large trade groups involved in financial services, broadly endorsed the bill.

23,"U.S. laws governing the trillion dollar futures markets could be rocked by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the word ""in"" in a case to be argued Wednesday. But a legislative solution is in the offing.
At issue is a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act, the primary law regulating trading of futures contracts on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity.  
Futures exchanges say a broad reading of the amendment would put them out of business, while major banks argue a narrow reading would force them to move vast operations out of the United States.
Whatever the outcome, Congressional action is expected next year. ""It's certainly significant, but I suspect that at the end of the day, legislation will overtake this,"" said Howard Schneider, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission general counsel.  
When Congress expanded the commodity act in 1974 to cover futures on non-agricultural commodities and created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to police the markets, some big banks objected.
They argued the law should not apply to trading of foreign currency, government securities and similiar items already flourishing among banks and securities firms.
The Treasury Department agreed and in a letter to Congress suggested an amendment to the law that became known as the Treasury Amendment.  
The amendment says ""transactions in"" foreign currency, security warrants, repurchase options, government securities and a few other items are exempt from the Commodity Exchange Act unless they involve sale for future delivery conducted ""on a board of trade.""
The banks continued to trade foreign currencies unimpeded but the CFTC began to encounter a new problem. Unscrupulous ""bucket shops"" that peddled off-exchange commodity contracts to rip off unsuspecting investors were expanding into foreign currency schemes.  
The CFTC shut down the forex shops but lawyers for the shops argued forex investment contracts should be considered transactions ""in"" foreign currency and exempt from CFTC rules.
Lower federal courts took up the issue but reached conflicting conclusions. Some said ""transactions in foreign currency"" exempted dealings only with actual currencies, not derivatives on the currencies like futures and options. Others decided that ""in"" exempted all trading involving currencies.
The Supreme Court will likely resolve that conflict in Wednesday's case concerning William Dunn, the manager of a $180 million hedge fund investing in foreign currencies.  
In November, 1993, Dunn told his investors he had lost $95 million. The CFTC soon charged Dunn with fraud under the Commodity Exchange Act. A lower court agreed.
Asking the Supreme Court to uphold that decision, CFTC lawyers argue that Congress would have used the word ""involving"" rather than ""in"" if it had wanted to exempt forex derivatives.
But Dunn's lawyers and four banks that dealt with his fund maintain that the CFTC has no jurisdiction to prosecute under the commodity act.  
Affirming the earlier decision would undermine the $40 billion a day global currency market by subjecting it to unworkable regulation, the banks said. And Dunn, if guilty of any misconduct, could be prosecuted under wire fraud or securities laws, the banks said.
At the other extreme, the Chicago futures exchanges appear terrified the court will strike down the lower court ruling.  
Chicago Board of Trade, in an amicus brief written in part by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, warned that a broad reading of the exemption would create havoc, allowing unregulated dealings in all kinds of futures contracts now traded on exchanges.
""The idea that someone could clone the Board of Trade's principal products, trade them off-exchange and not be subject to any regulation is pretty darn troublesome,"" Mark Young, another exchange attorney, said.
A ruling is not expected for months, but the banks and exchanges will have to continue their struggle in the legislative venue almost immediately.
Congress could resolve the dispute through legislation, which would render the decision moot. One bill was introduced in the last Congress to amend the Treasury Amendment and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) has said he will likely offer a new bill early next year.

23,"A top federal regulator Thursday urged banks to be more careful in issuing credit cards as an industry group reported that late payments by consumers jumped to a record level at the end of last year.
The latest sign that consumers are overburdened with credit card debt came in survey by the American Bankers Association.
The group said that in the fourth quarter of 1996 late payments jumped to 3.72 percent of credit card accounts, the highest rate since it began tracking delinquencies in 1980 and up from 3.34 percent a year earlier.
The survey, in conjunction with earlier reports that personal bankruptices are at record levels and bank losses from credit card loans are growing, has bank regulators on edge.
Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, whose office oversees almost 3,000 nationally chartered banks, said the problems, while still under control, raise concerns about the safety and soundess of banks.
""We are continuing to see signs of slippage in some areas that you and we must address now,"" he told a New York State Bankers Association meeting in Washington on Thursday.
""It is worrisome to consider that there was a 44 percent growth in credit card losses and a 50 percent increase in credit card delinquencies during the past year,"" Ludwig said.
Ludwig also noted that bank chargeoffs on credit cards ""increased significantly"" in January to 6.5 percent of the $220 billion of loans outstanding from 4.7 percent a year earlier.
""These statistics are particularly troubling given the current health of the economy,"" he said.
As a result, the Comptroller's office issued an advisory to banks on credit underwriting standards and portfolio credit risk management, Ludwig said.
""The role of the regulator is to take action before potential problems become real problems,"" Ludwig said. ""Our goal is to remind national banks how changes in underwriting standards affect overall portfolio credit risk and to highlight the key component of an effective portfolio credit risk management process.""
Tighter loan standards should prevent the problem from getting out of hand, but losses may grow further before the new standards have an impact, Ludwig said.
""Current losses likely represent weaker credits making their way through the pipeline,"" he said. ""We can expect some continued losses, but hopefully we'll begin to see positive effects of those cautious underwriting decisions.""
Bankers had expected that tighter credit standards put into place in recent years would already have started reducing losses.
""We are disappointed that the numbers didn't improve,"" American Bankers Association chief economist James Chessen said. ""We had hoped that banks' tightening of credit standards over the last several years would have reversed the trend of delinquencies by now.""
In the fourth quarter of 1996, 37 percent of banks reported tightening standards, a drop from 49 percent in both the second and third quarters of 1996, the association said.
Delinquency rates also ticked up on home equity loans, the group reported. The delinquency rate was 1.42 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.29 percent in the previous quarter and 1.41 percent in the same period the previous year.
On auto loans, the delinquency rate was 2.03 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.95 percent the previous quarter and 1.87 percent a year earlier.
Delinquent payments are defined as 30 days or more overdue.

23,"The Clinton administration will modestly revise controversial export rules for computer encoding technology after a private meeting Wednesday with computer and telecommunications companies, a top Commerce Department official said.
""This is a work in progress,"" Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said in a telephone interview after the hour and a half long meeting. ""There will be some changes that will be more than technical.""  
The administration circulated a draft this week of new rules that would overhaul Cold War era export limits on products containing encryption, computer programs that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key.""
With the growth of the Internet and online commerce, demand for encryption-capable products is growing worldwide. Coded messages can keep a business' e-mail confidential or protect a consumer's credit card number sent on the Internet.
Reinsch and others who attended Wednesday's meeting said the tone was civil.  
""We had a long meeting but it was actually quite a constructive one and actually also a polite one,"" Reinsch said.
Industry officials argued at the meeting that the draft rules were unclear or unworkable on a number of points.
""In some cases we could tell them what we meant which made them feel better and now we'll go off and try to fix it,"" Reinsch acknowledged. ""In other cases we're going to have to think a little more about what they said and in some cases I'm not sure there is a way to fix it.""  
""We are not optimistic that these (rules) will be turned around and we feel going to Congress is our only option,"" Smiroldo said. The alliance includes a dozen large software firms including Microsoft Corp and International Business Machine Corp's Lotus Development.
Several bills that would dramatically ease encryption export limits were introduced in the last Congress and are expected to be revived next year.
Ambassador David Aaron, appointed by President Clinton as special envoy for cryptography last month, also attended the meeting, Reinsch said.
The draft rules implement an executive order signed by President Bill Clinton last month. Under the order, limits on export of products containing strong encryption would be eased if the products allowed the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the keys.
The draft rules detail for the first time the government's definition of acceptable key recovery features and other aspects of the revised export approval process.
For example, until 1999, companies will be allowed to export some products that do not include key recovery if the companies promise to include key recovery in future products. -- 202-898-8312

23,"An influential economic research group is preparing guidelines on computer encryption for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft obtained by Reuters.
The Clinton administration, seeking to rally support for its controversial policy on exporting encryption products -- which encode and decode e-mail and other computerized messages -- failed to win an endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), although the group did discuss the administration's approach.
On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favour or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programmes provide a way for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.
After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft report said, ""this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful access.""
On all the controversial areas in the draft, ""the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide,"" John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, said in a telephone interview from Paris.
Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a way to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden said. But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch criminals and global terrorists, he said.
The guidelines suggest encryption users should have access to products that meet their needs. Government controls should be ""no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities.""
Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and approaches.
""It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not an attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt,"" Dryden said. Cryptography refers to products and systems used in encryption.
The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be ""determined by the market in an open and competitive environment.""
""There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs,"" Dryden said.
U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised the guidelines. ""They're an important and helpful step forward,"" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.
""They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this,"" he added.
Reinsch said most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement. Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.
U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the draft guidelines.
""This is not helpful,"" said Netscape Communications Corp.'s public policy counsel, Peter Harter. Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free-market policies, he said.
The draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private-sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by a top-level OECD officials from the group's 29 member countries, including the United States, Japan and Germany.

23,"The number of consumers and businesses filing for U.S. bankruptcy protection continued a dramatic rise, hitting a record 335,073 in the first quarter of 1997, the American Bankruptcy Institute said Tuesday.
The first quarter total, the fifth straight quarterly record, was up 26 percent from 266,149 in the first quarter of last year, the non-partisan research group noted.
Consumers filed more than 321,000 of the first quarter petitions, about 96 percent of the total and a rise of 27 percent from a year earlier.
""The continued record pace of bankruptcies tracks the sustained growth in consumer spending and debt,"" said the group's executive director, Samuel Gerdano said.
After consumer filings surpassed the 1 million mark for the first time last year, the first quarter's pace ""suggests that 1997 will surpass the 1996 record,"" he said.
The quarter's bankruptcy surge has already hit some consumer lenders.  Credit card giant Advanta Corp. shocked Wall Street when it reported a loss of 43 cents a share for the first quarter.
""Credit card debt is playing a big role in bankruptcy trends,"" said George Salem, banking industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co. in New York. And bankruptcies, in turn, have been depressing credit card company profits, Salem said.
""It's like continuing to be punched and it's going to be a while before it stops,"" Salem said.  Card issuers are cutting back on lending and tightening underwriting standards, but the current problems result from loans made more than a year ago, he said.
Looking at the 12 months ended March 31, 1997, Hawaii had the largest increase in bankruptcies, with a 61 percent jump. The northern section of West Virginia followed closely behind with a 60 percent rise.
About 70 percent of consumers filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, where unsecured debt is wiped out and the debtor is allowed to keep some property.
Some card companies maintain that more consumers should be forced to file for Chapter 13 reorganizations, where debts are not wiped out but must be repaid over several years.
Visa USA said this week that its analysis of bankruptcy petitions showed that mounting credit card debt was not responsible for the rise in bankruptcies.
""This analysis refutes the notion that bank credit cards are largely responsible for the increase,"" Visa USA Senior Vice President Kenneth Crone said.
Crone said the analysis showed people with an ability to repay some of their debts were filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. ""People who can repay a portion of their debts should be required to do so,"" he said. ""Until this changes, lenders and consumers will continue to foot the bill.""
But consumer groups disputed the Visa findings and said excessive credit card debt was directly implicated.
""They are not making the correct comparisons,"" said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. ""The only two figures that really matter are the average income and average credit card debt of bankrupt people.""
Among people who file for Chapter 7, the average income was about $20,000 and the average credit card debt was about $17,000, Brobeck said.

23,"The number of banks charging non-customers for using their automated teller machines doubled over the past six months, a consumer watchdog group said Tuesday.
About 45 percent of ATMs added the controversial surcharge, on top of the fee most consumers already pay their own banks for using another bank's machine, up from 23 percent in October, according to a survey by U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
The non-profit consumer advocacy group also found that the average fee had risen 20 percent to $1.15 from 96 cents.
""Banks aren't earning money the old-fashioned way. Instead, they're gouging consumers,"" Edmund Mierzwinski, program director for the group, told a press conference.
Two states, Connecticut and Iowa, have banned the practice of charging non-customers and 12 other states, along with the federal government, are considering similar legislation.
Mierzwinski endorsed those efforts and said consumers should avoid using machines that impose a surcharge.
The rise in fees followed a decision one year ago by the two largest ATM networks, Visa's Plus and Mastercard's Cirrus, to lift a prohibition on surcharges.
Banks defended the practice and said the additional fees helped pay for ATMs in new locations.
""The marketplace should decide the prices for ATMs, not the government,"" the American Bankers Association said in a statement. ""Price controls will only inhibit innovation and put a halt to future ATM growth.""
Banks added almost 17,000 new ATMs last year, a 13 percent increase, according to a survey by the publication Bank Network News. With surcharges now permitted, ""ATM growth is accelerating,"" editor Don Davis said. ""It's a better business to be in, so more people are getting in.""
Big banks were more likely than smaller ones to impose a surcharge, according to the survey. Among the 300 largest banks, 53 percent of ATMs had a fee while only 40 percent of smaller bank ATMs and 6 percent of credit union ATMs charged a fee.
That could raise antitrust law implications if large banks banded together to impose fees and drive smaller competitors out of business, Mierzwinski charged. ""Not only are big banks using their monopoly muscle to punish consumers with higer fees, but their strategy is to use the surcharge to hurt small banks and credit unions as well,"" he said.
Customers of small banks, which have fewer of their own ATMs, would likely have to pay a surcharge more often.
Banks say free-market competition is functioning properly. ""Competitions is already keeping ATM pricing in check,"" the ABA said.
The consumer group said it surveyed 860 ATMs chosen at random in 27 states and the District of Columbia. The highest rates of surcharging were in the South, with 93 percent of Texas ATMs imposing a surcharge, 95 percent in Georgia, and 88 percent in Viginia and North Carolina, the group said.

23,"Legislation to dramatically relax U.S. export restrictions on computer encoding technology moved ahead on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee approved the measure.
The bill, known as the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act, now goes to the House International Relations Committee where opponents plan to make their stand.
Encryption, computer programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" has become an essential component of global communications and electronic commerce over the Internet.
The Clinton administration has opposed the bill and similiar measures in the Senate, arguing that allowing strong encryption out of the country will put it in the hands of international criminals and terrorists.
Representative Bob Goodlatte, the bill's author, said he had spoken to administration officials on Tuesday and hoped a compromise could be reached.
""We're very, very close in many areas,"" the Virginia Republican told reporters after the committee vote. ""The export control issue is probably the area that we're still the furthest apart on.""
After the votes, administration officials emphasised the differences. Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said the administration ""is disappointed that the committee acted precipitously. The bill contains serious deficiencies.""
Goodlatte's bill also would write into law the current policy of allowing unrestricted domestic use of encryption.
The bill would criminalize the use of encryption to conceal information related to the commission of a felony.
Software industry officials and privacy advocates, who have strongly opposed the export limits, urged lawmakers to continue moving the legislation forward.
The International Relations Committee ""will have a go at it but it's great to have some momentum,"" Netscape Communications Corp. public policy counsel Peter Harter told Reuters after the vote. ""We've come a long way in a very short period of time. This legislation is moving at Internet time.""
Jonah Seiger, communications director at the Centre for Democracy and Technology, said the vote was a ""historic moment.""
""The Judiciary Committee agreed that the administration has the wrong policy sending a very clear signal that we need to change direction,"" Seiger said.
Before the vote, committee chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois prohibited amendments to the bill on the controversial export section. Hyde said the export section fell under the jurisdiction of the International Relations Committee.

""We are confident that all of the major systems will be fixed,"" said Sally Katzen, who is coordinating much of the repair effort from her post as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget.
""That is what we are setting out to do and that is what we will do,"" she pledged in an interview.
Legislators in Congress have also taken an interest in the subject and prodded agencies into action. Most are well aware of the problem, congressional staff say, although a few slackers, including the air traffic control system, are raising concerns.
""Congress is sounding the alarm and will keep sounding it until this problem is solved,"" Representative Steve Horn said in an interview.
Horn, chairman of the Government Reform Committee's Management, Information and Technology subcommittee, has taken testimony from a variety of government and private-sector experts on the year 2000 problem.
""I have learned that the real challenge it poses is to management,"" Horn said. ""Software experts are capable of fixing the problem, but can management understand what is at stake, make it a priority, organise a plan and allocate resources so the technical experts can do their job?""
The subcommittee surveyed government agencies about year 2000 awareness last year and responses to an updated survey have just come in. The latest survey found that all agencies are aware of the problem and most are ready to put the needed fixes in place, a congressional staffer said.
Some of the agencies that people are most concerned about, the Defence Department and the Social Security Administration, appear to be in good shape and have extensive plans to fix the problem well before Dec. 31, 1999.
At the Defence Department, ""we are treating it much as we would a computer virus,"" Assistant Secretary of Defence Emmett Paige told Horn's subcommittee.
Although weapons systems are not set to launch automatically by computers, problems could crop up when the weapons interact with command and control systems that are operated by computers, congressional staffers explained.
During the Gulf War, a command and control system that was scheduled to run for 12 hours began shutting down weapon systems it was in contact with after running a few hours past its deadline.
""That would obviously be a disaster, but they're working on it,"" said one staff member.
Social Security is also a primary focus of concern, but for more political reasons. Millions of voters depend on their Social Security checks for meeting basic living expenses. If the checks were delayed or cancelled, Congress would probably be inundated with thousands of complaints.
""They started the earliest but they have a lot to do and still aren't finished,"" a staff member said. ""My sense is that they will be fine.""
One agency of concern, according to congressional staffers, is the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the country's air traffic control system and inspects commercial airplanes.
""The Department of Transportation is very worrisome,"" one staffer said. ""The FAA is still in the assessment phase. That's the one that's a real concern.""
The agency cannot give an estimate of how many lines of code it has that must be changed or how much that might cost until it completes an assessment expected by the end of May, according to Mary Powers-King, who heads the FAA's information technology effort.
""It's somewhat painful because no new funding has been appropriated and we're having to reprogram to absorb the activity,"" Powers-King said. ""That is a big part of the reason why we started late. We've got that figured out now and we've got to just bite the bullet.""
Overall, recent estimates indicate the federal government will need to spend $2.4 to $2.5 billion to identify and correct year 2000 computer problems, Katzen said. The estimate has risen slightly from about $2.3 billion a few months ago.
""I wouldn't be surprised to see them come another ($100 to $300 million) as we continue through the process of assessment,"" Katzen said. ""But I think that we've got it in just about the right ballpark.""
In a Feb. 7, 1997, report to Congress, the budget office projected that the military needed the largest portion of the money for updates. The Air Force would require $371 million, the Army $218 million, the Navy $90 million and other defence-related areas $291 million.
Other big spenders in the report were the Treasury Department, needing $319 million, and the Veterans Administration, needing $144 million.

23,"The Internet could provide a huge boost to the U.S. economy if the federal government pursues ""free market"" policies in cyberspace, a group of President Clinton's top advisers says in a draft report obtained by Reuters.
The group, an interagency task force headed by senior presidential adviser Ira Magaziner, recommended that the administration work globally to protect the Internet from new taxes, censorship and other onerous forms of regulation.
After seven months of deliberations, the task force is preparing to issue for public comment a report of principles and policies the Unites States should pursue, Magaziner said in an interview.
""One of the things we're trying to do with this paper is as much say what government should not do as say what they should do,"" Magaziner said. ""A lot of what industry is concerned about is that governments are already beginning to take actions around the world that would inhibit commerce.""
The growth of Internet commerce could help boost U.S. exports of everything from movies and news to software and consulting services. Exports of such products totalled $40 billion in 1995, the draft report noted.
The idea is to hitch U.S. exports to the speeding Internet commerce train. Sales of goods and services online are projected to grow to $7 billion in the year 2000, from about $1 billion this year, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.
""Companies have told us there would be a tremendous potential to increase world trade across the Internet if we could provide the right kind of environment,"" Magaziner said.
The draft report, called ""A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,"" covers nine issues, from taxation and customs to privacy and security.
On taxation, the draft report echoes a report issued by the Treasury Department last month by stating no new taxes should be imposed. Acting through the World Trade Organisation, the United States should push for the Internet to be designated a duty-free zone, the draft said.
Some consumers worry that their privacy will be violated when they shop online. The report said governments should push vendors to disclose what will be done with information about consumers rather than dictate to merchants what they can or cannot do with the data.
On some issues, such as encryption -- encoding information in a scrambled format to provide a measure of security or privacy -- existing administration policies may be seen as conflicting with the free market approach of the draft report.
Magaziner said policies will evolve over time, ""but the paper will reflect where we are now.""
Magaziner headed Clinton's failed effort to reform the U.S. health care system, an initiative critics said favoured government over the private sector.
While disagreeing with his critics' characterisation of the health care plan, Magaziner said the Internet ""is a wholly different animal.
""I'm a problem solver, not an ideologue,"" he said.

29,"China rejected on Tuesday an invitation for one of its top policymakers to visit Taiwan, saying the island must first abandon its bid to break out of diplomatic isolation.
""It is impossible,"" a spokesman for the cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office said when asked if the office's director Wang Zhaoguo would accept the invitation from Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan.
The spokesman said the time for such a visit was not ripe because Taiwan had yet decided to abandon its ""pragmatic foreign policy"" of trying to boost its international standing.
""Taiwan...should not seek to enter the United Nations,"" the spokesman told Reuters by telephone. Taipei lost its seat in the United Nations when Beijing took its place in 1971.
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and insists the island is not entitled to official links with other states.
If Wang had accepted and Taiwanese authorities had allowed him to visit, he would have been the most senior Chinese official to set foot on the island since the end of China's civil war in 1949.
Last week, a spokesman for a delegation of Taiwanese business leaders visiting Beijing quoted Wang as saying he would be happy to visit Taiwan if he had an opportunity, but that there was no definite commitment to accept.
The backpedalling by China on Tuesday indicated it was unwilling to make up with Taiwan for now, said a Chinese analyst familiar with Beijing government policy.
Ties between Beijing and Taipei were strained after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to the United States last year in a bid to lift the island out of diplomatic isolation.
China held war games and missile tests off Taiwan in a show of force in the run-up to the island's first presidential elections in March, which Lee won by a landslide.
Taiwan, an island with a population of 21 million, is eager to make up with its giant neighbour, the world's most populous nation with 1.2 billion people.
Last week, Taiwanese business leader Kao urged China to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties.
But China was in no hurry to mend political fences, preferring instead to continue heaping pressure on Taiwan, said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""China is trying to use Taiwan's industrial and commercial sector to put pressure on the Taiwan authorities,"" he said.
Last month, China stepped up pressure on Taiwan to lift a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links between the two sides by unilaterally announcing a set of regulations for such links.
Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links since 1949. Indirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong.
Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.
Last month, China called for political talks with Taiwan to end the state of hostility to pave the way for reunification.
Both China and Taiwan agree to eventually reunify but on very different terms.
"
29,"Chinese Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin has wooed Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties to come up with constructive suggestions on reunification of the two sides, split by civil war almost five decades ago.
""We welcome Taiwan's various political parties...to exchange views with us on relations between the two sides and on constructive suggestions about peaceful reunification,"" Jiang told a government advisory body on New Year's Day.
Chinese newspapers carried the full text of Jiang's speech on Thursday.
Earlier this week, Jiang made a similar overture, but he made no mention of the island's political parties, instead referring to Taiwanese from all walks of life.
Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, which fled into exile on the island after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, says it is committed to reunification but is in no hurry to do so. Taiwan insists on reunification under freedom and democracy and a free market economy.
The island's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party has called for ""self-determination"", or letting Taiwan's residents decide for themselves whether to reunify or declare independence.
China, which regards Taiwan as a rebel province, has threatened to invade if the island declares independence.
""Taiwan is our country's sacred territory,"" Jiang said.
""We hope the Taiwanese authorities...will stop all activities splitting the motherland and take realistic action to improve relations between the two sides,"" he said.
Tensions between Beijing and Taipei began to ease in the late 1980s, but relations plunged after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a trip to the United States in a bid to break the island out of diplomatic isolation imposed by China.
Ties deteriorated further last March when China conducted war games and missile tests close to Taiwan in the run-up to the island's historic presidential elections. China frowns on Western-style democracy.
Analysts said Jiang was eager for reunification to secure his place in modern Chinese history alongside Mao Zedong, who established the People's Republic, and Deng Xiaoping, who cemented the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule in mid-1997.
Jiang, the anointed successor of Deng, China's 92-year-old paramount leader, is seen by some Western analysts as merely a transitional figure and he has struggled to shake off that image.
Jiang's call on Taiwan to come up with suggestions on ways to reunify could go unanswered again, one Chinese analyst said.
China has been bitter since Taiwan ignored Jiang's 1995 ""eight point"" proposal on reunification, in which he called for leaders of the two sides to exchange visits.
Jiang was seen by some in the military and the Communist Party as weak after his earlier call for reunification fell on deaf ears, analysts said.
His latest overture to Taiwan could backfire and be used by his political opponents to attack him, another analyst said.
"
29,"A Chinese court on Friday will consider the appeal of dissident Wang Dan against his 11-year sentence for plotting to overthrow the government, a hearing held days before a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
The Beijing Higher People's Court was widely expected to reject the 27-year-old dissident's appeal and uphold his conviction, Chinese lawyers said. In China, appellate courts rarely overturn rulings by lower courts.
Asked what the chances were of an acquittal, Wang's mother, Wang Lingyun, told Reuters on Thursday: ""I feel there's practically none. There is no precedent.""
Wang's appeal comes four days before the scheduled arrival of the U.S. secretary of state, who diplomats say was expected to raise human rights issues in his meetings with Chinese leaders during his November 19-21 visit.
Sino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from human rights to Taiwan to arms proliferation and trade.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a briefing on Thursday that Wang's trial had no bearing on Sino-U.S. relations because it involved a Chinese citizen and not an American.
Beijing has slammed Western criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.
Christopher would not be not alone in bringing up Beijing's shortcomings in human rights.
Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that harsh sentences slapped on Wang and Wei Jingsheng, widely known as the father of China's modern democracy movement, had caused dismay in the international community.
""The recent harsh sentences imposed on Mr Wei and Mr Wang have caused dismay in the wider world,"" Thatcher told a business conference in Beijing.
Last week, Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his misgivings over the jailing of Wang to his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng.
Wang's mother said court officials had told her that she would be able to attend her son's hearing as one of two defence lawyers, but she would not be allowed to speak. She has submitted a written defence.
The dissident's father and older sister would also be allowed to sit in on the hearing at the appellate court in Beijing, the mother said.
""If we don't go, Wang Dan would feel even more isolated. Our going is spiritual encouragement for him,"" the mother said.
The dissident's lawyer is unlikely to attend because only Wang would be allowed to speak.
The jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.
The lower court took less than four hours to convict and sentence Wang on October 30.
Wang had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life in 1989.
The New York-based Human Rights in China has denounced what it said was the ""secret trial"" of Wang on a trumped up charge.
China said it was an open and fair trial but Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend.
There has been no mention of Wang's conviction in the local Chinese-language media.
"
29,"China's parliament, eager to shed its rubber stamp image, has vowed to crack down on lawless officials by intensifying supervision of the government's executive and judicial branches.
Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress, had conceded that the problem of officials disregarding the law was very serious in some departments, major newspapers said on Friday.
""Some officials are not strict when implementing the law and do not investigate legal violations,"" Tian told the opening of a nine-day seminar in the booming southern city of Shenzhen on Thursday.
""These phenomena are very serious in some regions and departments,"" said Tian, a member of the ruling Communist Party's 19-member Politburo.
Official media frequently carry reports of abuse of power by local officials, who run their areas of jurisdiction as virtual fiefdoms. The word of an official is often taken as law.
""Some officials go as far as to replace the law with their word,"" Tian said. ""There are laws but some officials do not do things according to the law.
""Some use power to suppress the law, those enforcing the law break the law and some take the law into their own hands.""
Some Chinese analysts saw Tian's remarks as an attempt to increase the say of parliament in Chinese politics.
Tian and his mentor, Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress, who sits on the party's omnipotent seven-member Standing Committee, have moved in recent years to boost the status of parliament.
Tian urged lawmaking bodies at all levels to step up supervision of the executive and judicial branches.
""Supervision is a very weak link of the work of the People's Congress,"" Tian said.
He urged all lawmakers to conscientiously supervise trials and the work of the government, prosecutors and police.
Last month, a court took 10 minutes to reject the appeal of dissident and former student leader Wang Dan and uphold an 11-year jail term for conspiring to subvert the government.
Another dissident, Chen Longde, attempted suicide in August by jumping from a third-floor window because he could no longer stand beating by guards at a labour camp, his family has said.
The labour camp denies any wrongdoing.
Chen, who broke his right leg and smashed three teeth, has been discharged from hospital and sent back to the labour camp, where he is serving three years of re-education through labour for sending a petition to parliament demanding the release of all political prisoners.
Re-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by authorities without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.
Western human rights activists say the punishment is increasingly favoured by the authorities as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications and publicity of a trial.
"
29,"The mother of detained Chinese dissident Wang Dan said on Monday she would defend her son against the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government and that he was prepared for a heavy sentence.
""Two defence counsels are allowed...I will be one of them,"" Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old researcher at a museum who has no background in law, told Reuters in an interview.
""Wang Dan also wants me to defend him,"" she said. Chinese laws allow accused to be defended by family members.
A court spokeswoman confirmed Wang Dan, 26, had been charged with plotting to overthrow the government but declined to give further details.
Wang Dan's mother said the court had yet to inform her of the trial date, but said it could come as early as this week.
The dissident, detained without charge since May 1995, met his mother for the first time under police surveillance at a detention centre in Beijing, the Hong Kong-based Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
""Wang Dan...was very calm and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence,"" the group quoted the mother as saying. She added that she was worried about her son's health.
She told Reuters earlier that she would defend her son against the charge of collaborating with overseas subversive forces. ""This charge does not stand up,"" she said, adding that Wang Dan had only taken a correspondence course at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States.
""It has nothing to do with politics. I was the one who wanted him to attend the course...It has nothing to do with overthrowing the government,"" she said.
Asked to comment on the chances of winning the case, she said: ""I'm not optimistic. But I must say it for the record. This will become history.""
Relatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.
The lawyer retained by the family would defend the dissident against other charges in the indictment.
Wang Dan, former leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, has been charged with the capital offence of plotting to subvert the government, based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad.
He was detained by police in a raid on his home in May 1995, but was not formally arrested or charged until last week.
On Friday, the family obtained a copy of the bill of indictment, which accused Wang Dan of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death. The minimum sentence is 10 years, although the court can show leniency if it finds extenuating circumstances.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.
Wang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.
The court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people ""convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan"". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.
Wang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.
"
29,"Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan is to step down in a long-delayed reshuffle after the downfall of his mentor, the Chinese capital's disgraced Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, sources with close ties to the city government said on Sunday.
Li, 58, mayor of Beijing since 1993, would become a vice-minister of labour and could eventually replace Li Boyong, 62, as labour minister, said the sources who asked not to be identified. The two Lis are not related.
Li Qiyan's departure was widely expected after one of his vice-mayors came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide in April 1995.
The suicide shocked the nation and led to the downfall of Li's mentor, Chen Xitong, who has since disappeared from the public eye.
Chen resigned as Beijing's Communist Party boss and was later sacked from the Politburo, becoming the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the communists came to power in 1949.
Officials say Chen was himself still under investigation for possible wrongdoing.
The city government had been virtually paralysed since Chen's disgrace, the sources said.
""After Chen Xitong stepped down, the (city) government lost its credibility ... and could maintain only the most basic operation,"" one source told Reuters. ""It could not embark on huge projects ... It could not do anything.""
Li would be replaced by Jia Qinglin, 56, party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian, the sources said.
Jia arrived in Beijing last week to take up his new post as acting mayor, the sources said. Jia is expected to formally become the capital's mayor after his nomination is approved by the Beijing People's Congress.
In the run-up to the party's 15th congress next year, Jia could be promoted to Beijing's Communist Party secretary and land a seat in the party's powerful Politburo, they said.
The vice-mayor who committed suicide was found to have used his position to amass 116 houses illegally and build himself a villa on the outskirts of the city. He also masterminded a $37 million embezzlement and graft scam, officials have said.
Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.
Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus which threatened the party. Courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.
Earlier this month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou Beifang, former head of two publicly listed Hong Kong affiliates of a China steel giant, and two former officials of the Beijing city government.
The announcement of the charges against Zhou was among the first against one of China's so-called ""princelings"", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of the ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence.
Zhou, detained in February, 1995, is the son of Zhou Guanwu, former chairman and Communist Party secretary of Beijing's giant Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, also known as Shougang, and among the largest conglomerates in China.
"
29,"China began the trial of prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan on Wednesday on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, a court official said.
""The trial started at 9.00 a.m. (0100 GMT),"" said an official of the Beijing People's Intermediate Court reached by telephone. He declined to give further details.
Security was tight around the court building in western Beijing, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building and manning roadblocks to prevent access.
The father of the former student leader protested his son's innocence just hours before the start of the proceedings and said the family would not give in to the authorities.
""He is definitely innocent,"" Wang Xianzeng told reporters as he left his home with the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun, to go to the court. ""It just depends on whether the government wants to convict him or not.""
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.
""I'm not optimistic about the results,"" Wang Xianzeng said. ""We will definitely appeal... We will not give in.
""Speech can't overthrow the government,"" he said.
The court indictment against Wang, 27, includes the charge that his writings in foreign publications were evidence of his plot to try to overthrow the government.
He is also accused of accepting foreign funds, of colluding with subversives living overseas and of conspiring with domestic plotters to organise the overthrow of the government.
Wang Lingyun said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty.
The former student leader faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.
The mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he vanished into detention in May 1995.
She said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days. Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.
Human Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.
""The fact is that China's urban dissident movement...has in effect been comprehensively smashed,"" it said in a statement.
Wang's court appearance was expected to resemble the in-camera proceedings last December against Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
He was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.

29,"China's breakaway Catholic Church has ordained about 50 graduates of one of the country's biggest seminaries into the priesthood this year, clergy at the seminary said on Monday.
The new priests, five of whom were ordained on Sunday, were the first group of clergymen installed by the National Catholic Seminary since 1991, they said.
The officially authorised seminary in Beijing did not accept any new students for six years from 1986 due to a lack of funds and space, the clergymen said.
""It's a big problem. Funds are too limited,"" a priest surnamed Meng told Reuters by telephone.
The seminary receives 10,000 yuan ($1,200) a year from the government, or one-sixth of its annual budget, another priest said. It raises the rest from donations.
Father Meng, who graduated in 1991, said there was no shortage of youths, many of them poor, who wanted to become priests.
He and other priests denied that government pressure had played a role in the lack of new students between 1986 and 1991.
Catholics in communist China are allowed to worship openly only if they belong to the state-sponsored Catholic Patriotic Association.
The association, which supervises the national seminary, appoints its own bishops and does not recognise the Pope as universal Catholic leader.
The official church has the blessings of the Communist Party but it too must walk a fine line between the demands of the party elite and the needs of the faithful.
The Washington-based Human Rights Watch/Asia has said Beijing has been stepping up harassment of unauthorised Catholic and Protestant groups in recent years.
The group said the crackdown on Christians included stricter controls on contacts with foreigners and was part of a broader drive begun in 1994 against all forms of religion as well as political dissent.
Bishop Zong Huaide of the state-backed church ordained five graduates of the seminary on Sunday. Zong delivered mass at the Church of the Holy Saviour, built in 1703, which was packed with about 3,000 people.
China has 31 seminaries and about 1,100 priests, 700 of whom are state-anointed young men.
The official Catholic Church in China counts four million members, while the underground church is believed to have several million members.
Vatican relations with Beijing have alternately cooled and warmed over the decades since the late 1950s, when links were severed over the Vatican's recognition of Taiwan.
China has said it will not normalise relations until the Vatican severs its ties with Taiwan, which Beijing has regarded as a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
The Vatican, on the other hand, has demanded recognition of the Pope's primacy before it renews ties with China.

29,"Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has filed a lawsuit against Beijing authorities for sending him to a labour camp without trial, his wife said on Tuesday.
Liu urged Beijing's Xuanwu District Court to overturn a decision by the Beijing Re-education through Labour Committee to send him to a labour camp for three years.
""I refuse to accept the decision,"" Liu said in his suit, a copy of which was made available to Reuters.
""I am appealing...not out of fear of losing freedom...but to defend my right to freedom of speech as a law-abiding citizen,"" the 41-year-old dissident said.
Police detained Liu, a renowned literary critic and prominent dissident, in September and sent him to a camp in the northeastern city of Dalian to serve three years of re-education through labour.
Re-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by authorities while avoiding the court system.
Western human rights activists say re-education through labour is increasingly favoured as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications or publicity of a trial.
The dissident's wife, Liu Xia, told Reuters that the court had agreed to hear the suit though no date had been set.
Court officials declined to comment.
Authorities at the labour camp had rejected requests by Liu's family to visit him, his wife said.
""They (authorities) told his father that his performance was not good,"" Liu's wife said in an interview.
She said she held little hope of winning the suit.
The Re-education through Labour Committee accused Liu Xiaobo of ""concocting stories, distorting facts, libelling and sullying the government, stirring up trouble and disturbing social order"".
It said the alleged offences were committed in a petition to the government and a newspaper article written by Liu for a Taiwan newspaper.
In the government petition made last year, Liu and dozens of other intellectuals urged the government to reassess the June 1989 military crackdown on student-led demonstrations for democracy.
""Liu...was warned several times but was unrepentant and continued to engage in lawbreaking and criminal activities,"" said a document issued by the committee.
In the months before his incarceration, Liu orchestrated several daring, open letters to the government.
On September 30, Liu and another dissident, Wang Xizhe, issued a statement calling for the indictment and impeachment of Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin.
The pair demanded Jiang's resignation for violating the constitution for saying the People's Liberation Army was under the ""absolute leadership"" of the party instead of the state.
Wang fled to the United States in October.
Last week, Beijing's Chaoyang District Court rejected the lawsuit of another dissident, Liu Nianchun, against a similar labour camp term.
China dismisses international criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.
Chinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the tiny democracy movement in recent months. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are in prison or labour camp.

29,"China on Thursday savoured its latest victory in a diplomatic tug-of-war with Taiwan, while the stunned island scrambled to limit the damage from South Africa's decision to abandon it.
South African President Nelson Mandela said in Johannesburg on Wednesday that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997.
Beijing hailed the move, saying it was in South Africa's interest.
""We ...welcome President Mandela's positive statement concerning normalisation of relations between China and South Africa,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing in Beijing.
""If South Africa can recognise reality at an earlier date it is in its own interest to do so,"" Cui said.
Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation. Taiwan insists its 21 million people should have a voice in international affairs.
South Africa is the biggest of just 30 states that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China rather than the communist People's Republic on the mainland.
The Chinese government spokesman said the People's Republic was the sole, legitimate government of all China.
""South Africa must recognise there is only one China, recognise that Taiwan is a part of China and sever so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan,"" Cui said.
Wealthy but diplomatically isolated Taiwan was stunned by Mandela's announcement and scrambled to limit the damage by urging its 29 other allies not to be swayed by China.
""We hope such a situation won't affect our diplomatic relations with other countries...,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister John Chang said in a televised news conference in Taipei.
""We will actively negotiate with South Africa in the next 12 months,"" Chang said, adding that he might visit South Africa before an official visit scheduled for January.
South Africa's Ambassador to Taiwan Johannes Viljoen urged the island not to exact reprisals against Pretoria.
But Taiwan's top economic planner said the island would not continue to encourage investment in South Africa.
Tuntex, one of the island's major business groups, said earlier on Thursday it would respect the government's wishes in deciding whether to move ahead with a planned $3 billion petrochemical project in South Africa.
Taiwan officials said they would conduct an overall review of Taiwanese investments in South Africa, currently totalling over $1.5 billion.
South Africa's decision to switch ties to China sent Taiwan stocks into a brief dive, but the market had recovered by the close. Many businesssmen played down any potential for serious, long-term harm.
The Taiwan dollar closed little changed against its U.S. counterpart despite news of the island's diplomatic setback.
Taiwanese officials blamed China for South Africa's decision to ditch Taiwan, saying China was ""buying"" foreign ties and damaging chances for reunification between the longtime rivals.
There were no protests at Pretoria's embassy in Taipei, contrasting with the public outrage displayed in previous years after Washington, Seoul and other former allies dropped Taipei for Beijing.

27,"Faced with persistent market rumours that it is on the verge of collapse, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd went public on Wednesday to say that any such talk is ""totally groundless"".
""In the markets, unsourced rumours such as the suggestion that our bank is practically on the verge of collapse are circulating and are prompting sales of our shares and debentures,"" NCB vice president Shoji Nishikawa told a hastily convened news conference.
""Such rumours are totally groundless and our bank would like to declare that these rumours are not true,"" he said.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka also came out in support of long-suffering Nippon Credit, whose failure could spark a crisis in the banking industry.
He said the government will fully support the bank, although he added that the ministry is not worried about the financial health of Nippon Credit, the smallest of the nation's three long-term credit banks.
""The ministry has had no worries about the bank. It (the bank) is doing its utmost to improve its management. We don't believe that the bank will collapse as some media reports have said,"" Mitsuzuka told reporters at his regular news conference.
Nippon Credit's latest ordeal began early Wednesday when traders began to sell its shares on vague talk that NCB would hold an emergency news conference. There was also a vague rumour about a possible merger involving NCB, they said.
The dumping of the bank's shares ignited renewed selling throughout the banking sector. The sharp fall in banking shares has been largely to blame for the tumble in the Tokyo stock market since mid-December.
Nippon Credit shares fell 35 yen (28 cents) to close on Wednesday at an all-time low of 181 yen ($1.47).
In the bond market, NCB's latest debentures are selling at a yield of 4.1 percent, a full 2.5 percentage points above bonds issued by other banks, reflecting the perceived risk in its debts.
Nishikawa said the sell-off was influenced by exaggerated media reports which hyped concerns over the health of Japan's financial system.
""We believe the market condition has deviated greatly from the realities of the bank. We hope market participants will calm down,"" he said.
He also said the bank would be able to post a current profit in 1996/97 even after disposing of problem loans as it had planned -- if Tokyo stock prices remain at their current levels.
Like other banks, NCB relies on its own share holdings to help provide needed cash so as the stock market tumbles, its situation worsens. That has created a vicious circle for the Tokyo stock market.
The bank plans to write off problem loans of 130 billion yen ($1.05 billion) in the current fiscal year ending March 31. As of the end of September, such problem loans totalled 1.39 trillion yen ($11.3 billion).
Some analysts said that it is unclear whether the news conference by NCB and the finance ministry's pledge to support the bank would help regain confidence in Japan's banking sector.
""In the long-term, the banking sector will remain under pressure until Japan completes its 'Big Bang' financial reforms,"" said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre. ($1=123 yen)

27,"Japan is expected to lift controls on stock-related derivatives as part of a drive to free up its financial markets, but industry sources have doubts about whether the products can really take off here.
The securities industry sources said Tokyo was lagging so far behind overseas rivals, including Singapore and Hong Kong, that it would be extremely difficult to make a viable and attractive market for stock-based derivatives in Japan.
On Monday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a five-year ""Big Bang"" plan to liberalise the nation's markets and catch up with reforms carried out years ago in rival financial centres like London. The aim is to make Japanese markets ""free, fair and global"".
As part of that push, Hashimoto asked for a review of laws relating to derivatives transaction, which currently restrict stock options to those based on indices, rather than on individual stocks.
But even before the ""Big Bang"" announcement, Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) had already been looking at lifting restrictions on stock options and equity swap transactions.
A trader at a foreign brokerage said that Japanese participants are already used to offshore trading in derivatives, avoiding the tightly regulated Japanese markets, and it may be hard to generate interest here.
""It is too late to induce market enthusiasm,"" he said. ""Even if the finance ministry deregulates (stock-related) derivatives trading in Japan, it might be difficult to make Tokyo markets attractive,"" he said.
An official at the ministry told Reuters recently that it plans to decide whether to allow the introduction of a variety of stock-related derivatives transactions after an advisory panel delivers its recommendations next spring.
While Japan introduced stock index futures and options in the late 1980s, the ministry has taken a particularly cautious approach to derivatives of individual stocks in order to concentrate equity-related deals on stock exchanges.
Options, which are usually used to hedge against losses due to price fluctuations, allow the holder to buy or sell a specified amount at an agreed price during a set time period.
An analyst at a big brokerage said that the securities industry and the Osaka and Tokyo stock exchanges have made preparations to list individual stock options and are ready to start as soon as the ministry gives the go-ahead.
Such options on individual stocks were introduced in the early 1970s in the U.S. and European markets.
Big Japanese brokers also want to offer stock options which can be traded directly between investors and traders without any stock exchange involvement, he said.
Up until now, trading of individual stock options and equity swap transactions was banned as this was judged to violate the Criminal Code outlawing gambling.
This has pushed lucrative business offshore to less regulated markets, where brokers are able to trade options or warrants based on Japanese stocks if they wish. Market sources say Japan may have to revise the law to clear the way for such derivatives trade.

27,"One year after the peak of Japan's banking crisis, financial institutions are still reeling from the shock, and some have not escaped bankruptcy, analysts say.
Bankers say the worst of the bad loan nightmare is over, but analysts believe Japan's financial industry remains vulnerable.
""It will take some time for confidence in Japanese banks to be restored -- at least until real estate transactions are reactivated,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International.
Bad loans largely take the form of land collateral.
""Even for big banks, it will take a few years to write off most problem loans and this will hurt their earnings,"" he said.
Financial analyst Hideichiro Nishimura at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics said that despite vigorous efforts by the government and banks to clear the bad loan mess in the past year, confidence in Japanese financial institutions has not improved in international markets.
Currently stable share prices and low interest rates are helping banks dispose of problem loans steadily and on schedule, but their efforts to restructure operations still fall short of boosting their declining asset quality, he said.
August 30 last year saw Japan's first bank failure since World War Two. The financial system was jolted as major regional bank Hyogo Bank and the country's biggest credit union, Kizu Shinyo Kumiai, collapsed due to adventurous lending during the ""bubble economy"" of the late 1980s.
Ahead of that dark day, the biggest credit union in Tokyo, Cosmo Shinyo Kumiai, had collapsed, and then this year, second-tier regional bank Taiheiyo Bank went under.
Several analysts expect more bank failures.
""Everyone knows what has to happen (more financial failures), but no one knows when and how and who pays,"" an analyst at a foreign securities firm said.
To dispose of 10.7 trillion yen ($99.0 billion) of loan losses, many of Japan's biggest banks posted net losses in the fiscal 1995/96, ended March 31.
But counting all deposit-taking institutions, on that date there were still 8.3 trillion yen ($76.8 billion) of loan losses which need to be written off, the Finance Ministry said.
In June, parliament passed bills to clean up the nation's bad loan mess and deal with bank failures, along with a scheme to wind up failed mortgage firms, using taxpayers' money.
Analysts are cool about such efforts, however.
A spokeswoman at international credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service said it has not much changed its BFSR (bank financial strength rating) since August last year, when it unveiled the BFSR for major Japanese banks for the first time.
Moody's last week warned that some of Japan's seven major trust banks may need external support in order to survive growing competition and the burden of bad debts.
Moody's gave Chuo Trust &amp; Banking and Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking an ""E"" ranking, meaning that they suffer from very weak intrinsic financial strength, and gave only a slightly better ""E+"" rating to Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking and Nippon Trust Bank.
It also kept Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Nippon Credit Bank at the ""E"" it gave them last August.
""We expect banks with very weak financial fundamentals to ultimately require assistance either from the authorities or from their respective corporate group members,"" Moody's said.

27,"The latest scandal at Nomura Securities has seriously damaged the industry's image and the brokerage will be hard-pressed to convince investors it can clean up its act, analysts and market sources say.
In the latest development, the California Public Employees' Retirement Fund said on Tuesday it was suspending business with Nomura. The action came in the wake of a scandal over illicit transactions that could be linked with corporate racketeers.
The fund said, however, that it did not plan to take legal action against Nomura.
Sources close to the company say Nomura, rocked by its second major scandal in six years, will likely unveil a programme at the urging of the Finance Ministry to avoid a recurrence of such shady backroom deals.
The steps are expected to include the establishment of a compliance committee made up of senior management, the sources said. They also said Nomura's senior executives will accept salary cuts to atone for the scandal, in addition to president Hideo Sakamaki's resignation last Friday.
But analysts said Japan's top brokerage was responsible for a grave loss of investor confidence in the ethics of the securities industry as a whole.
The revelations about improper movements of funds between accounts raise fears that profits made in customers' accounts may be moved to brokers' own accounts, destroying the trust between investors and brokerages, they said.
Nomura said on March 6 that two of its directors, who have since resigned, had made discretionary transactions with a corporate client and transferred profits from Nomura's own account to the client's account.
Japanese media have said the corporate client was a relative of a one-time racketeer, but Nomura said it could not confirm the identity of the client.
Japanese newspaper and television reports have said Nomura had obtained profits worth about 40 million yen ($325,000) from trading in shares of Fuji Bank Ltd that it funnelled to the client's account on March 15, 1995.
A spokesman for Nomura declined to comment on the reports.
But Kazumasa Niimi, a senior economist at the Japan Research Institute, said if the reports were true, it raised questions over whether Fuji's share price was affected by Nomura's trading.
He said the volume of trading in bank shares is generally small, meaning trades of that size could influence the market price.
While the investigation is still under way with no charges made, industry sources said the transactions may have violated securities laws banning stock price manipulation.
Industry sources say the investigation is also looking into whether Nomura transferred profits from the brokerage's own account to that of a favoured client and made discretionary transactions without a client's consent.
Nomura sources also said the deals in question were on handwritten order forms, which would be easier to alter than computer printouts usually used to keep a record of transactions.
If the profits are then revealed to have been funnelled to a racketeer, this would also violate the commercial code, they said.
Corporate racketeers, called ""sokaiya"", extort money from companies by threatening to disturb shareholders' meetings or by offering to prevent disruption of the proceedings. Japanese commercial law has banned such payoffs since 1992.
Nomura has remained silent on the repercussions of the scandal since its president's resignation on Friday, saying it cannot comment as the matter is under investigation.
It will hold a regular board of directors' meeting on Wednesday, but a spokesman said the topics for discussion have not yet been decided.
A government source told Reuters last week that the probe by Japan's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, or SESC, is likely to take some time.
""In order to complete the investigation as soon as possible, an extraordinary amount of cooperation is needed from Nomura,"" he said.
He added that until recently, Nomura was not as cooperative as the authorities might have hoped.
In the last major scandal to rock Nomura, in 1991, two senior executives resigned from the board over revelations that the brokerage had compensated favoured clients for losses and that affiliates had dealt with gangsters. ($1=123 yen)
"
27,"Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided the country's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, in a dramatic sign of a widening probe into payments to a client linked to racketeers.
The late afternoon raid on Nomura headquarters in central Tokyo was by both prosecutors and officials of the nation's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC).
The highly public raids, preceded by tipoffs to the media that they were imminent, appeared to signal that the action against Nomura could become a showcase as Japan seeks to clean up business practices and deregulate its economy.
Coinciding with the headquarters raid, another 90 officials swooped on 10 other locations and for the first time formally spelled out the suspicions in detail.
Deputy chief prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters the raids were to investigate a Nomura director's illegal payment of 38 million yen ($309,000) to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting.
Matsuo said the other raids included searches of the homes of the racketeer or ""sokaiya"" and the Nomura director involved in the scandal, Shimpei Matsuki.
The scandal surfaced on March 6 and Matsuki and fellow director Nobutaka Fujikura resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer.
Sokaiya, often linked to ""yakuza"" crime syndicates, extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called ""sokai"" in Japanese.
Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down on March 14 to atone for the scandal. He became an adviser to the company, and chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship.
Nomura, one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, is involved in bond and share trading.
It exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan's top foreign bond seller.
The company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke.
Nomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century, underwriting firms such as Sony Corp, which were part of Japan's postwar economic miracle.
In a scene akin to a Japanese film, 90 officials in business suits, led by a man with a briefcase, marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura's modernistic headquarters.
They firmly locked the doors, shutting out journalists gathered for a raid designed to have maximum publicity value.
Reports that the raids were imminent hit Nomura's share price, which ended the day down 20 yen (16 cents) at 1,440 ($11.70).
But brokers said the impact of the news was limited as the market had expected such a development.
""What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage,"" said Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager.
""The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well,"" Ueki said.
The investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients.
Top executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.

27,"Japan's depressed real estate market is unlikely to get much immediate help for its problems despite market euphoria over possible state purchases of land once owned by troubled financial firms, analysts said.
Tokyo's key stock index surged on Thursday, led by property-related issues, after a newspaper report saying the government was considering using public funds to buy collateralised land formerly owned by failed mortgage firms and other troubled financial firms.
The index, the Nikkei 225, ended up 2.43 percent at 19,051.71, its first close above 19,000 points for more than a month.
A Finance Ministry official told Reuters a government panel was considering using funds already set aside in the next state budget to buy land formerly owned by troubled financial firms.
Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa later confirmed the possibility, telling a news conference it was possible public-sector firms may purchase such land.
He said the plan would help ease the liquidity crisis affecting real estate.
A government panel, whose members include officials from the ministries of finance, construction and justice and the National Land Agency, was set up last October to tackle the tough issue of collecting problem loans for which land is being held as collateral.
At present, firms cannot afford to sell at market levels since they would realise their huge losses caused by the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy early this decade.
This has led to stagnation in the real estate market and kept the massive problem hanging over the whole financial sector.
""The panel has been discussing how to increase liquidity in the real estate market to facilitate collection of such problem loans,"" said an official at a bank involved in the discussions.
""But we have not talked about any details yet.""
However, he said that if the government decided to buy such collateralised land, it would have a positive impact since the private sector remained reluctant to buy land.
Jesper Koll, an economist at JP Morgan Securities Asia, said public land buying was not a new initiative and no new funds were likely to be allocated for the purchases.
However, he said that more important than any public purchases was Hashimoto's promise to speed up the process of turning real estate into equity assets.
""The faster banks and real estate companies are allowed to securitise property assets, the greater their prospects for increased income generation,"" he said. ""Prime Minister Hashimoto is getting serious about fixing Japan's real estate problem sooner, not later.""
Yoshinobu Yamada, a financial analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said that while the move by the government panel on land was not a new initiative, it would have a positive impact in the long-term.
""The government is well aware that it must take steps to stop falling land prices,"" he said, adding that a lack of land liquidity was at the core of Japan's bad-loan mess.
""If the government buys collateralised land formerly owned by jusen, this is likely to give psychological support to the the real estate markets and help the markets bottom out.""
However, he said no concrete policy steps would be available until March so that the current euphoria on the Tokyo's stock market could be only a passing fancy.

27,"Two out of Japan's ""Big Four"" brokers, Nomura Securities and Daiwa Securities, are expected to regain their financial health in the current business year, analysts said on Friday.
Japan's second-biggest broker Daiwa Securities said on Friday that it was considering a restructuring programme for a non-bank affiliate.
While details have yet to be decided, analysts said it would not be surprising if Daiwa announces financial aid later in the 1996/97 business year ending in March.
""We expect Daiwa to post a parent current profit of 67 billion yen ($598 million) in 1996/97 if daily average turnover on the Tokyo exchange hits 430 billion yen ($3.83 billion) and if it does not give any support,"" said Ayako Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities.
Problem loans held by Daiwa's non-bank affiliate are estimated to total 100 billion yen ($892 million) to 150 billion yen ($1.33 billion), and even if the broker decides to help its affiliate write off problem loans in 1996/97, it would have no major impact on Daiwa's financial health, she said.
The ""Big Four"", including Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, are scheduled to announce their business results on Tuesday for the first half of the fiscal year to September 30.
Japanese business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on Friday that Daiwa was likely to post flat parent net profits in 1996/97 as it has basically decided to provide financial support of about 100 billion yen ($892 million) to a non-bank affiliate.
Daiwa was expected to post a parent current profit of 50 billion yen ($446 million) for 1996/97 and an extraordinary profit of about 50 billion yen ($446 million) from sales of shares, offsetting the special loss stemming from the financial support, the paper said.
In the year ended March 31, 1996, Daiwa posted a parent net profit of 43.69 billion yen ($390 million).
The broker did not issue a profit forecast.
Last month, Nomura said it would provide financial support to its ailing affiliate and post a special loss of 371 billion yen ($3.31 billion) in the half year to September 30.
Nomura said it would post a net loss for the first half because of the special loss, but declined to give an earnings forecast for the half-year and the full year.
However, analysts were unsure whether the other two, Nikko and Yamaichi, which face similar financial problems at their non-bank affiliates, would take action in 1996/97.
A Nikko spokesman said on Friday that the company was considering measures to help its financial affiliates, but no decision had been made.
Ryuji Shirai, deputy president at Yamaichi Securities, said earlier this month that the firm has been reviewing the 10-year programme it launched three years ago to help restructure its non-bank affiliate, and may shorten that period.
UBS's Sato said that it may be difficult for Nikko to quickly decide any course of action for its non-bank affiliates as one of Nikko group's non-bank affiliates is jointly owned by Asahi Bank and its group companies.
Yamaichi's relatively weak capital base compared with the three other big brokers may make it difficult to provide financial aid to its non-bank affiliate in 1996/97, analysts also said.
Nikko projected a parent net profit of nine billion yen ($80.3 million) for the first half and 24 billion yen ($214 million) for the full 1996/97 year.
Yamaichi expected a parent net profit for the half-year of five billion yen ($44.6 million) and for the full year of 16 billion yen ($142 million). ($1=112 yen)

27,"Losses have mounted in a stock market slump that has dragged on for years, yet Japanese securities brokers still cling on.
But expected liberalisation of brokerage fees could be the final blow for some of the weaker securities houses.
Analysts and industry sources say small Japanese brokers are seriously considering closing down amid fears of a plunge in revenues from commission fees, and foreign brokerages are taking a more positive look at the advantages of acquiring local brokers.
""The number of Japanese brokers will likely fall to half the current level over the next five to 10 years,"" an official at a Japanese securities house said. ""Many small brokerages are likely to close down or to be liquidated.""
As seen in Europe and North America, some analysts say revenues from commission fees will fall by at least 30 percent within one or two years of deregulation, while others say they could fall by half within the initial year.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a five-year ""Big Bang"" plan last November to enable Japan to catch up with reforms carried out a decade ago in Europe and North America.
Japan will finalise procedures next month to implement the reforms, which include the timing of liberalising commissions and breaking down barriers between financial sectors. They may also include abolishing a system under which brokers must operate under licences granted by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), analysts say.
No Japanese brokers have voluntarily closed and handed back their licences to MOF since the licence system began in 1968.
But such moves are now in sight.
Industry sources say a small broker based in Osaka, Ogawa Securities Co Ltd, an affiliate of Yamaichi Securities, could be the first to go into voluntary liquidation, as Yamaichi may not give it financial aid.
Ogawa said last Thursday it had no plans at present to stop doing business. Yamaichi, meanwhile, says it is considering how it will deal with Ogawa's difficulties.
There are about 285 brokerages in Japan including 56 foreign firms, but only 25 brokers, all Japanese, are listed.
A senior MOF official told Reuters the ministry would accept voluntary liquidation by brokers. He added that brokerage fees should be liberalised in the final stages of the ""Big Bang"" process after other areas of the securities business have been deregulated.
""We are well aware that local brokers would face difficulties unless they are given a certain period of time to prepare for the liberalisation of brokering fees,"" he said.
Indeed, the financial strength of domestic brokers has deteriorated since the bursting of the late 1980s ""bubble"" of inflated asset prices.
Last month, the Big Four -- Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi -- and one of Japan's 10 second-tier brokerages, Kokusai Securities, announced parent current profits for 1996/97, ended March 31.
But the other nine second-tier brokers all said they expected parent current losses for 1996/97 due to stock price falls. They will announce their earnings figures this week.
Among the nine, Dai-Ichi Securities and Yamatane Securities said they would be reporting current losses for the seventh consecutive year.
Analysts say many of the second-tier brokers, which depend on stock commission fees for 50 to 60 percent of their revenues, are likely to eventually be acquired by big banks.
They also say medium-sized brokers face more urgent restructuring moves this year, such as mergers and seeking outside capital, because by law they must raise minimum capital reserves by the end of next March.
Meanwhile, one analyst said foreign brokerages and non-financial Japanese firms had begun seriously studying the possibility of taking over local brokers. ""Foreign securities houses are keen to strengthen underwriting and asset management businesses and they want to have more networks to do so.""
One solution for foreign brokerages worried whether they can cut payrolls to boost efficiency would be to increase the number of people working on a commission basis, he said.
""Japanese brokerages are now cheap. Even among second-tier brokerages, there are some firms you can buy for about 30 billion yen ($252 million),"" he said. ($1=119 yen)
"
27,"The Tokyo stock market's recent falls offer a preview of the pain Japan's life insurance industry will face as a result of greater competition from planned ""Big Bang"" financial reforms, industry sources say.
The fall in share prices means some of the insurance companies may have to post losses in the business year to March 31, increasing an already wide gap in financial strength between big and small firms, the sources said.
But the real threat is expected intense competition from other financial sectors such as banking after the Big Bang.
""The Big Bang is the real threat, as it means fierce competition among all financial sectors, including banks and Western asset management firms,"" said an executive at a major life insurance firm.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto unveiled plans in November to liberalise Japan's financial markets by 2001 under the Big Bang reforms, in which banks, brokers and insurance companies will be allowed to enter each other's turf.
In the past, Japan's life insurance industry enjoyed spectacular growth as the nation's economic success enabled people to plan for the long-term financial security of their families, analysts said.
But with the maturing of the core life insurance product market, big insurers are focusing on asset management.
The life insurers are already facing increased competition after a revision to the law governing them allowed 11 non-life insurers to set up life insurance subsidiaries last October, raising to 44 the number of life insurers in Japan.
A spokesman for Sony Life Insurance, a subsidiary of Sony Corp, said there were also concerns about how far the big commercial banks would be permitted to enter the insurance business under the Big Bang reforms.
Koya Hasegawa, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said the life insurance industry needed to increase its efficiency, particularly to fight off a challenge from the banks.
The reforms are expected to allow over-the-counter sales of insurance policies by banks, he said.
But even before that, some life insurers are in for a tough time. ""If stocks remain under pressure until the end of the current business year they will see unrealised profits on their shareholdings wiped out, forcing them to post losses,"" Nikko Research's Hasegawa said.
Falling stock prices reduce their unrealised profits on shareholdings. These unrealised profits are a source of funds to cover sudden losses and write-offs of problem loans and make up for negative spreads between low investment yields and already promised payouts.
The payouts are calculated based on prospective investment yields at the time insurance policies were written.
If the Nikkei average of 225 leading shares is around 19,000 on March 31, when the companies close their books for 1996/97, unrealised profits on shareholdings at three life insurers -- Toho Mutual Life, Nissan Mutual Life and Kyoei Life -- will be wiped out, the sources said.
A Nikkei fall to 18,000 would make the unrealised profits at Tokyo Mutual Life, Nippon Dantai Life and Daihyaku Mutual Life disappear, while the crucial level is 17,000 for Sumitomo Life and Chiyoda Mutual Life, they said.
On Thursday, the Nikkei closed down 471.26 points at 17,864.04. But on Friday morning the index bounced back, rising 570.68 points by midday.
Chiyoda, Nissan, Kyoei, Tokyo, Nippon Dantai, and Daihyaku all posted before-tax current losses in the year to March 31, 1995. Toho also did so, for the second straight year.

27,"Punitive actions by Japan's Finance Ministry against scandal-tainted Nomura Securities Co Ltd are unlikely for some time, even if Japan's securities watchdog files a complaint against Nomura this week with prosecutors, government sources said on Monday.
""The SESC (the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission) usually recommends punitive action to the Finance Minister after prosecutors complete their investigation of a case and decide whether to issue an indictment or not,"" one source said.
How long it takes prosecutors to complete their investigation is expected to depend on how far they intend to pursue the case, he added.
Over the weekend, Japanese newspapers reported that the SESC plans to file a complaint this week with prosecutors against former Nomura executives and against Nomura itself, after which Tokyo prosecutors plan to launch a full-scale investigation of the Nomura scandal.
Comment was not available from the SESC on Monday.
Since late March, prosecutors and the SESC have been investigating Nomura's role in suspected illegal payments to a corporate client linked to a ""sokaiya"" racketeer.
Government sources said that Nomura is suspected of violating the Securities and Exchange Law, by illegally using discretionary stock dealings to compensate the corporate client for stock trading losses, and the Commercial Code, by indirectly offering profits to the sokaiya.
""Sokaiya"" extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting or by offering to prevent a disruption of the proceedings by shareholders critical of the company. Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to such racketeers since 1982.
By way of example, financial sources noted the case of a smaller brokerage, Chiyoda Securities Co Ltd, that was ordered by MOF in mid-March, 1996 to suspend some of its business.
The SESC had first asked prosecutors to bring criminal charges against Chiyoda as early as December 1995.
The SESC waited until Chiyoda itself and five executives were indicted in February, 1996, however, before making a proposal to MOF on penalising the brokerage.
Media reports in recent days suggested that the scope of the Nomura scandal was widening.
The Mainichi Shimbun reported on Monday that there were more than 20 Nomura accounts linked to ""sokaiya"" racketeers in 1995, not including the racketeer at the centre of the current scandal.
Nomura declined to comment, stating that the company views the Mainichi report as linked to the current incident under investigation by Japanese regulators. He also said that the company could not comment on accounts of its customers.
Mainichi said those accounts were opened at Nomura before 1991, when the brokerage was hit by a scandal involving improper payment of compensation for preferred customers' losses and revelations of deals between its affiliates and gangsters.
Mainichi quoted unnamed sources as saying that, after the 1991 scandal, Nomura cancelled accounts of problematic clients but it could not cut its relationship with racketeers.
It also quoted a former Nomura executive saying that Nomura transferred profits from trading on its own account to those racketeer-linked accounts, due to its desire to avoid any troubles at its annual shareholders' meetings, it said.
In the past month Japanese media have also reported that Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB) made loans to the corporate client to help the sokaiya secure 300,000 Nomura shares in 1989, which gave him the right to propose the dismissal of executives at shareholders' meetings.
The newspapers have also said that prosecutors are investigating DKB loans for a possible link between the racketeer and the bank.
DKB repeatedly declined to comment on the reported loans.

5,"Expertise ranging from snack packaging design to nuclear waste disposal and the destruction of chemical weapons was put up for sale Monday as the UK government embarked on what may be its last privatisation venture, the sale of AEA Technology Plc.
Trade and industry secretary Ian Lang will be hoping to swell Treasury coffers by around 200 million pounds ($312.7 million) through the disposal of 100 per cent of the Oxfordshire-based group, which is a spin-off from the Atomic Energy Authority, at the end of September.
With a general election looming the sale immediately ran into a political row over the government's decision to keep its ""golden share"" in AEA Technology, allowing it to veto an unwelcome takeover attempt, for just three years.
The opposition Labour Party cited ""security implications"" over AEA Technology's role in monitoring UK nuclear submarine safety, and sources told Reuters that Labour will consider extending the veto if it wins power.
At a distinctly low-tech launch for the pathfinder prospectus, AEA Technology chief executive Peter Watson shrugged off the embarrassment of a malfunctioning slide projector to explain that the group ""is all about taking technology to market and converting science to profit.""
Watson could easily have a sign on his desk reading ""no job is too big or too small"" for AEA Technology, whose interests have spread far beyond the state-owned nuclear industry which spawned it in the 1940s.
Work such as decommissioning nuclear plants and offering safety expertise worldwide, including at the site of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine, accounted for just over half its 253.3 million stg of sales in the year to March.
But Watson is keen to stress success in using the group's 3,500 employees to solve a plethora of scientific conundrums, including doubling the life of batteries for Sony Corp mobile phones, helping Subaru win the World Rally Championship  and assisting the U.S. with the destruction of chemical weapons.
""And we are helping a client to research an improved crisp (potato chip) packet,"" Watson added.
AEA Technology hopes to persuade would-be investors, expected to be institutions rather than the army of small investors which bought into the likes of British Gas Plc and British Telecom Plc, that sales growth is about to take off after three static years, which it attributes to a drop in reliance on government contracts.
With most cost-cutting behind it, Watson told Reuters he wants to lift foreign sales to one-third of the total from just over one-fifth and take advantage of a growing trend for major companies like SmithKline Beecham Plc to outsource research to help drive pretax profit up from the 15.8 million pounds seen in the year to March.

5,"Promising trial results published on Wednesday on a new drug for treating Hepatitis B have raised hopes that Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc may have another big seller on its hands.
The pharmaceuticals giant, whose best-selling ulcer drug Zantac is expected to be eaten up by generic competition later this year, said advanced studies showed that Lamivudine may reduce and even reverse damage to the liver caused by the Hepatitis B virus.
Shares in Glaxo Wellcome, which licensed Lamivudine from Canada's BioChem Pharma Inc in 1990, climbed 23 1/2 pence to 11.13 pounds ($18.04) in early afternoon trading.
Lamivudine is also the base for Glaxo Wellcome's increasingly successful AIDS drug Epivir. But analysts said questions remained about how effective Lamivudine would be with Hepatitis B, with detailed results from several other studies not expected until the end of the year.
However, any advance would be a breakthrough against a virus which doctors say is 100 times more infectious than AIDS and kills two million people every year.
The World Health Organisation estimates that 350 million people carry the virus worldwide. Passed on in a variety of ways including unprotected sex, drug use, contact sports and from mother to baby, it can lead to severe liver scarring and is responsible for 80 percent of cases of liver cancer.
In a ground-breaking move Glaxo Wellcome plans to file its first regulatory approval for the drug in Asia later this year rather than in Europe or the United States, reflecting the prevalence of Hepatitis B in the region.
Glaxo Wellcome told the European Association for the Study of the Liver on Wednesday that phase III tests of Lamivudine on 358 people with chronic Hepatitis B in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong were ""extremely encouraging"".
It said 67 percent of patients who took a 100 milligram Lamivudine tablet every day for a year saw the condition of their liver improve compared with 30 percent who took a placebo. The number of people whose liver deteriorated was greatly reduced.
It also found that 16 percent of people taking the drug managed to stop the Hepatitis B virus from replicating in the blood compared with four percent who took a placebo.
More than 95 percent of Hepatitis B cases are estimated to be in the developing world. Authorities in China said last year that 120 million Chinese were affected by the condition and about 40 percent of these were pregnant women. Glaxo Wellcome said it had already held talks with the Chinese government on making the drug available there.
A spokesman said Lamivudine would also fit in with the group's strategy of becoming more focused on different regions, partly in recognition of the huge growth potential for pharmaceuticals and health care in regions such as Asia and South America.
But analysts said Lamivudine's focus on poorer countries made the issue of pricing the drug difficult to predict. It also raised the question of creating different pricing policies for rich and poor countries, a controversial move which Glaxo Wellcome is known to want to explore.
One analyst said sales estimates ranged from a couple of hundred million pounds a year to a billion pounds, reflecting uncertainty about how the drug will be marketed.
""From a scientific point of view this is a very exciting prospect (but) in commercial terms there remain questions on its sales prospects,"" he said.
SocGen analyst Alyson Coates said she had cautiously estimated sales of 150 million pounds for the drug by the year 2000 and peak sales of 350 million pounds a year.
But she said questions remained about whether Lamivudine would be more effective when taken together with other drugs, just as Epivir works better in combination, and on how resistant the virus might be to the drug in some people.
Glaxo Wellcome is one of a number of companies working on products for Hepatitis B.
SmithKline Beecham Plc is developing a version of its herpes treatment Famvir, and Germany's Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Vion Pharmaceuticals Inc and Gilead Sciences Inc of the United States and Britain's Medeva Plc also have products in clinical trials. ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)

5,"Health and industrial gases specialist BOC Group Plc said on Tuesday that its troubled healthcare business is likely to turn in a flat performance in the current year to Sept 1997 before recovering.
In a telephone interview with Reuters following publication of the group's best-ever full-year profit figures, chief executive Danny Rosenkranz said the Ohmeda health business faced another challenging 12 months in tough U.S. markets.  
The anaesthetic gas and machinery supplier will be ""flat this year, but starting next year this thing ought to start climbing,"" said Rosenkranz.
The health division, hit by continued falls in the price of BOC's once top-selling anaesthetic gas Forane and weak U.S. demand for anaesthetic machinery, was the only BOC unit to see operating profits fall, dropping 11 percent to 53.1 million stg.
Solid gains in the rest of BOC's business saw full-year pre-tax profits rise by 10.6 percent to 444.9 million stg, right at the top of analysts' forecasts, while sales climbed 6.7 percent to just over 4.0 billion stg.  
The strong pound cut the advance in fourth-quarter pre-tax profits by three percentage points to around nine-percent, and Rosenkranz warned that stronger sterling ""is bound to hit profits"" if it continues.
Despite its laggardly performance, the fall in profits at healthcare was less steep than many analysts had feared after a warning from BOC at the end of the third quarter, which led to a rash of earnings downgrades.
Rosenkranz said the division, which accounted for less than 13 percent of BOC's 4.0 billion stg of sales, had performed ""much better"" in the fourth quarter.  
""You can go from being a bum to a hero very fast,"" he said.
The market had also been braced for a poor performance at Edwards Vaccum Products, whose machinery creates super-clean environments for industry, because of a downturn in the overcrowded semi-conductor market.
In the event the loose alliance of business known as vaccuum and distribution posted a 28 percent gain in full-year operating profit to 90.3 million stg, although the gain in the fourth-quarter had slowed to just eight percent as the impact of a fall-off in semi-conductor orders started to bite.  
Rosenkranz pointed to tentative signs of a pick up in the computer industry, such as a rise in the October U.S. industry book-to-bill ratio. But he said the vacuum business ""will see a decline in profits this year"", but did not predict its extent.
In the core industrial gases business, where operating profits rose 9 percent to 408.3 million stg on sales up 6.8 percent to 2.8 billion stg, Rosenkranz said he expected profit margins to rise by about 2 percentage points over the ""next three to four years.""
Margins edged up to 14.5 percent of sales in the year ended in September from 14.2 percent.  
A major factor behind the improvement will be the huge increase in the number of 15-year supply contracts BOC has won in the U.S. These entail BOC building gas-making plants next to customers such as steel works, in return for guaranteed sales.
The up-front costs involved in these contracts helped to push BOC's capital spending up to 708 million stg in the year just ended, and Rosenkranz said ""I think it will be higher this year.""
Outside the U.S, BOC is targeting investment in the Pacific region, notably in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Rosenkranz said BOC is also ""looking pretty hard at India"" where it could invest several hundred million pounds over the next few years.

5,"Fast-developing vaccine discovery group Peptide Therapeutics Plc said on Tuesday it planned to target North America in its quest for further alliances.
In a telephone interview with Reuters following the announcement of full-year results the group's new chief executive John Brown said ""what we want is big pharmaceutical companies andd the biggest concentration is in North Amercica.""
Peptide said on Tuesday that Alan Goodman would step down as chief executive to spearhead the group's assault on North America.  
Peptide already has major deals with SmithKline Beecham Plc and Medeva Plc under its belt. It agreed in January to develop vaccines using Medeva's expertise in creating non-injectable drugs and earlier this month licensed its portfolio of allergy vaccines to SmithKline Beecham.
Despite these high profile agreements, which have seen Peptide shares soar this year, Brown said there was still plenty in the cupboard to attract new partners. He said there was ""huge potential for our technology platforms,"" which include methods for discovering new vaccines and protease inhibitors, a class of drugs which help stop viruses from reproducing.  
Brown said the company would also be interested in finding partners to help develop early stage vaccines against Meningitis B and Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV), a breathing disorder which affects young children. Peptide is also looking at using peptides against rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and at using its vaccine technology for animal health.
Brown , said that Peptide, which floated on the stock market in November 1995, was now changing gear. ""We are entering the third phase of the company. Phase one was the venture capital, pre-flotation stage and in phase two we built up the company and established a solid base.""  
Peptide has built its Cambridge, England, headquarters up in the past 12 months to 77 staff from 28, and Brown said this could move to ""between 90 and 100 over the next year.""
Brown, who has relinquished the finance director's post to become chief executive, said the company was in a strong cash position, with 27.4 million stg of cash on its books.
""The burn rate may increase marginally this year to seven or eight million stg"" from 6.5 million in 1996, Brown added.

5,"Glaxo Wellcome Plc reported an 18 percent jump in 1996 pre-tax profit on Thursday but said it faced two lean years after its biggest-selling drug Zantac loses its U.S. patent in July.
Pre-tax profits at the world's number one prescription drugs company climbed to 2.964 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) from 2.505 billion, in the middle of analysts' expectations.
Sales rose nine percent to 8.341 billion pounds and shareholders were rewarded with a 13 percent rise in the dividend to 34.0 pence.
Despite a forecast of flat profits for 1997 and 1998 as a result of an anticipated plunge in sales of ulcer treatment Zantac, the group's shares ended the day 11-1/2 pence higher at 10.48 pounds, recovering from early falls.
Analysts said they were encouraged by the performance from the group's management, which is confident it can ride out the collapse of Zantac, the best-selling drug on which Glaxo built its international fortune.
Glaxo boldly predicted a return to double-digit sales growth in 1999, pinning its hopes on drugs for AIDs, asthma and migraine and promising 20 new product launches over the next four years.
SocGen's director of equity research, Paul Diggle, said Glaxo Wellcome had gone a long way to answering the question of whether it was ""a becalmed giant that through patent expiries is going to be hard-pressed to grow...or a serious growth player which faces a bit of a dip.""
BZW analyst Steve Plag added: ""We think that by the end of 1998 Glaxo Wellcome will be one of the strongest drug companies in the industry.""
Sales of Zantac slipped 14 percent last year as competition began to bite around the world but at 1.931 billion pounds they continued to make it the world's biggest-selling drug, a spot it has held since 1986.
The company said sales of Zantac in the U.S. market, which topped one billion pounds last year, could plunge by up to 80 percent in the first year of full competition.
""The tough period is mid-1997 to mid-1998, when Zantac will come under severe generic pressure in the U.S.,"" deputy chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Sykes told Reuters.
But he added: ""If you take Zantac out, we have a 6.4 billion sterling business growing at 14 percent. That underlying growth is a very clear indication of the strength of the group going forward.""
He said sales of Zantac fell by 324 million pounds last year, while a portfolio of newer products launched since 1990 saw sales rise by 650 million pounds to 2.0 billion pounds.
The group's top performers last year included its rejuvenated HIV and AIDs treatments, whose sales doubled to nearly 500 million pounds.
Retrovir and Epivir are cornerstones of new cocktails of drugs that have shown startling success in reducing virus levels, giving Glaxo a 57 percent share of the fast-expanding AIDs market.
Other big sellers included asthma drugs Serevent and Flixotide, which notched up combined sales of more than 500 million pounds, and migraine drug Imigran, which saw sales in the U.S. market alone leap by 69 percent last year.
Sales of the group's second-biggest product, herpes treatment Zovirax, which has already lost most of its key patents, were steady at 812 million pounds.
Despite persistent speculation that Glaxo Wellcome, formed after Glaxo's nine billion pound acquisition of Wellcome in 1995, would hit the acquisition trail again when debt levels allowed, Sykes said the pressure for mega-mergers had dissipated.
""The bigger companies get, the more difficult it is to buy them or merge, so the way forward will be much more looking at regional and local opportunities and building these as opportunities come along,"" he added. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds)

5,"British building materials group Blue Circle Industries Plc produced the first tentative signs of a turnaround at its troubled European heating operations on Tuesday and set out ambitious plans for a ten-fold increase in operating profits at the division over the next three years.
The recovery in the heating sector, together with continued strong performance in the highly profitable Chile and Malaysia markets and the USA, helped lift Blue Circle's interim pretax profit by 11.7 percent to 116.3 million pounds ($181.5 million), at the top end of analysts' forecasts, with the interim dividend rising by 6 percent to 4.25 pence.
The heating operations, which are undergoing a major restructuring focused on France, Germany and the Britain, posted operating profits of nine million pounds in the six months to June, up from just 100,000 pounds a year before.
However, Britain's biggest cement producer also warned that it sees ""no significant signs of recovery"" in the key British cement market, and against a backdrop of a weak stock market Blue Circle shares slipped 5.5 pence to 373.5 pence by 1105 GMT.
Blue Circle chief executive Keith Orrell-Jones told Reuters the group's aim of achieving annual cost savings of 25 million pounds from restructuring heating is ""well up to programme,"" with nine million pounds coming through this year and the full benefit seen in 1997.
Orrell-Jones said he is confident the group can achieve a 15 percent return on its 600 million pound investment in the struggling division, or some 90 million pound, within three years, despite sluggish economic performance in Germany and France.
""We are disappointed with the performance of the economies of both those countries, and we think it is not likely to ease very rapidly,"" said Orrell-Jones, adding ""that is why we set a three-year time horizon"" for recovery.
Blue Circle blamed a 24 percent drop in operating profit at the British cement operations on low infrastructure investment and ""weak new housing starts."" Orrell-Jones said the full-year outcome will be better than the first half, but he does not expect any real upturn until next spring.
With gearing a miniscule 1.5 percent at the end of June, Orrell-Jones confirmed Blue Circle is actively looking for opportunities to expand.
""We'd like to grow our cement business: it depends on where the opportunities crop up. In the U.S. it's a question of waiting for the right opportunity and the right time in the cycle,"" he said.
Blue Circle is ""actively looking in South-East Asia, and we are taking a very careful look at India,"" he said, adding that it is also interested in expanding its south American operations beyond the fast-growing Chile market.

5,"BOC Group Plc launched on Thursday a breathable, liquefied version of air which could create temporary cold stores in minutes and provide super-cold conditions for testing aircraft engines.
BOC said the product, which is a mixture of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen, was the first gas of its kind that could be breathed safely and represented a major breakthrough.
Food retailers had already shown great interest in the gas, which would allow companies to turn anything from giant warehouses to small rooms into temporary chilled stores without using massive refrigeration equipment, it said.
""If you need a cold store for one day a week or two hours a day then there is some technology to do it,"" said BOC managing director of technology Deb Chatterji.
Possible uses for the gas, which was developed in Britain and the United States, were endless. ""The only limit on this is the limit of our imaginations,"" he said, adding that annual sales could eventually ""be north of 20 million pounds ($32.40 million) and south of 200 million pounds"".
BOC had originally wanted to find a way of enabling refrigerated lorries to keep their loads cool over ""multi-drop"" deliveries, which meant finding a gas that someone entering the back of the lorry could breathe.
People cannot breathe liquid nitrogen, the current mainstay of refrigeration.
A number of companies including Air Products and Chemicals Inc of the U.S. are believed to have studied the complex storage problems created by liquefied air, which has a temperature of minus 191 degrees centigrade.
However, BOC is the first to launch the gas commercially.
It has already been tested on poultry farms, where it dramatically cut death rates caused by high summer temperatures.
BOC said it could eventually be used to air condition spaces like rock concert venues and to create extreme-temperature test chambers for the aerospace and other high-tech industries.
Britain is being used as a commercial test-bed for the gas, and BOC said it would make a decision about expanding production and overseas marketing at the end of the year.

5,"British Gas Plc, which unveiled an expected sharp deterioration in interim profits on Thursday, is in a ""realistic phase of negotiations"" with producers over crippling gas supply contracts, chairman Richard Giordano said.
In a telephone interview with Reuters, Giordano said so-called ""take or pay"" contracts, which oblige it to buy gas at prices well above market rates, were a major factor behind growing losses at its industrial and commercial division.
""The solution to the losses is for us to unhook from take of pay,"" Giordano said.  
British Gas said progress on the contracts, which force it to pay around 20 pence per therm for gas compared to market rates of 10 to 13 pence, ""is a gradual process.""
""We are in intense negotiations now. We have said we will not do this in public and so both sides are keeping quiet,"" Giordano said.
He added that losses at the industrial and commerical arm rose to 180 million stg from around 50 million a year before as greater competition and costs related to the planned demerger kicked in. First-half results would have been worse but for a 200 million pound benefit from severe winter weather, he said.  
But Giordano said there was no sign of commercial and industrial losses accelerating in the second quarter from the first and stood by his forecast for full-year losses of ""close to"" 400 million stg at the division.
He also held out some hope on the other main headcahes for British Gas, talks with regulator Ofgas on separate price reviews of its Transco and domestic energy businesses.
Giordano refused to be drawn on the crucial Transco review but made clear British Gas has not yet slammed the door on an agreement. ""There is nothing to say on this. We are still meeting with Ofgas,"" Giordano said.  
Ofgas wants Transco to cut charges to gas suppliers by 20 percent in 1997 and then 6.5 points below inflation for four years. British Gas, which has until October 7 to respond, has warned this could have serious consequences for dividends.
Giordano said the group will only be able give indications on dividend prospects when there is clarity on Transco.
But he was more upbeat about the domestic review, wehere Ofgas wants to fix price changes to five points below inflation. He said a resolution should be in place by ""the end of September or the middle of October,"" adding ""my guess is that we are closer to Ofgas and Ofgas is closer to us on that review.""  
Giordano told Reuters British Gas is preparing to beef up incentives to keep domestic customers loyal when the market opens fully to competition in 1998. It launched a credit card on Wednesday, which will allow users to save on gas bills.
He said other initiatives planned include offering illness or unemployment insurance to cover bills, and gas safety checks.
Giordano said a pilot scheme in south-west England has seen the company lose only around 15 percent of customers to rivals, and noted that British Gas has ""more freedom"" to act than in the commercial market, where market share has plummeted because ""our tariffs were locked up and our hands were tied.""  
Giordano said British Gas's progress towards a demerger into two separate companies, Transco International and British Gas Energy, ""are going ok. We are still on target for the Spring of next year.""
He said the formation of the two exective boards has removed ""the biggest hurdle.""
""I'd guess that before the end of the year we'll have a definite plan for the media and shareholders,"" he said, adding: ""Looking ahead if these managements do their job both (companies) should have a basis for prosperity.""

Bain told Reuters in an interview following publication of results that showed a sharp fall in 1996 profits: ""We are poised for a period of growth from the base we have put in place."" He added, ""The company is well placed to move ahead in 1997 and future years, although the extent of that does depend on some factors outside our control,"" including exchange rates and economic trends.  
Bain said he felt now was the right time to stand down as chief executive after 6-1/2 years, and added that he hoped to take up other directorships and chairmanships.
""We agreed at the end of last year that this would be a good time to go,"" Bain said.
He said he would continue to be available to assist Coats Viyella. Bain said his successor, former McKechnie Plc chief executive Michael Ost, ""has a very good track record, and he did not expect him to change the group's strategy.  
""This year's results, in difficult circumstances, are exactly in line with expectations and the trading statement that we made at the end of last year,"" said Bain. ""Underlying profit is down by seven percent, which is a tad disappointing, but given the state of this industry that certainly would augur well in (comparison with) our peer group.""
Bain said cost savings from the group's reorganisation, which led to charges of 54.9 million stg against 1996 profits, were flowing through faster than expected. Savings in 1996 totalled 12 million pounds against a prediction of 10 million stg.  
Bain said he was ""confident"" that savings of at least 35 million stg would be achieved in 1998.
He highlighted the performance of the group's home furnishings division, where operating profits rose 42 percent to 12.5 mllion stg, and the continued strength of fashion retail, which he said had built profits to 13.1 million stg in 1996 from around 2.0 million over the past five years.
But he said the performance of clothing, where profits fell 12 percent to 19.1 million stg, ""was not satisfactory."" He said the division had been affected by disruption from restructuring, which involves relocation of a number of operations.  
Bain said he was confident management ""is doing the right things to secure greater profits into the future, but it is taking us a bit longer than anticipated."" He added that group was looking for a ""significant improvement"" on the division's profit margins of between three and four percent.
The core threads division, where operating profits fell 10.4 percent to 90.3 million stg, had enjoyed a stronger fourth quarter after a weak first half, Bain said.

5,"Anglo-U.S. drugs group SmithKline Beecham Plc said on Tuesday that it expected anti-depressent Paxil/Seroxat to take over as its best-selling drug by the end of this year.
In a telephone interview with Reuters finance director Hugh Collum said it was probable that Paxil/Seroxat ""will be the biggest selling product by the end of this year.""Sales of the drug, which competes with Eli Lilly &amp; Co's Prozac, jumped 42 percent last year to 706 million stg, gaining ground on SmithKline's current top seller, antibiotic Augmentin.  
""The added indication of panic disorder gives us added uniqueness"" in comparison with Prozac, said Collum. Although he declined to give sales targets for Paxil, he said ""we are very optimistic"" and noted that Prozac sales were in excess of $2 billion a year.
The finance director also highlighted the Havrix hepatitis A vaccine, Hycamtin for ovarian cancer and anti-emetic Kytril as potential strong growth products looking ahead, together with combination vaccines like Infanrix.  
SmithKline does not expect drugs to flow from its DNA research link with Human Genome Sciences (HGS) until after the turn of the century, Collum said. But he noted the licensing arrangements on DNA-based drugs already in place with major competitors including Merck &amp; Co and Schering-Plough Corp and added ""we are very optimistic. Looking back I think it was a very good investment decision.""
Collum said he was ""really very pleased"" at the reduction in the group's stubbornly high debt levels, which came down to 1.64 billion stg at the end of 1996 from around 1.8 billion at the start of the year.  
However, he said that with capital expenditure expected to total around 550 million stg this year, debt levels would only ""come down a bit"" in 1997.
He said operating margins would continue to be affected by high research and development spending and marketing costs related to over-the-counter products.
Collum said he hoped the Clinical Laboratories operation, which has been hit by changes in U.S. reimbursement rules for diagnostic tests, was ""back on track.""
""We hope so. On the other hand there are still pressures on it. It is the third biggest in the U.S, we have a good geographical spread but it is still difficult,"" Collum said.

22,"China's cautious and much-delayed experiment with convertible bonds as a way of raising corporate funds is expected to move forward next year with up to 6-10 foreign currency issues, brokers and analysts said on Wednesday.
Chinese securities authorities have said on a number of occasions they want to conduct test issues of convertible bonds, which give holders an option to convert the debt into stock.
Only a small handful of cases have been tried so far with very mixed results. But analysts said they believed authorities were increasingly taking a favourable attitude towards the concept of convertible bonds.
This is reflected in the many listed Chinese firms which have said in recent months they are considering or planning to launch bonds convertible into their foreign currency B shares, listed on China stock markets, or H shares listed in Hong Kong.
""The prospects for convertible bonds next year look good,"" said a senior analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""I would say there could be up to 10 issues in 1997. The process has been slower than expected, but China has a need for more funds.""
""There's a lot of momentum on convertible bonds at present,"" said John Crossman, general manager of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai. ""We've been pushing the concept with companies and officials and it's now taken on a momentum of its own.""
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is believed to have received a pile of applications for such issues but is cautious about proceeding partly because of a number of unsuccessful past attempts at issuing convertible bonds.
""China Textile Machinery's issue of convertible bonds, for instance, was a disaster,"" said the senior analyst. ""Nobody has converted the bonds to shares, so they have to pay back the money by the end of this year.""
But a stock analyst in Shenzhen said the market was ready to accept convertible bonds as a concept.
""The overall financial environment has matured to the point where it's possible to look at convertible bonds. But the companies which issue them need to be relatively good to ensure they have the ability to repay,"" the analyst said.
He said the prospect of convertible bonds as a means of raising capital is extremely attractive to China's listed companies because, unlike direct equity, it does not immediately dilute earnings.
The latest Chinese company to announce a convertible bond is Zhenhai Refining &amp; Chemical Co Ltd which said last month it would issue US$200 million of bonds convertible into the firm's H shares.
Other companies that have indicated an interest include truck maker Qingling Motors Co and Shenzhen-listed Jiangling Motors
But the experience of China Textile Machinery indicates that there is risk involved in issuing convertible bonds for companies as well as for investors.
""The advantage over a straight bond is that the company is placing a bet that it will be able to pay back with shares rather than cash. But there's a risk involved,"" said one foreign analyst.
""The authorities want to choose large, stable companies that are going to have the cash income to repay the bonds if the conversion proves difficult because of problems with the share price,"" he added.

22,"China's stock markets, greeting the Year of the Ox on Monday after a two-week lunar new year break, are expected to perform well through the year but with trading more subdued than last year, analysts said on Sunday.
The analysts said the two main positives for the China share markets this year were the country's strong economy and Beijing's apparent desire to have the financial markets on an upswing to mark Hong Kong's return to Chinese control on July 1.
But the ""Ox Year"" enthusiasm of stock investors was tempered by the determination of the Chinese securities authorities to push speculative funds out of the markets and make them less casino-like, they said.
""The major factor for the stock markets in the Year of the Ox will be the improved national economy,"" said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage.
""But we don't expect to see any dramatic surges like last year. The central government is stressing market stability,"" he said.
""The Hong Kong takeover will have a great psychological impact on the markets,"" a stock analyst said. ""I see most of (China's) share indices hitting record highs around the time of Hong Kong's return.""
Some brokers said they believed there would be a correction in April and early May in response to the generally poor 1996 results expected from listed companies.
But they said the markets were expected to perform strongly from June through to August during the period of the Hong Kong handover, and the rises could be sustained through the rest of the year assuming China's economy remained strong.
On the last trading day of the Year of the Rat on January 31, Shanghai's A share index closed at 1006.362 points against an historical high of 1640.710, while the B share index was 66.894 points against an all-time high of 105.780.
Shenzhen's A share index ended at 372.54 points against a record of 502.77 and the B index was 157.06 against 201.87.
The official China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday that the stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen could see an over-supply of share issues this year due to a big increase in listings combined with falling investor activity in equities.
The securities authorities set a new share issue quota at the end of last year of 10 billion yuan, double the previous quota.
""Demand for stocks was expected to wither after the market cooled down from excessive speculation,"" the newspaper quoted an expert as saying.
The authorities moved to rein in the share markets in mid-December after months of feverish trading which pushed prices up dramatically.
Many investors last year responded to two interest rate cuts by removing funds from their bank accounts to invest in the stock markets. But the China Daily said the impact of the rate cuts was fading.
The stock markets were also expected to suffer from the crackdown on the use of illegal funds to buy shares, particularly the use of credit, the newspaper said.
""Although there are no precise figures for illegal funds in the stock market, including overdrafts, corporation loans and banking deposits, the illegal money contributed significantly to the overheated market last year,"" it said.

22,"China is setting up a national state debt trading market to link up all state debt trading floors around the nation to check widespread irregularities, industry analysts said on Monday.
The computerised market, the China State Debt Clearing System, would gradually take over the trading of all state debt in the country with the current markets, including the Shanghai stock exchange, taking a minor role, they said.
""Nearly all China's state debt trading is now regional,"" said a trader with China Guotai Securities. ""An institution trading in Shanghai cannot have its positions cleared in Shenzhen, which is inconvenient.
""With the new market being opened, a trader can bid and ask on any market around the country through the computer network,"" he said.
Major players on China's state debt markets currently include state banks, securities houses, state enterprises and wealthy individuals looking for quick returns or for short-term cash for speculative investment elsewhere.
The bulk of China's state debt is traded through the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges, but there are dozens of other centres through which state debt can be traded.
""The primary purpose of the market is to check rampant irregularities,"" said one state debt investment analyst. ""The most important aim is to eradicate credit trading.""
China's securities rules ban the trading of state debt on credit but in practice many trading centres have accepted 20 percent margin requirements for state debt repurchase trading, traders said.
The state debt margin trading has led to huge losses for some state banks and other financial institutions, due to unrecoverable debts, traders say. The official media reported in mid-1996 that the Wuhan Securities Exchange Centre, the Tianjin Securities Exchange Centre and the STAQ system, which trades China's institutional shares, had accumulated debts on the repo market of up to 50 billion yuan ($6.02 billion).
Traders said some banks and brokerages had already started to put their state debt under the auspices of the new market but that formal trading on the system, based in Beijing, was not expected to start until the second half of this year.
""Once the national market begins full operations, financial institutions will be required to have all their state debt entrusted to it,"" said one trader. ""This will effectively end credit trading.""
Another reason for setting up the centrally-controlled computerised market was to enforce a recent ban on state banks trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets, analysts said.
The central bank at a recent meeting told state banks to phase out trading on the markets, not to build new positions and to offset existing positison only gradually, to ensure that bank money would not flow into the volatile stock markets.
""All we big four state commercial banks have to get out of the markets,"" said one banker with the Bank of China. ""The new market will enable the central government to enforce the ban.""
The big four are the Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank, the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
Industry sources said the People's Bank of China, the central bank, was preparing to play a major role on the new market to trade short-term treasury bills of one year and below with the state banks in its open market operations.

22,"A sudden crackdown on China's fledging stock markets pushed most shares to limit-down levels on Monday and triggered an outcry from securities brokerages and retail investors.
The People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, said in a commentary on Monday that the country's stock markets had overheated on widespread speculation and warned that Beijing would not step in to help if the stock markets plunged.
Virtually all shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets fell 10 percent, the daily limit announced by the authorities last Friday afternoon to prevent sharp fluctuations.
""This is very, very disappointing and outrageous,"" said one local stock analyst. ""With this simple decision they can wipe out nearly all the gains in the securities business in a hard year.""
""I can't understand it,"" said a trader. ""Such administrative edicts will eventually kill the markets one day.""
Analysts said they were shocked by the sudden change of direction by officials in Beijing.
Since April there have been many official statements, messages and hints indicating clearly that the stock markets had the official blessing of Beijing.
China's foreign currency B share market in Shanghai soared by about 80 percent between November 11 and December 10 while the bourse in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen rose by about 100 percent before sharp falls in the final days of last week.
Shanghai's A share index had surged more than 100 percent and Shenzhen's A share index nearly 300 percent since April.
""They had been talking about encouraging stock invesment and suddenly here comes the new policy,"" said a retail investor. ""Most of us will have our money caught in the markets. It looks like prices will plunge and no one wants to buy.""
Foreign brokers and analysts also slammed the sudden official intervention, saying it went counter to the trend in China of gradually allowing market forces and controls to play a greater role.
""Foreign investors will not welcome such administrative interference in the markets,"" said a Shanghai-based brokerage analyst. ""What is worse is that it seems from the People's Daily editorial that they wanted to force prices down.""
Shanghai's domestic A share index plunged 9.92 percent to 1,047.680 points and the foreign currency B shares fell 9.6 percent to 59.929 points.
In Shenzhen, the B share index dived 10 percent to 134.43, and the A share index also 10 percent to 417.20.
Brokers and analysts said they expected another 10 percent limit-down day for the markets on Tuesday, with virtually no buyers in sight, and a great sense of unease amongst investors about how quickly the market can be turned by officials edicts.
""For Shanghai B shares, tomorrow will be another 10 percent, but on the third day it may be less,"" said another foreign brokerage analyst. ""Buying interest is very limited.""
""Panic selling occurred in many securities trading halls in major brokerages,"" said one trader. ""But nobody wants to buy. Investors believe current prices are very high taking into account the changed market fundamentals after the crackdown.""
A second trader said market confidence was destroyed. ""We can see no support for the time being,"" he said. The B index is likely to head for a historical low at around 45 points shortly.""
In Shenzhen, local brokers said most Shenzhen-listed stocks were likely to register limit-down closes over the next few sessions as investors have been intimidated by the People's Daily commentary.
""They could have adopted other measures such as an effective ban on widespread illicit trading by institutional punters to cap share prices,"" a Shenzhen trader complained. ""Instead, this method sacrifices many innocent, small investors.""
Many investors, including institutions, were sitting on heavy losses on today's fall and investor confidence was unlikely to recover over the short term, brokers said.

22,"Foreign airline executives on Tuesday called for Shanghai's new airport to handle a mixture of international and domestic flights and for early consultations with foreign airlines before its 1999 scheduled opening.
Construction work on the new airport in Pudong, which will eventually be the biggest in China, begins this month in the Pudong zone to the east of Shanghai city. It will supplement the existing airport at Hongqiao to the west.
But airline representatives said there was no indication which airport they will be required to operate from after 1999 or what arrangements will be made for them.
Many said they understood the Pudong airport, 30 km (18 miles) from the city centre, would handle international flights and Hongqiao domestic ones.
""But I think that, from an airline perspective, it would not be wise to limit either airport to solely international or domestic traffic,"" said one airline executive who asked not to be named.
""I know they have plans for new infrastructure but I'm not going to hold my breath for some sort of rapid transit route from Pudong to Hongqiao,"" he said.
Traffic in Shanghai is very congested, although city officials say the problem will be eased by a network of elevated highways being constructed around and through the city.
Lu Jianhua, an official with the Pudong airport planning office, said the current plan was to have both international and domestic flights operating from both airports, but that final arrangements had not been settled.
""The specifics of flight assignments to the two airports still need to be decided,"" Lu said.
The first phase of Pudong airport will include a 4,000-metre runway and a 150,000 square metre main building, costing a total of 12 billion yuan ($1.46 billion).
The airport at that point will be able to accommodate 20 million passengers and 750,000 tonnes of air cargo, more than double the present capacity of Hongqiao.
The whole Pudong airport project, to be completed in 15-20 years, calls for four runways and an annual capacity of 70 million passengers and five million tonnes of air cargo.
Lu said a new unified administration would be created to manage both Hongqiao and Pudong airports. They are currently two separate entities and foreign airline executives said they sensed a competitiveness between the two.
Asked which airport he would prefer to operate from, one airline representative said: ""We're not going to be given a choice, we will go where they tell us to go.
""But I don't know anything about Pudong. I haven't seen any drawings. We haven't been asked to participate in the design, although we have offered,"" he added.
Design of the airport terminal has been won by a French consortium, Aeroports de Paris, but the representative said the foreign airlines wanted to have input into the design as early as possible.
""We are concerned because Hongqiao airport is massively inadequate today, despite the fact that it's as good as any large airport in China. We are concerned that, without some input from us, we may end the same way in Pudong,"" he said.
"
22,"Last week's stern crackdown on China's stock markets has increased the speculative instinct of investors to trade on rumours of policy shifts rather than on fundamentals, analysts said Monday.
The share markets started their latest bull run in April when Beijing announced it would support the markets.
Rumours and guesses about Beijing's attitude and plans have been the primary trading factor ever since, the analysts said.
While the Beijing authorities have been trying to convince investors to look more at long-term investment based on the fundamentals of the economy and of individual companies, they again chose an old-fashioned means of reining in the markets.
""The crackdown has shown again the risk of policy changes for China's stock markets,"" said an executive with a major Chinese securities house.
""Policy changes have been a very hot speculative topic in the past and the use of administrative orders like this to cool down the markets will make them an even hotter topic in the long run,"" he added.
Beijing last Monday charged that China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were overheated and warned that Beijing would not come to investors' rescue if the markets crashed.
""The action has cooled speculative activity for now,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""But the investment pattern has not changed. It is still political issues which drive the stock market up and down.""
In the shake-out last week, investors generally took refuge in blue-chip shares and dumped the so-called ""rubbish shares"" that have soared in recent months on the basis of little more than an impression that Beijing wanted the markets up.
Analysts said market psychology could have been better influenced if the authorities had pulled share prices back down using market means such as the issue of more shares or the listing of some state or institutional shares.
One key problem of the Chinese stock markets is the lack of suitable supervisory mechanisms and regulations, leading to widespread irregularities such as share price manipulation and the use of credit for stock trading, the analysts said.
""With a stock market law lacking and regulations incomplete, many trading activities are in a legal no-man's land, making it difficult to check irregularities,"" said one analyst.
The draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted any time soon, due partly to differences over who will have the final say on securities policy, the analysts said.
Responsibility for securities policy at present overlaps between the Securities Commission under the State Council (cabinet), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People's Bank of China, or central bank.
Shanghai's domestic A share index rose 17.606 points or 1.91 percent on Monday to end at 939.946 after losing about 20 percent in last week's trading. The foreign currency B share index was up 0.944 points or 1.48 percent to 64.687.
In Shenzhen, the A share index fell 6.71 points or 2.04 percent to 322.25, while the B share index soared 6.11 percent or 7.68 points to 133.24.
"
22,"Shanghai B shares soared a stunning 12.22 percent on Tuesday as new money poured into the market from both local and foreign investors, and analysts said there was a lot more capital waiting to enter the market.
The Shanghai foreign currency B share index closed at 84.534 points, its highest level since September, 1994, with the supply of shares unable to meet the demand, traders said.
One foreign analyst said he expected the B share index to top the 100-point mark before the end of the year, with investors increasingly confident the authorities had decided to allow local Chinese investors to stay in the B share market.
""What we're seeing is a lot of stir-frying of dog stocks,"" said Bruce Richardson, chief Shanghai representative for HG Asia, referring to widespread buying of weaker counters.
""There's nothing in the fundamentals to justify this. But this is liquidity-driven and there's a lot more money waiting to come in,"" he said.
Shenzhen B shares, however, which surged a week or so earlier than Shanghai, fell back 2.15 percent on Tuesday to end at 193.87 on profit-taking after steep rises over the past few sessions, brokers said.
A fundamental factor in the Shanghai B market is a growing feeling that the merger of the foreign currency B shares and the A shares denominated in local currency on China's two stock exchanges will come sooner than expected.
""The spread between the A and B share P/Es is substantial,"" said a foreign analyst in Shanghai. ""The market average for the Shanghai A shares is 55 and 19 for the B shares, so local investors see the opportunity for capital gains in a unification of the two.""
A Chinese broker agreed.
""Every day we are seeing so much fresh capital flowing into the market because investors believe the B share prices are going to move closer to their counterparts in the A share market,"" he said.
The Chinese authorities have so far made no predictions on when the two types of shares might be merged, saying only that the day is a long way off.
John Crossman, general manager of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, said both locals and foreigners wanted to get into the Shanghai B share market.
""For locals, it is an easy decision when B shares are at a 75 percent discount to A shares,"" he said. ""Foreigners are well disposed to China in 1997 and 1998 and do not want to be net sellers of Chinese equities.""
He said the current bull run could continue for another couple of months.
But other analysts said the extreme volatility of the market posed a threat, particularly for holders of many of the weaker and smaller B shares, when the correction begins.
""Locals are not so discriminatory in the shares they buy and have bought shares simply because they were cheap,"" said one analyst.
""But for some poor-quality shares the prices are not sustainable. As soon as the momentum peters out, there will be a lot of sifting and these shares will go down quickly,"" the analyst added.

22,"Shanghai's port will be expanded to improve container handling and the approach channels will be deepened to accommodate large container ships, the port director said on Friday.
The port's container throughput rose 29 percent to 1.97 million units last year and should rise by a further 21 percent to 2.3 million units this year, director Du Deming said.
""The aim is to reach three million units by the end of the century but we could surpass that, we are doing the preparatory work to meet this challenge,"" Du said in an interview.
Shanghai port, China's largest, has been hampered for more than a century by shallow approach channels and silt build-up from the Yangtze River. Despite continual dredging the approches are only seven metres deep.
""We need to deepen the approaches by five metres, through a combination of engineering and dredging, to bring the depth of the approaches to 12.5 metres,"" Du said.
""The plan is to achieve this within the next 10 years. It will be a big project with several phases,"" he added.
Du declined to estimate the amount of investment required to achieve the plan, saying it was under study.
""Water depth is one of our biggest problems. We need to deepen the approaches as soon as possible to allow in the third-, fourth- and even fifth-generation container ships which can hold 5,000 containers and more,"" Du said.
Fifth-generation container vessels have visited Shanghai, but never fully loaded.
Du said investment in new facilities and reconstruction in Shanghai port would drop somewhat this year below last year's 1.1 billion yuan ($132 million), but that investment would resume growing in 1998. He declined to give details.
He said the port was trying to improve efficiency and had brought average ship turn-around times down to two days last year, a 10 percent improvement over 1995.
""We are inevitably competing for business with other ports in the region, and ship owners and cargo owners can make their own choice,"" he said. ""We need to improve facilities, equipment and particularly information systems.""
But Du said he did not see Shanghai port as competing with Hong Kong, which last year handled 13 million standard containers, more than six times the throughput of Shanghai.
""There is not much conflict. China is such a big country that both ports can continue to be prosperous. Hong Kong basically handles the south of the country, and Shanghai the Yangtze basin,"" he said.
Development of the deep-water port of Ningbo port 200 km (125 miles) south of Shanghai has often been tipped as the answer to the port congestion and silting that dog Shanghai, but Du was cautious on the issue.
""We're looking into it,"" he said. ""Shanghai and Ningbo should both be developed, there is not enough capacity in either to meet the demand.""
"
22,"China's B shares continued their sensational surge on Tuesday with Shanghai's index gaining 11.63 percent and Shenzhen 4.7 percent as foreign and Chinese investors poured funds into the markets.
Trading volume on the Shanghai B share market hit a 15-month high of 63.595 with the index ending up 6.525 points or 11.63 percent at 62.639 points.
Brokers said market sentiment had been boosted by the recent strong performance of the Shenzhen B share market on expectations that Beijing plans measures to boost B share trading.
The Shenzhen B share index rose 7.42 points, or 4.70 percent, to end at 165.10.
The Shenzhen market has risen far further and faster than Shanghai in the past two weeks, but dealers said there were signs that the action was now moving north to Shanghai.
""There's a feeling that foreign investors largely missed the boat on Shenzhen and they don't want to miss out on Shanghai as well,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai.
ING Barings said that as a result of the heavy volume of trading, the company had today activated both its seats on the Shanghai Stock Exchange for the first time ever.
""There were signs that overseas institutions are paying more attention to B shares,"" one broker said. ""The short-term market trend is bright.""
But a second broker said the sharp rises woiuld inevitably be followed by a tumble, possibly as early as Wednesday.
""The market will see a technical correction after the sharp rise today,"" he said.
Shanghai Dajiang was the star on the Shanghai market, surging $0.132 or 34.37 percent to $0.516 on volume of 1.1 million shares.
Shanghai Jintai followed on bargain-hunting, soaring $0.038 or 28.78 percent to $0.170 on volume of 712,000 shares.
A foreign broker said the money coming into the market appeared to be about half-and-half foreign and domestic Chinese, in spite of the theoretical ban on local Chinese investors buying the foreign currency B shares.
Given the obvious lack of measures by the authorities to revive the supposed ban, the markets appear to be gaining confidence that local investors will not face being forced out of the market, at least for now, analysts said.
""The bull run may extend into later this week with the inflow of fresh money continuing,"" one broker said.
"
22,"China's securities authorities are trying once again to ban domestic investors from the foreign currency B share market, but brokers said on Friday that the drive had little chance of success.
Chinese brokerages in Shanghai and Shenzhen this week started re-registering investor accounts to weed out domestic investors who are trading B shares, theoritically reserved for foreigners only.
But stock analysts said the painstaking process of driving locals from the B shares seems to have resulted in a compromise with the securities authorities, in fact trying to find an indirect way to legalise those already in the markets.
""The impact on the market will be minimal,"" said a Shanghai broker. ""Many investors are trying one way or another to find a trustee, and we believe most of them will be able to do so.""
Brokers said domestic investors with B share accounts had to find a foreigner, or someone with right of residence outside China, to write a certificate to say that he or she entrusts the local person to trade B shares.
""It seems that in Shanghai it is just a matter of walking in with your cousin's passport, but in Shenzhen I understand they are seriously trying to cut back on accounts opened with just an identity card,"" said Bruce Richardson of HG Asia in Shanghai.
Those who manage to obtain the trading certificate will be able to retain their accounts and can continue to legally trade B shares in their own name. Those that fail will be banned from buying new shares from April 1, brokers said.
""This is nothing more than a compromise,"" said a broker with a Chinese brokerage in Shanghai. ""The overwhelming majority of domestic investors will be able to find a trustee.""
The B shares were created in 1992 to attract foreign investment funds into China, but as a result of a market slump that began in 1994, many foreign investors have pulled out.
Their place has been taken by domestic investors, attracted by the large gap in price between B share prices and the much higher prices on the domestic A share market.
Brokers estimate that domestic investors have accounted for at least half of B-share trading in recent months, and concerns that the authorities really mean business about pushing the domestic investors out has been a major negative factor.
In mid-1996, a rush to B share trading by domestic investors pushed Shenzhen's B share index up more than 100 percent and the Shanghai index up 50 percent in just a few weeks.
""The China Securities Regulatory Commission has the tools if they want to really shut down every local B share investor, but I don't think they'll do it, it would be too costly,"" said HG Asia's Richardson.
""If you took local funds out of the market, or froze them, the market would go back to where it used to be, which I don't think anyone wants,"" he said.
He said that the CSRC was about the only player that wanted the locals out of the market -- the stock exchanges, brokerages and foreign investors all basically welcomed them because of the extra liquidity they bring to what is still a very small market.
"
48,"Canada unveiled plans on Friday to lift restrictions on foreign banks in a bid to spur competition in a sector dominated by six big domestic banks.
Draft legislation allowing foreign banks to open branches in Canada will be ready before the end of 1997. But a possible federal election may delay the passage of the bill in Canada's parliament until next year, said Doug Peters, secretary of state for financial institutions.
""Branching will encourage new banks to enter the Canadian marketplace and allow existing foreign banks greater opportunity to compete,"" Peters said in a statement.
He told reporters that the government needed time to develop branching rules, including a tax regime.
Foreign bankers have complained that Canada lagged behind its Group of Seven trading partners in opening up its banking sector to foreign competition.
Current rules require foreign banks to operate separately capitalized subsidiaries in Canada. The higher cost of operating a subsidiary, rather than a branch, has driven several foreign banks out of the country.
Last year a federal ""white paper"" on financial reforms introduced only minor changes to foreign bank rules, but parliament subsequently issued reports urging freer access to Canada's markets for foreign banks.
The number of foreign banks operating in Canada has dropped to 43 from a peak of about 60 in the 1980s. The legislation has not been written yet, but a freer market would make Canada more attractive, said Alfred Buhler, chairman of Bank of America Canada, a unit of BankAmerica Corp.
""It will slow the erosion and may reverse that trend. I think a number of banks who are not currently operating in Canada will take another hard look,"" Buhler said.
Canada's big six domestic banks already dominate regular banking, trusts and brokerages. But they are being challenged by the Internet and the rise of new ""virtual banks.""
Dutch financial services giant ING Groep N.V. is set to launch a telephone banking operation in Canada early next year and has earmarked an initial investment of $50 million for direct marketing of a range of savings and loans products.
Citicorp and Wells Fargo and Co. are also planning banking services aimed at Canadian consumers and small businesses.
Canadian bankers have said they would welcome more foreign competition as long as it is on a level playing field.
""We have absolutely no concerns about being able to compete successfully. There is a need to ensure that regulations -- tax, capital adequacy, corporate governance policies and so on -- are reasonably balanced,"" Bank of Nova Scotia chairman Peter Godsoe said recently.
Canadian bankers complained that their foreign rivals did not pay the same capital taxes in Canada as domestic banks. They also argued that virtual banks would not create new jobs in Canada, although critics noted that Canadian banks had shed staff recently in a move to electronic banking services.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest bank with more than $150 billion in assets, supports granting more access to foreign banks if rules barring Canadian banks from getting bigger are lifted.
Royal Bank and its counterparts have seen their international rankings slip sharply in recent years. They argue domestic bank mergers may be necessary if Canada is to remain competitive internationally.
Federal laws discourage bank mergers by limiting investors to a minimum 10 percent stake in a Canadian bank. A government task force plans to study these and other competition issues this year.
"
48,"Canada's top securities regulator and its biggest stock exchange said on Friday they are working on tougher rules for Canada's mining sector -- tarnished at home and abroad by the Busang gold saga.
The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and Toronto Stock Exchange have been under fire since news that Busang may not be the century's richest gold find, rocked the mining world.
In a joint statement, the OSC and TSE said a special task force would examine setting new standards for how companies conducted exploration programs and how the results were reported.
""We haven't concluded that (new standards are needed), but we feel it's appropriate at this stage to look at the situation,"" said OSC Chairman Jack Geller.
The TSE is also considering tightening procedures for listing new companies. Questions have been raised about the due diligence the exchange performed on Bre-X Minerals Ltd. before including it in the key TSE 300 and TSE 100 indices.
Critics say the controversy swirling around Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X, the discoverer of Busang, has given Canada a black eye.
Bre-X has been under pressure since preliminary tests by its partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. on the Busang gold property indicated the deposit may contain ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, off the company's stock market value.
Bre-X has commissioned an independent audit of the Busang project and stood by its estimate of 70.95 million ounces of gold. While investors anxiously await the test results expected in early May, attention has turned to the personal stock trades of top Bre-X officials.
The OSC, which is probing Bre-X for possible violation of insider trading and disclosure laws, said on Friday that no Bre-X insiders reported trades last month when the stock collapsed. The Alberta Securities Commission on Friday also reported no activity by Bre-X officials in March.
As the OSC/TSE task force gets down to work with a report due in autumn, some foreign miners are already trying to distance themselves from Canada's tarred image.
In a statement issued shortly after the Bre-X selloff, U.S.-based Nevada Pacific Mining Co. Inc. said it ""wishes to advise that it has no association with any Canadian based brokerage house, investment bank, or mining analyst, no Canadian based shareholders on its share register, nor is it planning to list on any Canadian stock exchange.""
Australian mining officials said earlier this week the Bre-X situation may not have happened if Canada had adopted mining reporting standards similar to Australia's.
Canada was the only country ""dragging its feet"" in efforts to have it and the United States, Australia, South Africa and Britain adopt a uniform reporting code, Norman Miskelly, head of an Australian industry reporting standards committee, told Reuters on Tuesday.
The OSC's Geller said he doubted Australian standards would have prevented a situation like Bre-X, but acknowledged they needed improvement.
""They are somewhat out of date and they are being brought up to date,"" he said.
Geller rejected criticism that fragmentation among Canada's provinces has made it difficult to get an agreement between the country's five stock exchanges and several securities commissions. Canada has tried for several years to set up one national securities commission.
Meanwhile, the negative impact on Canada's reputation as an international mining finance center will be short, some analysts predicted on Friday.
""Certainly there will be a sting, but Canadian institutions and markets were doing well before Bre-X and they will do well after Bre-X,"" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada in Toronto. ""That Australia is pointing the finger is more boosterism than anything else.""
Meanwhile, federal officials said there is no pressure for a federal inquiry into the Busang/Bre-X affair.
Canada's last major mining inquiry was a Royal Commission probe in the 1960s in which a mining promoter was jailed briefly for stock manipulation linked to worthless samples from a Northern Ontario drill site.
""There is absolutely no indication in any way that the federal government has started any investigation,"" said Dale Hull, a department of natural resources official.
"
48,"A monster shakeup of Canada's biggest city, Toronto, has sparked a citizens' revolt against Ontario's ruling Conservatives and raised eyebrows among those do business in the country's financial capital.
This clean, peaceful city -- sometimes dubbed ""New York run by the Swiss"" -- has recently become a battleground in the so-called ""Common Sense Revolution"" initiated by Ontario's Conservative Premier Mike Harris.
Promising leaner, cheaper government, Harris wants to merge Toronto and six neighbouring municipalities into a single ""megacity"" of 2.4 million people. The new city would hold about eight percent of Canada's 30 million people and dwarf all but three of Canada's 10 provinces.
Harris also plans a fundamental shift in how public services -- everything from education to welfare -- are delivered and paid for.
Opponents fear the municipal reform blitz will drive up taxes and lead to the kind of urban decay witnessed in many cities in the United States, just across the border.
The threat of such wrenching change being rammed through without a binding plebiscite has outraged citizens and prompted accusations of tyranny and fascism.
""Government is not elected for the politicians. It is elected by the people for the people,"" Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall told a crowd after residents in the seven affected areas voted three to one against a merger in a referendum last week.
The vote was not binding on Ontario's government, which has vowed to press ahead with its plan.
GOVERNMENT IS ADAMANT
The referendum capped a campaign which saw an Ontario cabinet minister likened to Adolf Hitler, bomb threats against a polling firm, and thousands of protesters marching in the streets in a re-enactment of a civic rebellion in 1837.
Harris has held firm. ""I don't think we can withdraw the need for change,"" he said, adding that there may be amendments when the legislation is introduced.
The ""megacity"" revolt has grabbed headlines across the country and overseas, even prompting some foreign consulates to keep a wary eye on the political wrangling.
""There is some interest, but it's purely because it has appeared in the (British) papers,"" said Terry Curran, the British Consul in Toronto.
Meanwhile, high-profile Canadian business leaders, politicians and artists have joined to oppose the merger plan.
They include film director Norman Jewison, Molson chief executive Norman Seagram, and writer Margaret Atwood who compared the megacity's architects to the Three Stooges.
The ""No"" side captured 75 percent of the votes in the referendum, but the process was flawed and turnout was low.
Under draft legislation, known as Bill 103, the seven city halls and 106 politicians who now govern the Greater Toronto Area will shrink to one elected mayor and 44 councillors.
The government also plans to overhaul property taxes, eliminate more than half of the province's school boards, seize control of education funding and download a bigger share of social programme costs onto the municipalities.
TAX FEARS
Harris has said the reforms are revenue neutral, but critics say municipalities may be forced to raise taxes.
They fear welfare rolls could soar and one of the hardest hit communities would be Toronto, which has a heavier welfare caseload and nearly half of the province's social housing.
""You're doing something that is very volatile and on a tax base which has very little flexibility,"" said George Fierheller, president of Toronto's Board of Trade.
More than 75 percent of the board's members favour reducing the size of government through a merger but nearly half worry about dumping such heavy responsibilities onto municipalities.
""As a Torontonian and a businessman responsible for a large company, I'm wary of abrupt change without making sure you've thought it through,"" said Peter Godsoe, chairman of Canada's fourth-largest bank, Bank of Nova Scotia.
The influential debt rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, has warned ""the very nature and scale of the reforms...create new challenges that could affect the credit quality of some municipalities.""
DOWNLOADING FEATURE OF GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS
The downloading trend has been a feature of government at all levels in Canada as they struggle with budget deficits.
Canada's ruling Liberal Party in Ottawa has dumped responsibility for public services on the provinces in recent federal budgets. Now the cash-strapped provinces are the doing the same to municipalities.
The autonomy of municipalities is severely restricted. They have the power to tax and legislate, but their powers are drawn from provincial law which can be changed by a majority vote in the legislature.
Ontario is in a tougher bind than most. Faced with a huge C$10 ($7.38) billion deficit when they came to power in 1995, the Conservatives slashed spending and cut the deficit to C$7.7 billion in 1996/97, while easing some taxes.
The Harris revolution has kept the government high in opinion polls, but public support has slipped recently, with backing for the Conservatives down to 37 percent in Metro Toronto, compared to 41 percent for the opposition Liberals.
""My sense is they cannot ignore the referendum results,"" said University of Toronto political scientist Graham White. ""Now that doesn't mean they will abandon the bill or even change it in a substantive way. There is not a lot of room for tinkering."" ($ = 1.354 Canadian Dollars)

48,"Three Canadian financial institutions on Tuesday launched North America's first city-wide, reusable ""smart"" card designed to replace cash in retail transactions.
The Exact card will be tested under a pilot programme operated by Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canada Trust, a unit of CT Financial Services Inc.
The project will be in Kingston, Ontario, city of about 100,000 people located 168 miles (270 km) northeast of Toronto.
About 600 Kingston merchants -- including convenience stores, gas stations and fast food outlets -- signed up with the test project.
The consortium is advertising Exact as an alternative to cash, credit and debit cards. Canadians currently spend between C$40 billion ($29 billion) and C$60 billion ($44 billion) using small coins and bills.
""With Exact you don't have to carry as many small bills and coins, and you'll always have the exact change required to make fast, convenient purchases,"" said Ron Hodge, vice president of card and direct services for TD Bank.
Canadians are among the biggest users of plastic cards in the world. They carry an estimated 46.2 million debt and credit cards, while use of these cards has jumped 43 percent in the past year, according to a recent industry survey.
""Technology is rapidly changing the face of money, providing faster, easier and more secure transactions. This is only the beginning,"" said Tim Hockey, vice president of core banking services for Canada Trust.
Exact will be followed in early 1997 by a community-wide test of Mondex, a rival ""smart"" card system developed in Britain. Exact is based on smart card technology developed by Belgium-based Banksys.
Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce will roll out their Mondex system in Guelph, a city of about 100,000 people 50 miles (80 kms) west of Toronto.
Both systems are similar in that they involve storing money on a computer chip embedded within a card. When a customer uses the card to make a purchase, the value is subtracted from the card.
Customers simply insert their card in the merchant's special, hand-held purchase terminal. The merchant enters the purchase price and the customer presses the ""OK"" button.
The electronic value of the sale is collected in the purchase terminal and transferred via telephone modem to the merchant's bank account at the end of the day.
Exact users can load, or electronically transfer cash from bank account to the card, up to C$200 ($147) from terminals in the Kingston branches of Bank of Montreal, TD Bank and Canada Trust. Load terminals will also be located in shopping malls, student campuses and selected stores.
The card will initally be offered at no charge. But after an introductory period, each financial institution will set a fee for its own customers.

48,"The Montreal Canadiens, the most storied franchise in the National Hockey League, were engulfed in sale rumours Friday, which drew a fierce denial from its owner, Molson Cos. Ltd.
Canadian newspapers reported that a consortium led by former Canadiens general manager and Hall of Famer Serge Savard was assembling a bid for the team, winner of a record 24 Stanley Cup championships since 1916.
Citing unidentified sources, Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper reported that talks with Molson had been under way for several days.
""Don't take this story lightly. There's a very good chance that it could happen,"" wrote sports columnist Marty York, quoting a source at Molson.
Rejean Tremblay, a columnist for the Montreal newspaper La Presse, reported similar rumours.
Molson is the sole owner of the Canadiens and their new arena, the $150 million Molson Centre. It also owns 40 percent of Canada's biggest brewer, Molson Breweries.
""The company has not approached anyone on this subject and no one has approached us. Neither the hockey club nor the Molson Centre are for sale,"" Molson Chief Executive Norman Seagram said in a statement.
Analysts speculated that the Canadiens and the arena could fetch up to $300 million.
Savard, who played for Montreal from 1967-1981 and was fired last season after 13 years as the team's general manager, was unavailable for comment on Friday.
Selling the Canadiens would be a dramatic about-face for Molson. The company said four months ago the club was a key part of its heritage.
""At the Molson companies, we have two legacy assets, Molson Breweries and the Montreal Canadiens,"" Seagram told shareholders at the annual meeting in June.
Sports plays a huge role in selling beer in Canada and the Molson name is intertwined with Canadiens hockey. Aside from putting its name on a new arena, Molson Breweries is a major sponsor of NHL television broadcasts in Canada.
The Molson family sold the club in 1971 to Peter Bronfman, whose cousins control the Seagram beverage empire. Molson Cos. reacquired the team in 1978.
Analysts said there had been no hint from Molson that it was interested in selling the club or arena.

48,"Toronto stocks soared to new heights on Wednesday, powered by a rally in bank shares as foreign investors stampeded into Canada's financial markets, lured by falling interest rates and a recovering Canadian economy.
Shares in Canada's big six banks hit 52-week highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, propelling the country's biggest stock market to its 53rd record close of 1996.
The Canadian dollar has also surged this week, hitting its strongest level since October 30, 1995.
Declining interest rates, low inflation and falling budget deficits have combined to make Canada the flavor of the month, economists said.
""Overall, foreign investors have just become enamored with Canada as a place for investment,"" Michael Gregory, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.
The Toronto Stock Exchange jumped 85 points to close around 5749, fueled by brisk action in interest-rate sensitive issues such as banks and utilities.
The key 300 Index has gained more than 20 percent this year, compared to about 19 percent for the Dow Jones Average and 16 percent for the Standard &amp; Poors 500.
The Bank of Canada is expected to ease interest rates again as early as this week. The central bank has cut rates 19 times since May 1995 in a bid to revive a sluggish economy.
Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said on Wednesday that Canada's improving economy gives the central bank more latitude to set Canadian rates independent of U.S. rates.
He added Canada is now in a better position to withstand a hike in U.S. rates than it has been in recent years.
""The economic outlook is favorable. We will soon see signs of the payoff for the difficult restructuring decisions taken in both the private and public sectors,"" Thiessen said.
After several years of belt tightening, Canadian governments have either balanced their budgets or are on track to wipe out huge deficits.
Canada's 1.2 percent inflation rate is one of the lowest in the world and less than half the U.S. rate.
Several Canadian banks cut residential mortgage rates on Wednesday to levels not seen in about three decades.
Gregory said he expected Canada to continue to outperform the United States on the rate front and that offshore investors recognized that. ""I think investors are coming to terms with the fact that Canadian interest rates -- because of low inflation and improving currency prospects -- should be below U.S. rates,"" he said.
""Many investors are jumping on that and the Canadian dollar is undervalued. It's cheap,"" Gregory said.
The Canadian currency closed around C$1.3312 (US$0.7512) on Wednesday after trading around C$1.3300 earlier in the session. The dollar broke through C$1.3300 on Tuesday, its strongest level since October 1995.
In stocks, the country's big six banks have been big beneficiaries of favorable interest rates and the overseas scramble to buy Canadian stocks.
The TSE's financial services group jumped 2.5 percent on Wednesday after soaring three percent on Tuesday. The sector has gained nearly 1,400 points since September.
Declining interest rates make bank lending more profitable and bank dividends more attractive for investors.
Soaring bank profits have also lured investors. The major banks report their year-end results in a few weeks and are on track for a third straight year of record profits.
Recent listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile in the United States where they are considered cheap compared to U.S. bank stocks.
New York-based Morgan Stanley issued a bullish recommendation on two Canadian banks on Tuesday and predicted a strong fourth quarter for the entire group.

48,"Veronika Hirsch, the flamboyant Canadian stock picker hired recently to spearhead Fidelity Investments' drive to dominate the Canadian market, has been removed from her fund as she is probed by Canadian regulators.
The dramatic move -- just three months after Canada's so-called ""Fund Diva"" joined the mutual fund giant -- is a blow to Fidelity's expansion efforts in Canada, analysts said.
Hirsch, who was unavailable to comment, is embroiled in a controversy over personal trades she made before joining Fidelity, the world's biggest mutual fund company.
Her investments earlier this year in a small Vancouver company, Oliver Gold Corp., grabbed headlines and attracted the attention of the British Columbia Securities Commission.
Late Wednesday, Fidelity ousted Hirsch from her portfolio and said her status was ""under discussion."" Fidelity also took the unprecedented step of offering clients their money back without penalty.
The fund has grown to C$190 million ($143 million) in assets since it was launched amid much fanfare on Sept. 23.
Fidelity's head office in Boston declined to comment and referred all calls to its Canadian subsidiary.
""We acknowledge that it is highly unusual for a fund to change portfolio managers so quickly after its launch. This fee recovery programme is a proactive and voluntary response on our part to maintain investors' goodwill,"" Fidelity Canada spokesman Chethan Lakshman told Reuters.
Fidelity vigorously defended Hirsch when the controversy first broke several weeks ago. But it cancelled a 27-city road show last week when regulators contacted Hirsch.
At issue is her purchase of 65,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold through a private placement while she was a fund manager with AGF Management Ltd. in Toronto.
Hirsch paid C$1.53 ($1.15) per warrant, according to filings with the British Columbia Securities Commission and reported by Stockwatch, a Canadian investment publication.
Shortly afterward, Hirsch's AGF Growth &amp; Income Fund bought 295,000 special warrants at more than double that price.
Analysts said regulators are expected to review whether the trades constitute ""front running"", a practice whereby a fund manager tries to profit personally by buying securities he or she intends to buy later for the fund.
Another related issue is whether Hirsch, a resident of Ontario, used an address in British Columbia to buy the Oliver Gold shares, which were only offered to B.C. residents.
Lakshman contended the controversy has not damaged Fidelity's reputation or expansion plans in Canada. But analysts saw the publicity as damaging as Fidelity gears up for the critical year-end sale of retirement savings plans.
""They look kind of foolish being the ones associated with this situation. I don't think it helps their bid to become the dominant player in Canada by any stretch of the imagination,"" one industry analyst said.
The Hirsch case comes as Canadians are pouring billions of dollars into mutual funds. Over the last six years, investment has jumped seven-fold to C$180 billion ($136 billion).
Fidelity wants a bigger share of the Canadian market, where it ranks ninth with C$7 billion ($5.2 billion) in assets, behind leader Investors Group, with C$22 billion ($16 million).
To quarterback its effort in Canada, Fidelity poached Hirsch, a high-profile stock picker with AGF, for a rumoured C$2 million ($1.5 million) signing bonus in August.
Her meteoric rise to celebrity status began when she joined AGF in October 1995 after a successful but low-profile stint at Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
A multi-million advertising campaign put Hirsch's face on television screens across the country. She soon rivalled celebrity stock guru Frank Mersch at Altamira Management Ltd. as the country's best-known fund manager.
When Hirsch jumped to Fidelity, her blood-red nails and leather outfits appeared an uncomfortable fit with Fidelity's ultra-conservative culture, but the hiring was considered a major coup within the industry.
At the time, Fidelity Canada President Kevin Kelly said: ""Veronika is one of the country's top equity managers with an outstanding track record and reputation.""
Kelly was unavailable for comment on Thursday.
Industry critics argue that the Hirsch case raises key questions about the fiduciary responsibility of fund managers to their clients. It also highlights the jumble of standards governing the personal investing of Canadian money managers.
Altamira has tough rules restricting managers from investing in open-ended mutual funds, short-term government bonds and treasury bills after a controversy involving one of its fund managers.
But some industry observers say the entire industry should adopt tougher U.S. guidelines.
"
48,"Shivering icewine enthusiasts, battered by icy winds, headed into a snow-covered vineyard on a recent night to harvest one of the world's rarest wines.
Although Germany discovered the luscious dessert wine in the late 18th century, Canada is the world's largest producer of icewine -- capturing many international awards and helping shed an industry reputation for screw-top plonk that neither amuses nor has any pretentions.
If you can find it, this ""liquid gold"" can cost up to C$200 ($150) a bottle in icewine-crazy Japan -- four times the price in Canada. Japan is by far the biggest export market, but China and South Korea are also developing a taste for it.
But on this cold winter night a cup of piping hot coffee could fetch a better price than any chilled wine. ""It's cold, hard work. You're outside in the dark picking frozen grapes and wondering why you're not asleep like normal people,"" Greg Berti, general manager of Hillebrand Estates Winery, said on a recent midnight tour of Hillebrand's icewine fields.
Most of the Canadian vintage comes from the Niagara wine region where 24 wineries produced 29,700 gallons (112,500 liters) in 1995. That is up 57 percent from 1994 but paltry compared to the eight million gallons (30 million liters) of regular wine produced yearly in Ontario, Canada's most populous province.
Some California wineries produce sweet wines but they are shunned by icewine purists because the grapes are artificially frozen. ""Their wine is interesting, but it's not in the same league as icewine,"" Berti said.
IT MAY BE RARE BUT IT TASTES LIKE PEACHES
Although Niagara wineries say their products are unique in taste, icewine is generally amber or golden in colour with a full-flavored taste similar to honey, apricots or peaches. It is thicker than regular wine, with an alcohol content of about 10 percent, compared to 40 percent for a cognac or brandy.
Canada exports icewine to Germany, Denmark, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and Korea are also emerging markets. But the biggest buyers are Japanese tourists who flock to the Niagara region by the busload -- snapping up several bottles of icewine after a visit to nearby Niagara Falls.
Hillebrand sells about 75 percent of its icewine to Japanese who tour its winery. ""Their image of Canada is Banff, Anne of Green Gables and Niagara Falls, and icewine fits in with that image,"" Berti said.
Last summer, a group of 74 Japanese race horse owners descended on another Niagara winery and drove off with more than $10,000 worth of icewine. ""They came into the winery, sampled, bought and were back in their bus in 45 minutes,"" recalled Debi Pratt, director of public relations for Inniskillin Wines Inc.
ALMOST AS HARD TO PRODUCE AS GOLD
It takes every grape from an entire vine to yield enough juice to make one bottle of icewine -- 10 times the amount used to make regular wines. Many grapes are lost to hungry birds, hail or harsh winter winds before they are picked.
But Canada has plenty of what is needed most to make icewine -- consistently cold weather.
The grapes -- hardy Vidal or Riesling varieties -- must be picked off the vine when temperatures are well below freezing.
Most wineries set aside part of their vineyards in October when the regular wine harvest ends. By mid-December or early January the shriveled grapes have turned a brownish hue and pickers are on call, waiting for the right weather.
Berti said Mother Nature has sometimes forced crews to pick on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve -- although that did not happen this year.
""The wind is the biggest problem. Every hour or half hour we take a break for hot coffee and donuts,"" Gregory Synos, a six-year veteran of the icewine harvest, said.
The grapes are sorted and rushed to the winery where presses work into the night. The juice then goes through several weeks of fermentation, followed by a few months of ageing in oak barrels to smooth out the acidity and tanins in immature icewine.
Although Hillebrand has tried to modernise the process by using special presses and protective netting for the grapes, Berti conceded: ""There is nothing efficent about it. You have to get into the fields when the getting is good.""

48,"Shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd. dominated the actives list on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday as exchange officials said problems that have hampered recent trading in the stock were now fixed.
Bre-X finished its first full session since last week on the TSE -- Canada's biggest stock market -- closing down C25 cents at C$3.18 in massive turnover of eight million shares. On Nasdaq, Bre-X fell 25 cents to $2.375.
The stock earlier hit a session high of C$3.78 amid market rumors that early test results of the Busang gold site by an independent mining consultant looked positive.
""I heard it was rumors around Strathcona that got them up today, but those rumors petered out so that's why it is down,"" one analyst said.
Toronto-based mining consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. has remained silent since it was hired two weeks ago by Bre-X to conduct an audit of the Busang gold site.
The final results of Strathcona's review are not expected until early May.
Bre-X has been under siege since last week when its partner in Indonesia, New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., revealed that early drilling samples performed during its due diligence process on the Busang gold property in the rain forests of Borneo turned up only tiny amounts of gold.
Frantic trading in Bre-X shares forced the TSE to stop trading in the stock on Thursday -- the third time this week that the TSE halted Bre-X because of heavy order volumes and an outdated computer system.
TSE President Rowland Fleming said on Friday that the exchange fixed the problem by rewriting a section of computer code.
""(It was) easily rectified. I'm confident we will not (have any more problems),"" Fleming told Reuters.
He dismissed suggestions that the TSE's reputation had been tarnished by the trading interruptions. ""Every exchange from time to time with this kind of sophisticated technology has difficulties,"" Fleming said.
He said the TSE was cooperating with the Ontario Securities Commission, which confirmed on Thursday that it has launched a probe into whether Bre-X violated insider trading and disclosure laws.
Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh, his wife and other company officials added more than C$37 million ($26.6 million) to their bank accounts after they sold Bre-X stock at prices ranging from C$24.40 ($17.57) to C$28.40 ($20.45) between August and October.
The sales were controversial because they occurred shortly after Bre-X learned that its preliminary license had been canceled by the Indonesian government, a development the company did not reveal publicly until last October.
""Mr. Walsh and all of the others...are perfectly entitled to buy and sell their stock as they see fit, and make money or lose money as the case may be, as long as they do not do that using insider information,"" Fleming said.
He said there was no evidence to date that Bre-X officials had acted improperly.

48,"A top Indonesian mining official said on Tuesday that the recent battle over the huge Busang gold deposit has caused some uncertainty among foreign investors in Indonesia.
""We realize...that successes in the mineral sector were overshadowed by the Busang controversy which caused some uncertainty within the international mining community and questions (about) the integrity of Indonesia's mining policy, particularly with regard to the security of foreign investment,"" Rozik B. Soetjipto, head of mining industry development at Indonesia's Directorate General of Mines, told a mining conference in Toronto.
The Busang deposit was the subject of an intense bidding war with several mining companies trying to woo the Indonesian government to take control of possibly the biggest gold find of the century. Busang contains at least 71 million ounces of gold, valued at about US$25 billion.
He said the Indonesian government was working to improve the contract of work (COW) system, but Soetjipto added foreign companies also have to do a better job of understanding the country's mining policy.
""If you are looking to invest or explore in Indonesia, then you have to be sure that you have a contract of work. As long as you have the contract, you are secure to do the exploration and investment,"" he told reporters after delivering a speech to the Prospectors &amp; Developers Association of Canada annual convention.
Although finding a local partner is not necessary to do business in Indonesia, Soetjipto said: ""In some cases it might be better to have a local partner to know how to do business in Indonesia because it's a different culture (and) that has created problems.""
Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp initially dominated the negotiations for control of Busang, which was discovered by Calgary-based prospector and Bre-X Minerals Ltd.
But Barrick's inside track ended when the government of President Suharto brought in Indonesian businessman Muhammad ""Bob"" Hasan in January.
Hasan subsequently brokered a deal that gave New Orleans-based Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc 15 percent of Busang and the right to mine the deposit. The arrangement left Bre-X with 45 percent and the rest to the Indonesian government and to two Indonesian companies.
Bre-X's shares have been under pressure amid investor confusion over the company's stake in Busang. Bre-X has said the company did not originally own 90 percent of the discovery and investors were mistaken to believe otherwise.
Bre-X and its partners are waiting for the Indonesian government to issue a contract of work before mine construction can begin. Bre-X has said a contract of work is expected during March.
Bre-X's stock fell 0.25 to close at 17.75 on 716,000 shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

0,"London-based international bank HSBC Holdings Plc on Monday posted a 23 percent rise in 1996 profits but chief executive John Bond predicted a challenging year ahead with increasing competition.
Despite the prospect of tougher conditions, Bond said the banking group, which is one of the biggest in the world, had a strong capital position and a balance sheet that made it ready to meet competition head-on.
""We see 1997 as a challenging year wherever we look, whether it be Asia or the UK the competition continues to increase,"" Bond said in an interview.
Earlier, HSBC announced a 23 percent rise in pretax profits for 1996 to 4.52 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) -- around the middle of market expectations. A hefty nine pence per share rise in annual dividend to 41 pence bettered most forecasts.
Bond said HSBC's British unit Midland Bank would continue to grow organically as the price of acquisitions was impossible to justify to shareholders.
Midland put in a strong performance with pretax profits up more than 20 percent and costs held to a rise of less than one percent.
Bond said HSBC's capital ratios were strong, with tier one capital rising to 9.9 percent from 9.5 percent at the end of 1995. He did not see surplus capital being generated.
""As long as we're making a respectable return on capital, we regard capital strength as an asset in our business,"" Bond said. ""It helps you with the ratings, it helps with deposits in Asia and to have a strong capital position shows in the bottom line.""
HSBC had a 21.3 percent return on capital in 1996 compared with 20.7 percent in 1995.
Bond said HSBC continued to be confident about Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese rule in July.
Last year, HSBC was granted a licence to trade in the Chinese yuan and Bond said the bank was talking to the Chinese authorities to see how this would work in practice.
Bond said HSBC was looking at this massive potential business opportunity in the long term.
""I think it will take time, of course it will, but the signs are all positive.""
He said the rise of sterling against the dollar had not had a great effect on the group's results in 1996 where the average rate for the pound against the dollar was below that of 1995.
But he said that, very roughly, for every cent the pound goes up against the dollar, the bank loses 13 million pounds in profit. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

0,"Just when they thought their strategy had been accepted by the market, British banks which are heavily involved in investment banking, are seeing their policy fundamentally questioned again.
Barclays and NatWest, who both have aspirations to build global investment banks to compete with the ""bulge-bracket"" Wall Street firms, have had a tough month.
First, BZW, the Barclays unit, posted a massive 29 percent fall in profits for 1996 -- a year which, especially in the bond markets, saw large profits for the big American houses.
Barclays' chief executive Martin Taylor, who has staked a lot on dragging BZW into the top league, vigorously defended the large cash injection into the investment bank.
""You have to be careful not to be frightened of your own shadow,"" he told Reuters in an interview last month. ""The reason that the returns are depressed this year is that we're spending so much,"" adding that BZW would be weaker without the investment.
Taylor has brought in some big and expensive names, like Bill Harrison of Flemings, to lead BZW through its next development stage but the markets may be running out of patience.
Meanwhile, at NatWest Markets, which has followed an acquisitive strategy over the past year, reputation and morale has suffered a direct hit from a stunning 90 million pound ($142.8 million) loss on derivatives.
This laid bare problems of control in what had been considered a tight ship steered by chief executive Martin Owen.
Owen has publicly admitted that the affair has holed NatWest Markets but only ""above the waterline"".
Its strategy was already being questioned before the derivatives debacle in much the same terms as that of BZW -- that it was buying units to bolt onto its core at the height of the market cycle.
Compared to banks like Lloyds TSB, firmly entrenched in a UK bancassurance strategy, analysts question how investment banking will add to shareholder value.
Panmure Gordon banking analyst David Poutney has described the banks' commitment to investment banking as ""lemming-like"" and the returns from the business as ""paltry"".
Analysts are dismayed at the commitment to cost growth in the investment banks but have been reassured that both are making continuing strides in restructuring and reprofiling their retail business though this is likely to become even more fiercely competitive in the near-term,.
At the moment, the jury still seems to be out but one analyst, who declined to be named, said the market will probably give BZW and NatWest Markets a couple of years to start showing what they can do.
The danger is that the market cycle could be against them.
""They have taken on a lot of staff and invested and acquired at the top of the cycle,"" the analyst said. ""If the market correction which people have been predicting happens in the second half of this year it will mean that profits will be hard to come by in 1997 and 1998.""
Already, rumours circulate that Barclays is looking to unload BZW and concentrate on improving the already highly respectable return produced by the retail banking side. But the bank dismisses this talk.
However, Panmure's Poutney said in a recent note, ""(A sale or demerger) would be massively bullish, and cynics who share our view should buy the shares.""
After nailing their colours so firmly to the investment banking mast, Taylor and Wanless would have a lot of explaining to do if they came, belatedly, to the same conclusion that Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Brian Pitman has been expounding for years.
Pitman has never liked the cyclical nature of investment banking profits and has presided over a stunning performance by Lloyds TSB which has better returns than any UK retail bank.
""Soon, people are going to demand a pay-back from all this investment,"" said another banking analyst. ""When that happens, there had better be some good answers or the market will not like it."" ($ = 0.630 British Pounds)

0,"Banking analysts said on Monday they were positive on implications for Bank of Scotland in its joint venture into supermarket banking with J Sainsbury, with one analyst even upgrading his recommendation.
Others maintained their positive stances on the Scottish bank and played down the negative impact the innovative plan would have on the rest of the retail financial services sector.
""The Sainsbury move is a confirmation of Bank of Scotland's strategy of alternative distribution into England,"" Goldman Sachs banking analyst David Townshend said.
Goldman Sachs and BZW reiterated their positive stances on the group while SBC Warburg upgraded its recommendation on the stock to ""trading buy"" from ""hold,"" market sources said.
Bank of Scotland's link with Sainsbury is seen giving the bank a boost in the British market. The move is expected to help the bank enlarge its small retail customer base in England and find a new outlet for its range of financial services, which it can sell through its excellent technological infrastructure.
Bank of Scotland's low-cost operation could mean Sainsbury's Bank could offer a better rate to depositors than customers currently get through retail store group Tesco's link with National Westminster Bank, BZW said in a research note. Tesco currently offers five percent on deposits.
But even so, analysts doubted existing banks will lose many accounts to Sainsbury's Bank, which is due to begin trading in the first half of next year.
""I don't see a material threat of switching,"" said Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley.
Analysts said there is a certain amount of inertia in the banking market and many consumers already have more than one account so they could easily take on a Sainsbury account without necessarily closing their more conventional one.
Some also noted that British banks, with already large customer bases, were addressing different problems.
A lack of customers is not the problem for Barclays or Lloyds, said Tim Sykes, banking analyst at BZW.
""These banks don't have the same need,"" Sykes said, ""The thing they want to achieve is to sell more of their products to their existing customers.""
Most British banks have moved heavily into ""bancassurance"" style operations in recent years, offering a wide range of lending, investment and insurance products.
Plain banks are also still seen as having an advantage in terms of the ""horses for courses"" argument. Analysts said many customers prefer a more traditional approach.
While telephone banking has grown quickly in popularity in recent years, for example, the vast majority of bank customers still prefer having a ""normal"" account although seemingly few visit their branch very regularly.

0,"National Westminster Bank Plc on Tuesday reported a jump in operating profit but the bank's shares dipped after it warned of an economic slowdown in 1998 and did not perform an expected share repurchase.
Underlying profit rose by 27 percent and NatWest, one of Britain's biggest banks, said the headline profits figure was hit by one-off items.
Profit before tax was 1.12 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) after exceptional items, with operating profit from continuing operations up by 339 million to 1.61 billion pounds.
The bank said it expected the pace of  British economic growth to slow in 1998, however, and as a consequence was adopting a more cautious approach to lending.
""We don't want people to get carried away by 3.5 percent (economic ) growth this year which is what me might still see,"" NatWest chief executive Derek Wanless told Reuters in an interview.
""Our belief is that whoever wins the election, rates will rise and the fiscal position could well be tighter.""
He added that NatWest was putting the lending policies in place now for people who will be paying back in that economic climate.
Wanless said NatWest expected British base rates to rise to 7-1/4 percent by the end of the year compared to their current six percent level.
NatWest increased its general provisions against bad debts by 50 million pounds and made specific provisions of 499 million pounds.
Analysts said the market would be disappointed that NatWest had not performed a further repurchase of shares following its 451 million pounds buyback last July.
Wanless said NatWest will perform further share repurchases if it generates more surplus capital.
Some analysts had expected NatWest to use its remaining shareholder authority to buy back 28 million shares which would have cost it some 220 million pounds but the bank made no announcement.
""If we've got surplus capital we will return it to shareholders,"" Wanless said. ""That's still the policy and will remain the policy.""
He said NatWest would ask shareholders to return its buy-back mandate to 100 million shares at its AGM in April but declined to give any clues on when a repurchase might actually be performed.
NatWest's pre-tax profit figure came after a loss of 719 million pounds on sale of businesses such as its U.S. banking operation Bancorp, costs of 186 million on the redesign of its UK retail bank and a gain of 224 million on the sale of its stake in venture capital company 3i.
Pre-tax profits at NatWest Markets, its investment banking arm, rose to 462 million pounds from 304 million, although this included a fall in bad debt provisions to 18 million pounds from 114 million.
Wanless said the group would not bid in the auction currently under way for mutually-owned life insurer Scottish Amicable but added that it was still on the look out to bolster its operations in the area of long-term savings.
Wanless said NatWest UK saw a six percent rise in income and a two percent fall in costs despite the fact that it was spending large amounts on new systems.
He said an additional 100 million pounds would be spent on this in 1997.
NatWest is paying a final dividend of 19.4 pence, raising the total for the year by 14.6 percent to 29.0p.
By 1130 GMT, NatWest shares were 25-1/2 pence lower at 787 having rallying from a low earlier of 762. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)

0,"Britain's securities market watchdog said on Tuesday it had disciplined former Barings executive James Bax -- completing the cases of managers blamed for the bank's collapse.
Barings went bust in February 1995 under the weight of some 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) of losses racked up in unauthorised derivatives trades by trader Nick Leeson, currently languishing in a Singapore jail.
The SFA started proceedings against nine former senior executives of Barings but did not proceed against Peter Baring and Andrew Tuckey, chairman and deputy chairman respectively of Barings group.
The nine were former chief executive Peter Norris, Ron Baker, Bax, Geoff Broadhust, Tony Gamby, Tony Hawes, Ian Hopkins, George Maclean and Mary Walz.
Of these nine, only Hopkins and Baker have any outstanding business with the SFA.
After its spectacular collapse, Barings was taken over by Dutch financial services group Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV and now operates as ING Barings.
The spotlight now turns to Britain's Department of Trade which this week confirmed it has started legal proceedings which could ban the Barings nine plus Tuckey from being directors of any British company for up to 15 years.
The DTI said it would hold preliminary hearings and then would set a timetable for a final hearing of the cases.
And as if that wasn't enough, Norris, Tuckey, Baker, Walz, Hopkins, Gamby, Broadhurst and Bax also face writs from accountancy firm Cooper's &amp; Lybrand in third party proceedings after it was sued by Barings administrator Ernst &amp; Young for what is thought to be around 1.0 billion pounds.
Hopkins was recently banned for three years from being a director in the City and required to pay 10,000 pounds of costs. Though technically he is still able to appeal against his sentence, he is thought unlikely to do so.
Meanwhile, Baker, who as head of financial products played a central role in the Barings affair, is appealing against a reprimand handed out to him in November even though more serious charges had not been proved.
Baring and Tuckey left Barings after giving assurances that they would never seek top management jobs in the financial markets.
Penalties handed out to the others have ranged from reprimands to three year bans with costs of up to 10,000 pounds.
Bax was suspended from being a City director for 21 months and will also pay costs of 10,000 pounds after the SFA found some mitigating circumstances for his conduct.
The SFA said it had taken into account, among other matters, that Bax had no product responsibility for the trading activities of Leeson nor any knowledge of futures and options trading.
Bax's suspension will run from March 1996, the date when the SFA started proceedings against him.

0,"Britain's Woolwich Building Society, which will float on the stock exchange this summer, said on Wednesday its pretax profit rose by 18 percent to a record 392 million pounds ($629.5 million) in 1996.
Woolwich chief executive John Stewart said he wanted to see growth in all the company's businesses following its conversion into a listed company.
While its net mortgage lending jumped 50 percent to 1.4 billion pounds, the society said its administrative expenses rose by less than one percent and its cost-to-income ratio edged down to 45.8 percent from 48.9 percent.
Stewart said that if draft building societies legislation were passed in its current form, the Woolwich would have to consider expansion by acquisition very carefully.
This is because in its current form the law would take away a building society's five-year immunity from takeover if it takes over another financial sector company.
""If the bill is passed in its present form, it would make us think twice about acquisitions,"" Stewart said. ""We would have to weigh the strategic importance of the acquisition against the loss of protection.""
But Stewart added that, whatever the legislation, the Woolwich would be ""out there doing business"".
The Woolwich had an excellent record not only in organic growth but also in joint ventures and cold starts. ""We have a lot more clubs in our bag, there are a lot more ways to develop the business if we have to think twice about making an acquisition,"" he said.
The Woolwich, which will be quoted in the FTSE 100 index after flotation and is Britain's third largest building society, sees itself as a low-cost provider.
Stewart said he wanted costs to get even lower. ""We think we're efficient, we've got a track record of reducing our cost-to-income ratio and we're not finished, by no means,"" he said.
The Woolwich wanted to increase its business in areas such as unit trusts, life and general insurance and in the core mortgage business and personal loans.
He said he especially wanted to see growth in its French and Italian companies -- Banque Woolwich and Banca Woolwich -- which he said were already doing well.
Asked if Woolwich would grow organically in Europe, Stewart said, ""Oh no, it may well be by acquisition, if the right one comes along.""

0,"The British government on Wednesday published new draft legislation governing home lending institutions but a lack of parliamentary time might mean it will not reach the statute book before a general election.
The Building Societies Bill, if passed, would remove a society's five-year immunity from takeover once it converts to bank status if it, in turn, took over another financial institution.
Immunity would not be affected by one of the new banks buying mortgage books or by joint ventures, however.
The draft received a mixed reception from the four societies currently planning to convert themselves into banks.
A Treasury spokeswoman admitted that there was currently no slot for the bill in the Parliamentary agenda but added it remained hopeful an opportunity could arise in the New Year.
""The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want,"" said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement. ""When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.""
The Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($49.97 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government has not taken into account its ""serious concerns"" on the timing of the draft.
""Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,"" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.
If the bill was enacted, she said the Woolwich board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.
In contrast the Northern Rock, also planning a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.
""We are delighted with it,"" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. ""It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you cant ask for more than that.""
The Building Societies Association also welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.
BSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's ""thoughtful compromise"" on the question of takeover protection.
Under current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.
Some societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.
""We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,"" the Treasury said.
The Halifax, the country's biggest home lender has already waived its right to takeover protection by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary.
The mutually-owned building societies have traditionally been the largest mortgage lenders in Britain although in recent years, commercial banks have taken some market share. ($1=.6003 Pound)

0,"Sir Chippendale ""Chips"" Keswick who, it was announced on Wednesday, will take over the chair of Hambros, one of the few remaining British independent investment banks, has been regarded by some as an outsider.
The firm has been dominated by the Hambro family but Keswick, 56, has over 30 years under his belt at the bank where he will fill both the chairman's and chief executive roles from July next year. He can hardly be called a complete outsider.
Nevertheless, it will be the first time in the bank's history that a Hambro has not occupied the chair.
That history is a long one, dating back to 1839 in London and back into the 18th century and its Danish origins.
Universally known as ""Chips"", Keswick is a member of the family which controls the Jardine group of companies in the Far East. He was born in Shanghai in 1940 and attended Eton College completing his studies at a French university.
After a few years with Glynn Williams, Keswick joined Hambros Bank in 1965. He became chairman of the bank in 1986, vice-chairman of the group in the same year and chief executive last year.
Keswick is known as a private person who is much more at home talking about the business than about himself.
Married with three sons, Keswick is a non-executive director of the Bank of England as well as of De Beers Consolidated Mines, Anglo American and British housebuilder Persimmon.
He lists his pastimes as bridge and field sports.
Keswick, who takes over from Charles, Lord Hambro, chairman since 1983, has been involved with the bank during some recently troubled times.
Hambros had appeared to lose its way, not following its peers into the competitive world of modern investment banking but still managing to make losses.
Ironically, along with a few others, it has managed to remain independent while other names such as S.G. Warburg, Kleinwort Benson, Barings and Morgan Grenfell have fallen into the hands of foreign parents.
Some observers would remark that Hambros wasn't worth buying but those people are beginning to feel that Hambros' new strategy of concentrating on its core banking and investment management businesses could be the way forward.
Keswick says he is confident of the strategy and is unlikely to be be aloof from the business.
""Chips will inevitably be a hands-on chairman,"" one of his senior colleagues said.

0,"Fund management Group Mercury Asset management will make acquisitions if it can enhance shareholder value, its chairman Hugh Stevenson said on Tuesday after announcing bumper profits and a sharp jump in its cash pile.
Profits rose 29 percent to 81.8 million stg from 63.6 million stg in the first half last year while cash rose to 261.6 million stg from 189.9 million at the end of March.  
Asked if MAM was considering a U.S. acquisition, Stevenson said: ""The U.S. is obviously an extremely important market, it's the biggest savings market in the world but value for our shareholders is the main aim.""
Stevenson said an acquisition which enhanced this value would have to be considered.
On the cash pile, Stevenson said that the company prefers a conservative balance sheet.
""Cash has risen materially in the last six months,"" Stevenson said.  
""It's a question of a balance between a prudent balance sheet and returning value in the form of dividends to shareholders. We've had a very progressive dividend policy over recent years.""
Stevenson said the rise in the interim dividend to 10 pence per share from six pence last time reflected a desire to rebalance the interim and final payout.
He was unsure if this rebalancing was complete given the uncertainty of how the full year will turn out.  
Stevenson refused to comment on the state of world equity markets and thus the company's prospects for the second half, ""We tend to reserve comments on the markets for our clients.""
But in a statement earlier, he said the firm was determined to create value through profitable expansion notwithstanding short-term market movements.
MAM again showed that it is not missing its tie to former owner S.G. Warburg which was cut when the latter was gobbled up by Swiss Bank Corp last year.  
Stevenson said the first half had been positive with funds under management rising to 85.9 billion stg from 70.9 billion at the same point last year and 81 billion at the end of March.
The current figure included 2.0 billion stg of net new business which was lower than the 2.5 billion stg seen in the second half of last year.
He said it was too early to tell what effect problems at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, where alleged irregularities are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, might have on the industry in the longer term.
""It's a growth industry,"" Stevenson said, ""and it continues to grow. The UK market is changing and we have been doing more in defined contribution business.""
About two thirds of MAM's business is in the institutional pension fund management area, 20 percent for investors overseas and the rest for private investors.
Costs continued to rise but were more than matched by revenue growth.
Stevenon said the rise reflected the consolidation of its Australian subsidiary; large investment in systems and infrastructure; and the coyly termed ""higher provision for variable remuneration"", otherwise known as bonuses. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.

0,"What would a bank do if it woke up one morning and found that all its customers were dead?
Hopefully it would realise that it was Jan. 1, 2000, but, more hopefully still, it will have taken action to make sure the turn of the century does not turn out to be the biggest computer disaster ever.
It takes something like the ""millennium bug"" to make people even think about how dependent most of us are on the internal workings of the financial system.
Doomsday scenarios of what the bug might do go as far as to predict the destruction of the financial system. It's not really a bug at all but purely the fact that up to now computers have represented the date year in two digits rather than four.
Needless to say, bankers and information technology experts deny any possibility of this with the British banking system insisting it will be ""millennium-compatible"" by the end of 1998 -- leaving a year for any last minute tweaking.
Though when questioned about specifics, the answers start to take on a worrying vagueness akin to that seen when they are asked about their preparations for European monetary union (EMU).
Left unresolved, computers might treat the date Jan. 1, 2000 as Jan. 1, 1900 and if asked to calculate the period between 1995 and 2000 would then come up with the answer ""minus 95 years"" -- not much use to anyone and potentially dangerous.
Britain's major banks are busily trying to solve the problem and one of the biggest, NatWest, said recently that it will spend as much as 100 million British pounds ($163 million) over the next couple of years to get its systems in line.
One of the complications in banking and finance is that none of the computer systems work in isolation, they all have to interrelate extensively with systems in other banks and in other companies and with the clearing and payments systems.
Indeed, the problems have already started, with computers in stores refusing to recognise credit cards with an expiry date after the end of 1999.
""The main issue that has emerged is that banks are so reliant on each other,"" said Will Mason of the British Bankers' Association (BBA). ""There is work going on to develop standards for people using networks to be compatible.""
In Britain, the BACS (bankers' automated clearing system) receives inputs from all sorts of companies. The system processes salary checks and the payment of bills and dividends, for example.
Banks have to be sure corporate customers using this system have their own systems in order and this must all be done by the end of 1998 to leave time for last-minute changes.
Investment banking is, if anything, even more susceptible to date problems as nearly every transaction will carry a value date or involve the difference in price or interest rate between two dates. The potential for problems is huge.
""The problem is that you're likely to get something that doesn't work properly rather than doesn't work at all,"" Mason said. ""Which is even worse.""
Banks are finding the task of altering their systems a highly detailed piece of work. They have to find out what the system will do in a highly complex series of transactions and then make it do the right thing. They often are using already existing back-up systems to test what might happen on their main system.
Among other wrinkles that are becoming apparent is that users have been using the date field in a programme to denote things other than just a specific date.
If for example, loans have no fixed term, this may have been denoted by using ""99"" in the date box or dead customers may have been denoted by using ""00.""
When we get there, the system will kill off all the customers.
A lot of systems in banking are relatively old. They have lasted a lot longer than was originally expected and are often written in computer languages that are no longer much used.

18,"Ivorian 1996/97 cocoa arrivals stood at around 390,000-410,000 tonnes by mid-December, after a slow start to the month, analysts and exporters say.
Exporters blamed a combination of crop profile and demand factors for the dip in December -- usually the strongest month.
The figures to December 16 were down from an estimated 540,000 tonnes by that date last year, but some analysts said a further 50,000 tonnes should be added to this year's total for comparative purposes as the season had opened three weeks late.
An averaged figure plus the 50,000 tonnes would put arrivals since October 1 at 450,000. Various sources put arrivals at San Pedro since October 1 at 130,000-140,000 tonnes with the rest going to the main port of Abidjan.
""Arrivals were slower than usual for December but in the past week arrivals have overtaken last year's (weekly) rate,"" said one exporter. ""People are completing December contracts but January will be strong,"" he added.
Subsequent arrivals up to December 22 were said by exporters to be around 50,000 tonnes per week. They expected the deficit in arrivals compared to last year to grow in December before narrowing sharply in January, when arrivals pick up again.
Difficulty in obtaining export contracts from the Caistab marketing board and problems with bean drying after rains upcountry had accentuated the usual Christmas period drop-off.
Rains had damaged bushtracks, delaying collection and raising humidity and moisture to above acceptable levels in some areas.
""We are refusing some cocoa. There is a lot more coming down now the sun is out,"" said one Abidjan-based exporter.
Drying problems and poor fermentation had raised bean humidity to 11 percent in some areas, extending both normal and machine drying times.
""Humidity levels are slipping back down from anything up to 11 percent,"" said one San Pedro-based buyer, and the guideline farmgate price of 315 CFA per kilo had on the whole been paid to growers.
Upcountry buyers visited by Reuters over Christmas had taken the chance to dry out large quantities of fresh through to greyish moist beans as a wet early December gave way to usual dry sunny weather ahead of the holiday.
""It's patchy, but sunny days are here again,"" said one buyer. ""Whatever was cut off in village stores or too wet can now be properly dried out,"" he added.
San Pedro received over 15,000 in the week from December 16, exporters there said.
Reports of smuggling to Guinea continue to surface but one Western diplomat recently returning by road from Conakry said road conditions were appalling and few covered trucks had been seen.
Large shipments in the past weeks are expected to cut into port stocks.
""Port area stocks are unclear but there are a lot of bulk shipments,"" said one exporter.

18,"Heavy wet season rains in April favouring Ivorian cocoa midcrop growth (May-Sept) dropped off in early May but harvests are expected to match forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes, weather and crop analysts said on Thursday.
""Nothing much has really changed,"" said one crop analyst returning from upcountry and referring to favourable pod growth and flowering seen in early April. ""The development seems to be coming along quite nicely.""
Official weather data for the first 10 days of May totalled 292.6 mm against 789.2 mm in the previous 10 days.
Wet season rains, which arrived in April, are expected to peak in June before small dry season conditions in July and August.
Steady June rains would favour pod growth and bean sizes and help propel harvest volumes toward preliminary crop analyst mid-crop forecasts of between 150,000-200,000 tonnes.
""I would have hoped for a bit more soil moisture,"" said one crop analyst. Another said levels were around average for the time of year.
Early May rains were concentrated north of main cocoa growing areas, with a total of 338 mm falling around Odienne, Bouake and Bondoukrou, and are not included in the above data.
Ivory Coast produced a bumper 200,000 tonnes mid-crop in its record 1.2 million tonnes harvest year (Oct-Sept). This year's main crop (Oct-April) was close to one million tonnes when the season closed at the end of last month.
The latest data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of May in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed):
Daloa 44.4 (21.8), Gagnoa 12.0 (62.7), San Pedro 1.3 (49.4), Tabou 60.5 (95.4) Man 33.3 (12.5), Dimbokro 39.7 (41.8), Yamoussoukro 34.6 (69.0), Abidjan 35.1 (221.2), Sassandra 0 (154.7), Adiake 27.1 (51.7), Korhogo 4.6 (9.0).

18,"Ivory Coast is destroying some cocoa farms in its protected forests but the impact on 1996/97 (October-September) output will be minimal as officials await clear eviction plans, forestry officials and crop analysts say.
""Nothing has really been done,"" said one state forest agency (SODEFOR) manager.
""We are told to get them (farmers) out but we are waiting for practical policies on the way to go ahead,"" south coast area manager Tanoh Yao told Reuters during a recent tour of protected forests.
Ivory Coast said in March that 30 percent of protected forests were ""illegally occupied"" by up to 450,000 farmers and their relatives, growing up to 100,000 tonnes, roughly one-tenth of the 1996/97 cocoa crop.
World Bank officials put the figure at around 50,000 tonnes.
The March 7 decree said officials would ""systematically destroy all plantations in parks and reservations"" to stop clearance of classified forests and national parks. A ""decontamination"" period would allow individual cases to be considered and give farmers time to quit farms.
No timetable or details of implementation were given.
Crop analysts expect Ivorian forest protection plans to bite in 5-10 years as World Bank and international pressure grows, but they predict limited action over the next few years.
""(The evictions) could be bluff so we do not expect any short-term effect,"" said one, adding that ""illegal"" output was impossible to quantify. ""The (""illegal"") yield would change each year with tree age and as planters move around.""
Donors say protected forest cover has dropped to 3.6 million hectares from 13 million at the time of independence from France in 1960.
SODEFOR offices in forest areas have displayed copies of the decree near entrances next to local newspaper articles on evictions of farmers and destruction of cocoa trees.
Yao said some farms had been destroyed in increasingly productive forests bordering the large Tai National Park in south-west Ivory Coast near Liberia, but elsewhere the action had been limited.
""At Guiglo (western district) and around Tai, it has begun,"" said Yao. ""(SODEFOR) is also replanting along roadsides as a first step to cut down on access to deeper forest areas.""
Up-country buyers say a large SODEFOR base north of Ivory Coast's increasingly important cocoa export port at San Pedro has recently been expanded.
""People had one-hectare farms or so but then chopped more and more forest down. Now there are no more animals so we have to walk 20 km to hunt,"" said one village cooperative buyer for a main Ivorian exporter. ""The policy is a good idea.""
Exporters said one farmer had lodged a complaint with San Pedro's prefect in April after eviction from a nearby farm outside Meadji. Others in deep forest areas had also been hit.
Crop analysts say large swathes of protected forest have been cut down but farming techniques there were poor.
Tai forest officials say loosely-defined tenure laws could make the destruction of plantations and villages difficult.
""The farmers are in negotiations with SODEFOR. Some of them have been in the forest for 20 years so we don't know where they will be lodged,"" says Commandant Koffi N'Dri, head of the Tai forest protection unit PACPNT (Projet Autonome pour la Conservation du Parc National du Tai.
""Illegal production in Tai itself is very small but in the surrounding forests it is another matter,"" he added.
Tribal chiefs south of Tai said oil palm plantation owners had destroyed more forest than cocoa and coffee growers.
""In five or 10 years we will no longer have any forest in our region,"" one Tai forest chief told Reuters.
""There is some cocoa and coffee but it is closer to main roads,"" he said. ""(The state says it owns) the forest but we want to rent land so at least our children have a future.""
Palm oil firms had chopped down forest and recruited villagers to work plantations without any rent or tenure provisions.
Refugees from neighbouring Liberia's war had mainly planted food crops, rather than cocoa and coffee, chiefs and missionaries living in south-western forest areas told Reuters.
""Oil palm prices are better than for cocoa here,"" said one priest near the Liberian border.

18,"Ivory Coast's 1996/97 coffee is likely to be well up on last season but rising volumes are bringing quality problems, regional buyers and exporters' agents said.
They expect coffee marketing, sluggish for the time of year, to pick up in February.
""There's a lot of coffee about but quality is poor,"" said one buyer based in the Man region. ""We could see well over 230,000 tonnes but exporters have bought little so far and made large quality adjustments.""
Port forwarding agents said they had noted no major quality problems with coffee received for export. One quality inspector suggested that as little as 150,000 tonnes could be shipped out this season.
Ivory Coast opened its 1996/97 coffee season late on November 14 amid plummeting prices, and forecast output at 230,000 tonnes against 180,000 last year.
Farmgate prices were cut by 200 CFA to 500 CFA a kilo.
""Farmers have been waiting for a price rise hoping it will be a sellers' market,"" said one buyer. ""Little care has been taken over sorting as farmers have less time, but exporters want better quality than last year.""
Farmers face a higher than normal January cocoa harvest as well.
""This season will be twice a long as usual,"" said one buyer north of San Pedro, commenting on the slow start.
""We should be busy into April,"" said a buyer around Soubre.
Buyers expected to be at their busiest in February and March with port forwarders slating peak arrivals in April and May.
Large amounts of coffee could be seen along roadsides around buyers' stores this week with stocks said to be rising.
Buyers in most regions pointed to high percentages of black beans, fragments and bean husks.
""Humidity is around 16 percent,"" said one buyer in San Pedro, against a 13 percent export standard. ""Exporters are rejecting around 10 percent even after sorting,"" he added.
One buyer in Sassandra in the south said some farmers were delivering sacks with 50 percent of problem beans.
Quality is widely seen as better in more productive northern areas around Man, where weather had been more favourable.
""Farmers are only now getting the message about quality but we have been buying since November,"" said the manager of a new buying unit in Man opened by a processor.
The unit was advertising 30 CFA above guideline prices for top grades but paid 477 CFA for lower grades. Margins of up to two percent for quality variation applied within each grade.
About one thousand tonnes had been bought by the end of January. Around 420 tonnes had left for Abidjan, with the rest, including 299 tonnes of low grade stocks, in Man warehouses.
Other buyers in the Man area, which is expected to produce 30 percent (corrects from 80 percent) of Ivory Coast's coffee, said they could not match the prices paid by processors.
""They can buy directly and save on transport and lower middleman charges,"" said one. Farmers had got into the habit of not sorting coffee in the past two years, he added.
Banks have been reluctant to fund exporters' buying operations out of concern that the Caistab would not pay up price support to its clients.
Buyers said some large exporters had not bought any crop.
A French coffee scientist based in Man said coffee bush flowering was good in many areas but dry Harmattan conditions could kill new fruits if rain did not fall.

18,"French chocolate group CEMOI is building a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast which will open in October 1997, the company's managing director said on Wednesday.
""The factory can process 60,000 tonnes of beans a year,"" Managing Director Patrique Poivrier told Reuters by telephone from CEMOI's headquarters at Perpignan, in the south of France. He put the cost of the project at 160 million French francs.
Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop locally by the year 2000 to add export value and remove lower quality late season (May-Sept), or mid-crop, beans from international markets.
CEMOI's factory would open at its full capacity but could be upgraded to 120,000 tonnes after two years, producing cocoa liquor and cocoa cake and butter, Poivrier said. Work began at the construction site in northern Abidjan (Yopougon) on Friday, he added.
CEMOI, one of Europe's largest chocolate confectioners, uses 40,000 tonnes of raw cocoa beans a year and would sell products from the extra 20,000 tonnes capacity mainly to Europe and perhaps China.
""We are also looking at markets in China,"" he said.
Poivrier said the factory had been planned to secure a regular supply of good quality cocoa and by-pass Ivorian commodity exporters.
Ivory Coast already has three cocoa processing factories with capacity for processing up to 160,000 tonnes of beans a year.
Europe's Callebaut Barry group owns two factories. Ivorian exporter SIFCA owns a third, with some share participation from U.S.-based Arthur Daniels Midland. It plans to expand capacity by 21,000 tonnes by 1998.
Several other factory projects are nearing final planning stages.
U.S.-based Cargill will soon reach a decision on whether to go ahead with plans to build a 60,000 tonnes-capacity factory in partnership with Ivorian exporter SICC.

""The problem is that stocks have been emptied for political reasons. There has been a problem with donors about that,"" said Joseph Alain Charriere, the U.N. World Food Programme's representative in Chad.
""That does not mean there will not be extreme hardship this year. It is very bad but not catastrophic."" he told Reuters.
The government says storehouses are precariously empty but the government's opponents point to vote-buying.
""There are ways of making people's lives more comfortable around election time,"" said one opposition party leader and former National Assembly leader Jean Alingue. ""Don't forget that 80 percent of Chadians live in the country and are mostly poor.""
CHAD SAYS SHORTAGE CRITICIAL
Chadian officials say urgent action is required as women struggle to set aside private stocks at village level to tide over their families through Chad's regular droughts.
The Director of Food Security, Ali Adoum Djourou, told Reuters recently that shortages could last until October. He cited a Rural Development Ministry report for December putting Chad's 1996/97 cereal deficit at just under 200,000 tonnes.
The United States aid agency USAID closed its Chad bureau last year as part of wider cuts while European stock donations have recently dwindled out of a preference for boosting grass-root production instead, say U.N. officials.
Donors agree severe drought has hit the Sahel region but they dispute food reserves are needed, pointing to a European early warning study putting Sahel area shortages at 17,000 tonnes instead of the government's forecast of 50,000 tonnes.
While donors recognise the deteriorating food situation is serious they also point to non-cereal food alternatives left out of food need calculations.
""All the elements that can lead to famine are nevertheless there,"" said Charriere. ""Output is down, cereal prices are rising, and transportation is difficult. People will be forced to sell whatever they have -- goats and camels -- just to survive.""
PRICES ALREADY SURGING
Prices were already spinning out of control, even though some of that was caused by speculation.
""Normally we would expect millet prices of 7,000-8,000 CFA (francs) per 100 kilos. Now we are seeing 12,000 CFA and we expect the price to rise to 15,000 or 17,000 CFA in 1997,"" said Charriere.
Chad, one the world's poorest nations, puts its annual cereal consumption at over one million tonnes with output seen at 840,000 tonnes in 1996/97, against 900,000 last year and a record 1.12 million tonnes in 1994/95.
The population stands at 6.9 million from 6.4 million in 1995 and 6.2 million in 1993.
FAO says production of one staple cereal, berbere, used in calculations could prove to be higher that the 90,000 tonnes anticipated.
""About 13 percent of the 200,000 deficit is really urgent,"" Chad director Pierre Gence told Reuters. ""That would mean 25,000 tonnes.""
Donors say poor roads, armed banditry, and farmers switching to more lucrative cotton crops in the unaffected south have made prospects worse.
Chad stepped up border patrols against rebel groups and smugglers around Lake Chad but donors say it is easier for some farmers to sell produce abroad when roads are closed by rains.

18,"Ivory Coast's 1996/97 coffee season has begun amid slow buying and reports of variable quality, industry sources said.
""SIFCA (the largest Ivorian buyer) has started buying, so we are likely to see others follow,"" said one large exporter. ""You could say that marks the real start of the season.""
Buying had been limited in December although up-country agents had been active with larger than usual volumes.
Output is put at 230,000-250,000 tonnes for 1996/97, against 180,000 in 1995/96.
The season was officially opened on November 14, rather than early October, as the Caistab marketing agency struggled to set a recommended price closer to falling world market levels.
""It will be a very large crop,"" said one local analyst. ""The coffee is now mainly off the trees and being sat on by farmers at village level.""
Buyers reported variable quality and humidity up to 15 percent in some areas, against export limits of 13 percent. ""Quality is particularly good around (northwestern) Man but elsewhere you will find opinion dependent on who you talk to,"" said one.
One source put arrivals by January 10 at San Pedro port at 3,337 tonnes, but figures for Abidjan were less clear.
Bank sources said in December they were reluctant to put money into coffee because of fears borrowers would not receive transfer payments from Caistab and would default on loans.
""That remains the case,"" said one exporter. ""Banks are certainly reticent, so purchasing is still low."" Continuing low world market prices added to the uncertainty, others said.
Bush tracks had dried out and some farmers were profiting from January sun to dry produce that was still damp because of the failure of harmattan desert winds to arrive in some areas in late December.
""Some farmers are also being paid below offical, recommended (500 CFA) a kilo prices,"" said one buying source.
Prices ranging between 300 and 500 CFA per kilo were being offered, depending on area and quality, the source said. But others said they were offering up to 540 for top quality grades.
One industry analyst said 44 exporters were licensed, against 32 last year, so some would struggle to balance accounts amid more acute internal price competition.
Attention is also turning to a report on further coffee sector liberalisation expected to be with donor market reform sponsors by the end of January.
Private British consultant Landell Mills and Co will submit its report amid donor calls for an end to cross-subsidies to the coffee sector from cocoa profits from the beginning of 1997/98.
""The price support is running at around 100 CFA a kilo based on current world prices,"" said one source.
The focus is also turning to Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) talks on January 23 which will focus on pushing up world prices through voluntary export restraints.

18,"Zaire's embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko went into a mini-summit in Gabon with a handful of fellow French-speaking African presidents on Thursday to try to find a peaceful end to the war threatening his capital.
Witnesses said Mobutu, sporting his trademark leopard skin cap, embraced Gabonese president Omar Bongo, another veteran leader who came to power in 1967, two years after Mobutu.
The two walked up a red carpet into the presidential palace to meet the presidents of Chad, Congo, the Central African Republic and former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea. Cameroon, chairing the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), was represented by the foreign minister.
One Zairean opposition newspaper, the Potentiel, dubbed the meeting Mobutu's ""Goodbye summit"".
But Zaire's government, in the person of Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba, rejected suggestions that Mobutu's departure for Gabon was a veiled flight into exile and said the veteran leader would return to his capital after the meeting.
""There's no question of the president fleeing the country,"" he told Radio France International on Thursday.
He said the only thing that would prevent Mobutu from returning immediately would be another meeting. ""He is coming back after the summit, unless there is another meeting. There is no reason why the president should flee the country no reason.""
South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, who brought Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila together on board a South African ship in Congo's port of Pointe Noire on Sunday, said at the time he would organise a fresh meeting within 10 days.
Hundreds of civilians and fighters from both sides were reported dead after a battle for Kenge, a town 200 km (125 miles) east of Kinshasa. Church and humanitarian sources hoped to establish whether massacres had taken place.
Mobutu, 66 and struggling with cancer, has dominated Africa's third largest country for more than three decades.
He has seen his hold over three quarters of the mineral-rich nation broken by Kabila and his rebels, who took up arms in October demanding Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis.
A spokesman in the Gabonese president's office, Vincent Mavungu, said Thursday's mini-summit aimed to find a negotiated settlement after the weekend meeting between Mobutu and Kabila.
""It is therefore normal that consultations take place at all levels to try and find this solution, that is what explains the presence of a certain number of heads of state,"" he said.
One U.N. source said he doubted very much whether there would be another face-to-face meeting between Mobutu and Kabila. ""They (the Central African presidents) will try to get Mobutu to withdraw in a dignified way,"" the source added.
Gabon's Bongo indicated that Mobutu's poor health had prevented the veteran president from meeting other heads of state on Wednesday. ""You know his state of health,"" Bongo said.
The Mobutu-Kabila weekend talks ended inconclusively.
Residents of Kenge, in radio contact with Kinshasa, said the rebels were in control of the town on Wednesday after Mobutu's forces recaptured it briefly on Sunday night. They said at least 200 civilians, 106 government soldiers and 15 rebels were killed.
Kinshasa was reported calm on Thursday but residents of the city of five million people remain apprehensive -- a mood reflected in the capital's newspapers.
The independent Reference Plus quoted Mobutu's security adviser Honore Ngbanda as saying the city was a powderkeg and any fire lit there could be very difficult to put out.

18,"One of Ivory Coast's largest cocoa and coffee exporters, SIFCA, will appoint a liquidator for its loss making up-country buying subsidiary, SOGEPAG, but exporters and buyers say port arrivals will not be affected.
""Our cost calculations were wrong and farmers never really caught on to our new ideas,"" Pierre-Dominique Blind, spokesman for SIFCA, owners of the SOGEPAG buying subsidiary, told Reuters in an interview. ""We lost too much money and could not go on refinancing debts.""
""Purchase volumes were too small and farmers' debts became a vicious circle,"" said Blind, managing director of UCEPAG, a holding company set up by SIFCA to run SOGEPAG.
SOGEPAG's warehouses could be empty for the rest of the season after a liquidator is named this week, and SIFCA would probably take back assets it wanted, he added.
Liquidation is expected to take at least three months.
Minority 33 percent shareholder DAFCI, an Ivorian exporter, was not immediately available for comment.
UCEPAG figures show cocoa purchases of 46,000 tonnes of cocoa and 9,741 tonnes of coffee in 1995/96, but other exporters said the figure was underestimated. In 1994/95 the amounts were shown as 43,000 and 9,000 tonnes.
SOGEPAG was set up in 1991 and guaranteed farmers fixed farmgate prices when world prices dipped. It paid official reference prices while other buyers paid less, said Blind.
""Our operation was based on protection against prices going down, but prices went up after 1991,"" he said. ""The aim was to take 20 percent of the market in three years but our sales only rose by about seven percent a year.""
The total Ivorian cocoa crop in 1995/96 was about 1.2 million tonnes.
Up-country buyers said SOGEPAG had not understood buying strategy upcountry. It paid cash but sometimes three days late.
""Our strategy was wrong. Farmers preferred immediate cash in hand, even if less than our prices,"" said Blind. ""We gave prefinancing and logistical support to farmers on good terms and then they would sell to someone else.""
SOGEPAG built up the number of its sites to 17 from four at its inception.
Other exporters said SOGEPAG's closure would have no effect on the market. ""SIFCA and DAFCI will probably take control of the key assets and others will step in to buy whatever is sold,"" said one.
""We will buy some of their trucks,"" said one buyer. ""No cocoa will be left in the bush.""
SOGEPAG has 120 vehicles, mainly collection trucks and tractors it used to hire to farmers and GVCs -- farmers' cooperatives which aim to sell directly to exporters.
SIFCA's parent SIFCOM is a main distributor of Nissan vehicles.
Blind said SOGEPAG was owed 160 million CFA francs for vehicle hire at one point but only 60 million had been repaid. ""Farmers saw us as a cash cow,"" he said. ""Variable cost inflation after depreciation of the CFA also got out of hand.""
He said many modern trucks on the market were too sophisticated and expensive for farmers.
Some industry analysts said farmers had made money out of SOGEPAG but did not see why a decision had been taken to close operations at this point.
""It is a pity for the farmers.  The World Bank had just approved funding for us to give them more training,"" said Blind. ""Now they will be paid less than reference prices and many GVCs have poor little logistical expertise.""
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season on October 24, setting farmgate cocoa prices unchanged at 320 CFA per bagged kg but delaying an announcement on guideline buyers and exporters rates.

18,"Ivorian port cocoa stocks stand at up to 175,000 tonnes as arrivals trickle in at about 1,000 tonnes a week, but April and brisk May exports will reduce levels, port sources said on Friday.
""The main season (Oct-April) is over so arrivals will be down until early May,"" said a source. ""Some exporters have stock at the margins of (export) quality limits so they will be waiting to mix it with fresh mid-crop (May-Sept).""
Sources put stocks at Abidjan at 100,000 tonnes with 75,000 at the second port of San Pedro.
Exporters' agents said some exporters were short of cocoa for immediate shipment, but others said this represented a temporary commercial squeeze rather than a broader supply problem.
""Smaller exporters may have bought contracts beyond their capacity, the Caisse may have issued too many contacts or maybe a few exporters are holding large stocks,"" said one shipping manager. ""I have people crying out for cocoa,"" he added.
Another agent said, ""We must wait and see if the Caisse renews export licences if contracts are broken.""
Latest bean sizes were around 90-105 beans per 100 grams, against an export standard of 105 with up to eight percent humidity, industry buyers said.
""Bean sizes are tailing off now but smaller ones are still up-country,"" said one.
Exporters are gearing up for mid-crop arrivals after returning from Easter holidays, but crop analysts have not completed up-country pod tallies to give an indication of volumes, they said.
Early estimates range from 100,000 tonnes to well over 160,000, down on 200,000 in the 1995/96 season, crop analysts said.
""If good rains now carry on and cherelles survive through April and May, I see no reason to be pessimistic,"" said one. ""Estimates will be out later in April but most pod counters will be up-country in mid-April.""
Some main crop could be held back to mix with mid-crop to reach an overall export standard.
Tree crop and declared mid-crop could vary widely, he said.
Warehouse stocks totalled up to 400,000 tonnes in early 1997 as exporters held back cocoa bought through auction for December contracts from the Caistab marketing body.
Auction prices were out of line with world rates before a rally ahead of March contracts, they said at the time.

46,"China Tuesday announced a ban on poultry and poultry products from Missouri and Oklahoma, citing what it said was the outbreak of a deadly disease.
The ban, which took effect Monday, was aimed at preventing damage from the ""very destructive"" Newcastle disease, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture told Reuters.
Official news reports said the ban was slapped on poultry products from the two states because of five cases of the disease discovered between July and September.
The disease, known as viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, or VVND, is deadly.
However, Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department, said he had not heard of any recent cases of VVND in Oklahoma.
""It's a very, very dangerous disease -- the most feared of poultry diseases,"" he said. ""The symptoms are like influenza, and once one bird gets the disease, all the poultry will die.""
The poultry industries of Oklahoma and Missouri were far down on the list of top U.S. producers and exporters, Holloway said. ""My estimate is that Oklahoma and Missouri account for less than 5 percent of U.S. poultry exports to China.""
Arkansas is the country's biggest poultry producer and home of industry giant Tyson Foods Inc.
A source at Tyson's Hong Kong office said VVND was known to exist in China, but this could not be confirmed.
Beijing has also banned all U.S. poultry brought into the country either by mail or hand-carried by travelers, according to the Ministry of Agriculture official.
The last major outbreak of VVND in the United States occurred in California in the 1970s and led to the eradication of the state's entire poultry population, Holloway said.
The United States exports around $500 million of poultry and poultry products a year to China, its biggest market after Russia.
The Chinese quarantine official told Reuters that the action was unrelated to other trade disputes with the United States and there were no plans to delay implementation of the decision.
Beijing and Washington are at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector. China had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.
On Sunday, Beijing announced it was delaying for one month implementation of those curbs, which had been scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.
In October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza. China and the United States held talks on the issue and the ban did not go into effect.
"
46,"China's foreign debts reached $109.5 billion at the end of June but the governor of the central bank said the country was confident of paying its bills.
Governor of the People's Bank of China Dai Xianglong said the nation's foreign exchange reserves of about $96 billion -- among the biggest in the world -- were comfortable, but not excessive.
""We are very prudent in our borrowing,"" he said, adding that the level of debt measured against exports -- or the debt service ratio -- was well within international warning levels.
""On the whole the repayment situation is good,"" Dai told Reuters in an interview.
""It is hard to say exactly where the debt level will be next year, but every year an additional $10 billion is possible,"" he said.
He said $10 billion had been the average annual addition to the debt level over the past five years.
""For a country of China's size, (the level of foreign exchange reserves) is not a big sum,"" he said. ""We can only say it is comfortable.""
Most of Beijing's debt was long term, but China needed reserves sufficient to maintain repayments as well as to finance four months' worth of imports, he said.
Beijing also had new needs for foreign currency following the recent move to make the renminbi -- China's currency -- convertible on the current account.
He described China's repayment status as good, although he conceded there were repayment problems with enterprises under the direction of local governments.
""There are some local government-run enterprises that are overdue,"" he said.
But Dai also said foreign banks had a responsibility to ensure that credit went to deserving enterprises.
""Foreign creditors of Chinese enterprises must be selective in their lending,"" he said.
The central banker said he expected the renminbi to remain stable though he saw upward pressure on the Chinese currency, partly due to an expected trade surplus of more than $10 billion this year.
That would be down from the $16.7 billion surplus China recorded last year and much better than initial forecasts for 1996.
Economists say faster payments of export tax rebates have encouraged many companies to turn to the export market, thereby helping the trade picture.
The renminbi currently trades at about 8.3 to one dollar.

46,"China has tightened safety measures after a fatal rocket explosion early this year and has found the cause of another launch failure in August, Chinese space officials said on Wednesday.
Further testing was needed for the Long March 3 rocket and that could delay China's launch schedule, they said.
""Launch vehicles will now self-destruct if there is a failure,"" said Zhang Qingwei, vice president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.
""We will also ensure that people (living in the area of space centres) will be moved away when we conduct a launch,"" he told an international conference on space technology.
A Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after launch in February, killing six people and injuring 57, according to official reports.
Unofficial sources have put the casualty toll much higher.
China's commercial space drive suffered another setback in August when a communications satellite failed to reach proper orbit after launch aboard a Long March 3 rocket.
""We have determined the cause of the August 18 failure and have taken corrective measures,"" said Zhang, adding that the problem stemmed from a faulty hydrogen valve on the third stage of the booster rocket.
""We are still conducting ground testing,"" he said. ""There will be delays (in the Long March 3) programme this year but this will not affect other Long March vehicles.""
An official of the China Aerospace Corporation, which oversees commercial satellite launches, said a Long March 3 rocket could be launched by the end of the year or early next year.
Two other launches using the Long March 2D and Long March 3A rockets were also expected to be made by the end of the year.
In January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, killing six people and destroying the Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.
China once enjoyed a reputation of being a cheap and reliable provider of satellite launch services but the string of failures has shaken its hopes of playing a bigger role in the commercial space business.
"
46,"China has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on Friday that price rises this year could be well below target.
Some economists say inflation has been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.
""This is better than expected,"" said Chen Dezun, head of the price research institute of the State Planning Commission.
""We could see inflation of between three and four percent this year,"" he told Reuters. The benchmark retail price index rose a meagre 1.7 percent in March and 2.6 percent for the first quarter of the year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.
China forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year. That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
China's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.
The inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.
Chen said good weather had been a factor, ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.
What China officially refers to as ""appropriately tight"" monetary policies had also been a crucial factor, he said.
""The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results,"" he said.
China has kept controls on fixed asset investment, keeping government spending down, and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.
After adjusting for inflation, the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.
""The key has been control over fixed asset investment,"" said Zhong Jiyun, an economist at the state think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Some economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably, China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.
Many inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they cannot repay.
Managers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.
But Zhong is among the economists who believe that China is not yet able to declare the war on inflation over.
""I believe we still need to keep the controls on,"" he said.
"
46,"China vowed on Friday to get tough in its drive to keep banks out of the stock market and accused big financial institutions of fuelling a speculative bubble on the nation's bourses.
State media quoted China's top economic policy maker, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, as warning bankers that they could go to jail for diverting funds into the stock market.
""We will vigorously seek to uncover any use of funds that are not in company accounts or the use of bank credits for stock market speculation,"" Zhu told a national banking conference in Beijing on Thursday.
""Those in positions of responsibility will be sacked and in criminal cases we will pursue the offenders under criminal law,"" he said.
In a commentary alongside the reports of the meeting, the Financial News, a daily published by the central bank, blamed a big rise in share prices last year on institutional speculation.
""Most people believe that a speculative bubble emerged (in the nation's stock markets) at the end of last year,"" it said.
It blamed this on a diversion of funds from the banking system into the stock market, and added that it was clear this had involved institutional money.
Beijing moved to cool off the heated stock market speculation -- which had pushed one of the main indices up as much as 360 percent -- by warning investors that what goes up must come down, and reminding them that the state would not step in to bail them out.
China also has been trying to keep its state-run banks from fuelling stock market speculation, first by severing their ties to trust companies -- which can put funds in the stock market -- and by making it harder for them to finance stock speculation.
Securities industry officials said the aim was to insulate the banking system from any major setback for the stock market.
""This is aimed at protecting the banking system,"" said Wang Yun, general manager of the Shanxi Securities Trading Centre in Taiyuan, a regional trading centre for the main bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
""Central government authorities would also prefer to see these funds go to state enterprises,"" he told the China Securities Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based publication.
But brokers said that while ensuring the health of the banking system was a noble goal, authorities should not drive all institutional money away from the market.
""China now has more individual investors than it had in the past, but the main investors are institutions,"" said a Beijing-based broker. ""If they are driven away, there won't be much turnover left in the market.""
"
46,"China is expected to unveil a cautious budget this weekend, avoiding bold but risky moves in 1997, the crucial year of the recovery of Hong Kong and a major meeting of the Communist Party elite, economists said on Friday.
The 1997 budget would again show a hefty deficit although it could be smaller than the 61.442 billion yuan ($7.4 billion) estimate for 1996, they said.
""This should be a year for a steady-as-she-goes budget,"" said a foreign diplomat who follows economic issues.
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli is expected to announce the budget to the National People's Congress, or parliament, on Sunday or Monday.
The recovery of the British colony of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 and the scheduling of the Communist Party congress for later in the year will most likely ensure cautious fiscal policies, economists said.
Beijing wants to see the Hong Kong handover proceed smoothly and its leaders have little inclination to take risks ahead of the congress which will set policies and decide who gets the top jobs for the next five years. Beijing's leaders also have an added reason for caution as they can no longer rely on the steadying hand of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died this month.
""I am not looking for anything startling in the budget,"" said another foreign diplomat.
Even if the deficit is not reduced this year, it will still be manageable. Last year's deficit was only 0.99 percent of estimated 1996 gross domestic product.
Economists said they expected to see higher tax revenues this year as China's economy grows at a steady pace and tax collection improves.
China has already forecast economic growth of 10.5 percent for the year, up from 9.7 percent recorded in 1996. Premier Li Peng on Saturday is to set a yet more cautious goal of 8.0 percent growth.
State revenues expanded 18.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, and economists said more efficient tax collection and better management of state finances were key factors.
Inflation will also be relatively modest this year, limiting upward pressure on government spending. Retail price inflation is forecast at less than the 6.1 percent of 1996.
Despite lower interest rates, Beijing will need to meet increased payments of interest and principal on past debts, said economist Li Yang, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
""This will mean more bonds will be issued this year,"" he said.
Economists said, however, this was not a major concern as it was largely in line with China's efforts to issue more tradeable debt to create an active secondary market and strengthen its financial sector.
But a cautious budget will mean China cannot afford to make deep cuts in subsidies to ailing state industry in 1997.
Many overstaffed state companies badly need to shed workers from their payrolls but Beijing's leaders are fearful this could lead to social unrest.
Economists will also be watching the military budget closely, where further increases in spending are expected.
Deng's chosen successor, President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, needs the support of the army to retain his grip on power.
In his eulogy for Deng, Jiang referred to the army as the ""pillar of the state"".
China has said it wants to reduce the size of its three-million-strong army but it is likely to more than offset savings with stepped up spending on advanced weaponry, analysts said.
"
46,"China issued more tough warnings on curbing risk in the financial sector on Thursday, fresh on the heels of the failure of one of its big trust companies.
It also accused some officials of ignoring past warnings and covering up problems.
""There are all sorts of serious financial crimes now and if these problems are not earnestly addressed, this could greatly weaken the payment system and damage the good reputation of our socialist financial system,"" said the official Financial News in a front-page commentary.
""The biggest problem is that some officials look but fail to see the problems in their own regions or departments,"" it said. ""When they see the problems they fail to check on them and in some cases they cover up and encourage such actions.""
The newspaper, published by the central bank, said failure to tackle the problems would exacerbate the nation's deficit and lead to unwanted growth in the money supply.
The central bank announced this month the closure of the big China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC), an investment house under the Ministry of Agriculture, because of serious illegal and irregular practices.
CADTIC's management was taken over by the state-run China Construction Bank while its foreign business was handed over to the Bank of China.
China has been trying to separate trust firms from state banks, fearing that trust failures could drag down the banking system and lead to social unrest.
China has no bank deposit insurance system and would probably have to step in to support a bank that went into default, banking officials said.
Its willingness to prop up trust companies is somewhat less certain.
U.S. rating agency Moody's Investors Service issued a report this month saying that central authorities might not rush to support troubled trusts. Repayment of foreign lenders in the event of future closures was not guaranteed, it said.
The Financial News said a planned separation of banks from trust companies -- originally set for completion at the end of last year -- had to be finished in the first half of this year.
Banking industry officials have said that the huge problems of the China Agribusiness Development Trust, while known to regulators for some time, were a ""wake-up call"" that foreshadowed more problems throughout the financial system.
The latest round of warnings followed a national banking conference that focused on excess financial risk in the banking system.

46,"China on Thursday tried to play down friction with the United States over a rising trade gap and called on the U.S. to end curbs on technology exports to put trade back in balance.
""The two sides should avoid taking actions that do not help the expansion of trade,"" said a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
""These are two of the biggest markets in the world,"" he said. ""They should be complementary.""
The United States said on Wednesday its trade deficit with China climbed to nearly $29 billion in the first nine months of the year, from $25 billion in the same period last year.
The trade gap, already the second largest for the U.S. after its deficit with Japan, was seen reaching $40 billion by the end of the year, up from $34 billion in 1995.
American economists said the mounting deficit was likely to create new frictions between the two countries.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said the growth in the deficit with China had slowed, but he called on Beijing to live up to its international trade obligations.
A group of influential U.S. senators, in a letter to President Bill Clinton, questioned Beijing's trade practices and said China should not be allowed to join the World Trade Organisation on special terms because it would harm American economic interests.
Beijing has been seeking to join the global trade body on favourable terms given to developing nations, but Washington has insisted that China's economy was too big for this treatment.
The Chinese Trade Ministry spokesman said Washington's policy curbs on U.S. exports were part of the bilateral trade problem. ""There are policy rulings that are holding back U.S. exports,"" he said. ""Where there are limits on technology exports, this is a lost export opportunity for the United States.""
The U.S. appeared to be moving to address this matter.
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Washington was considering allowing technical cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear technology despite concerns about safeguards over re-exports.
Christopher, after meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing, said the U.S. was looking at taking steps that eventually could allow American companies to sell their technology to China.
A Chinese economist suggested some of the criticism over trade was unfairly directed at China as U.S. imports were mainly labour intensive products that were not manufactured in the United States.
""If the U.S. does not buy these products from China it will buy them elsewhere,"" said Wang Jian, an economist with the State Planning Commission. ""These are goods produced by developing countries.""
But the economist conceded that bilateral trade problems could spill over into broader trade issues.
""The U.S. already is the main obstacle to China's plan to join the World Trade Organisation,"" he said, adding that renewed Sino-U.S. trade friction could further complicate the issue.

46,"China published on Saturday a list of anti-dumping rules to protect local companies from unfair foreign competition.
Chinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies, many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas, protect their share of the domestic market.
They also said the move appeared to be aimed at giving a legal framework to protection from unfair competition and clarifying procedures for its use.
""Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices,"" economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council (cabinet) development research centre told Reuters.
""Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies,"" he said.
The rules, published in the official People's Daily, give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment.
Prices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty.
The rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation. Special cases are allowed to take 18 months.
The rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose ""discriminatory"" countervailing duties against Chinese goods.
Beijing's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Many domestic manufacturers were pressuring the government to take steps to offset these policies, newspapers have said.
Other economists said China was trying to codify the protection of its industries and bring its trade policies more in line with international practice.
They added that as China sought to join the World Trade Organisation it was being forced to make its polices more transparent.

46,"China has captured the big prize in its recognition battle with rival Taiwan after South Africa announced plans to switch formal ties to Beijing.
But the lengthy transition of more than one year signals that much bargaining remains on the shape of future relations between the three governments, diplomats in Beijing said on Thursday.
""We...welcome (South African) President Nelson Mandela's positive statement concerning normalisation of relations between China and South Africa,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing.
""If South Africa can recognise reality at an earlier date it is in its own interests to do so,"" he said.
""This is in keeping with the basic interests of the peoples of the two countries,"" Cui said.
Mandela told reporters in Johannesburg on Wednesday that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing by the end of 1997.
Cui declined to comment on Pretoria's decision to switch only by the end of next year.
""South Africa must recognise there is only one China, recognise that Taiwan is a part of China and sever so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan,"" Cui said.
""Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. The People's Republic of China government is the sole, legitimate government of all China,"" he said.
""This has been our longstanding stand. It is very clear... Our stand has not changed,"" the spokesman said.
South Africa is the biggest of just 30 states that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China rather than the communist People's Republic on the mainland.
Taiwan and China have been separated since a civil war ended in 1949. China sees Taiwan as a rebel province not entitled to foreign ties while Taiwan insists its 21 million people should have a voice in international affairs.
""The South Africans have been the big fish for China,"" said a Beijing-based diplomat. ""The others are just minnows.""
But in most diplomatic divorces, the break is swift, and diplomats said South Africa was still trying to work out its future relationship with both sides.
""They are trying to gain maximum concessions out of the two sides,"" said a diplomat.
South Africa is probably looking for a package deal that includes investment and trade guarantees under a formal legal framework with Taiwan.
It is also hoping to limit damage.
Mandela, announcing the break wtih Taiwan, pointedly thanked the island for its economic support during his nation's transition from minority, white rule to democracy.
The announcement well ahead of formal recognition would also help South Africa preserve its consulate in the British colony of Hong Kong - which returns to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.
South Africa had been hoping to maintain official relations with both sides, a goal that proved unrealistic.
Taiwan had also been looking to duplicate a framework with the Pacific states of Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea which have formal relations with Beijing but have signed a ""mutual recognition pact"" with Taipei, diplomats said.
""These smaller states may get away with a format such as this but South Africa apparently was not in the same category,"" said a diplomat.

37,"Britain's Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday it had become involved in a probe into alleged irregularities at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, the funds arm of Deutsche Bank's UK-based investment bank.
A spokeswoman for the SFO said the office was in contact with British investment watchdog IMRO, which would share any relevant material with the office. The SFO investigates and prosecutes major financial crimes in the City of London.
IMRO's own probe into MGAM has already led to the suspension of two fund managers and briefly saw trading halted in three MGAM funds, which have around 90,000 small investors.
""We have been in contact with IMRO. IMRO are investigating and will share anything of relevance with us,"" the SFO spokeswoman told Reuters.
Trading in the three funds resumed on Thursday after a 180 million pound ($280 million) bail-out by parent company Deutsche Bank.
Sources in both the British banking and fund management industries said the probe appeared to be focusing on links between suspended MGAM fund manager Peter Young and a UK-based broker, Fiba Nordic Securities.
Young was not immediately available for comment.
A spokesman for Fiba Nordic Securities in London said the firm welcomed any investigation and denied any improper relationship with MGAM.
Fiba Nordic Securities has been a broker and valuer for funds managed by MGAM.
British regulatory sources said the UK's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) had previously been examining the activities of Fiba over another matter.
This had subsequently led to the investigation by IMRO into MGAM which prompted Young's suspension.
Young, whose own assets were frozen as a result of a high court injunction late on Wednesday, was suspended from MGAM on Monday. MGAM announced on Wednesday evening that a second manager, Stewart Armer, had also been suspended.
Young had managed two of the three suspended funds.
MGAM said Armer was suspended on Wednesday evening ""following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules"".
A source close to the investigation said Armer's assets would not be frozen and he was not a central focus of the probe. Armer was not available for comment.
But in Frankfurt a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said neither Young nor Armer had committed an obvious breach of regulations. ""But both were hovering on the brink of a grey area,"" spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf told Reuters.
According to sources close to the investigation, the probe is trying to determine whether the fund's investments in unquoted stocks were valued above their real worth.
British brokers said they had had few redemptions in the three Morgan Grenfell funds after trading in them resumed but the full extent of any exodus would only become apparent after a few weeks.
""We are not seeing any panic selling. Redemption levels look modest at this stage,"" an MGAM spokesman told Reuters.
However, banking analysts in Frankfurt said Deutsche had to tighten up internal controls to prevent a repeat crisis at its UK fund management division.
""Something like this can never be allowed to happen again. If Deutsche really wants to be a global player in investment banking, then its control mechanisms must keep in step with its growth,"" said Vereinsbank analyst Natalia Grasegger.
The fall-out from the MGAM investigation also spread to Sweden, where Young had invested substantially in unlisted stocks. Stocks held in his portfolio fell amid concerns from Swedish officials about the impact of the probe on the country's alternative stock market. ($1=.6373 Pound)

37,"British venture capital firm 3i Group Plc on Thursday reported a rise in first half net asset value (NAV) per share and revenue profits but said it had been held back by continental Europe and a strong pound.
3i's NAV for the period rose to 454 pence per share, from 426 pence in the first half last year, while profit before tax rose to 62.9 million pounds ($106 million) from 54.3 million.
""Its a pretty healthy increase. Its held back a bit by continental Europe...the markets have not been that good and there has also been the appreciation of sterling,"" Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive said in an interview.
Macpherson said a better indication of the group's performance was its British portfolio which had performed ""extremely well"", reflected in an 18 percent growth in revenue.
There were still plenty of opportunities available, he said, with the sort of companies that 3i invested in doing very well.
There had also been an improvement in general business confidence in Britain, which had improved for the fourth consecutive quarter, according to 3i's latest ""Enterprise Barometer"" survey.
Of 327 million pounds invested by 3i during the period, 284 million was in Britain.
Macpherson said the prospect of a general election in Britain by May 1997, had resulted in a number of investment opportunities for 3i as some company founders or management teams decided to sell their corporate holdings while the tax regime remained clear.
While the European performance had an impact on the NAV figure, the investment opportunities for 3i on the continent remained good, Macpherson said. Current pricing levels for small and medium-sized European companies in which the group invests were ""very attractive"".
During the first half of the year, realisation of investments continued at an encouraging rate, with sales worth 122 million pounds in Britain and some 36 million pounds in continental Europe.
Macpherson said the group had ""significant plans to expand in Europe"" and this was reflected in its decision to open an office in the German city of Duesseldorf in January.
This regionalisation would also involve opening offices in three other German cities -- Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart -- and the group also plans to extend its presence into the south of France.
The group said it wanted to open its first office in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, early in 1997.
Macpherson said Asia was ""an exciting part of the world"" for investment capital and Singapore had been chosen as it was a good communication centre from which other parts of the region could be covered.
He said the office would look at opportunities in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia but not in China. ($1=.5956 Pound)
"
37,"The head of Britain's financial markets watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) said on Tuesday that former Barings treasury chief Ian Hopkins had broken precendent in refusing to be bound by SFA rules.
Last week the SFA banned Hopkins from being a director in the City for at least three years for his part in the 1995 collapse of the blue-blooded British merchant bank. Nick Leeson, the Singapore-based trader whose unauthorised trading led to losses of nearly $1.4 billion, is currently serving a jail sentence for his role in the affair.
Hopkins was also ordered to pay 10,000 pounds ($15,800) towards the SFA's costs after an independent tribunal found that he was no longer ""a fit and proper person"" to be a director of an SFA regulated firm.
""Its been difficult for us because it has been without precedent. We've never had to confront this before when someone signed a contract with us to be bound by our rules and then in effect ignored them,"" Nick Durlacher, the SFA's chairman, told Reuters.
Hopkins, one of nine Barings executives to have been disciplined by the SFA, has always protested that the attempted to ""blow the whistle"" on irregularities in the Singapore operation but that other managers ignored his warnings.
""I think the tribunal judged that if Mr Hopkins was a whistle blower he didn't have much of a pea in his whistle,"" Durlacher said, adding that Hopkins ""had lived with an unreconciled balance of 100 million pounds for three months"".
Durlacher said he was ""not vitriolic"" about Hopkins although he said it had not been easy. But if anyone adopted the same approach in the future, the SFA ""would adopt the same process of being as scrupulously fair as we can"".
He strongly denied that Hopkins had been dealt with more harshly than others because of his refusal to recognise the SFA's authority over him. Hopkins told British newspapers after the ruling that it had been vindictive.
Durlacher also denied that he had offered Hopkins a deal as it would not have been up to him to do so anyway. He said he had only had one telephone conversation with him and had been very careful about what he said.
""What I did say to Mr Hopkins was that I encouraged him to argue his case in front of us rather than to ignore us,"" he said, adding this could either have involved arguing his case at a tribunal or to considering settling with the SFA, as seven of the other Barings executives disciplined by the SFA had done.
Only one Barings case is now outstanding. Ron Baker, who was head of financial products at the firm, is appealing against an SFA tribunal's decision to reprimand him over his monitoring of one part of Barings' proprietory trading activities. ($ = 0.630 British Pounds)

37,"Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, part of the giant Deutsche Bank group, has frozen the personal assets of fund manager Peter Young as a probe into suspected irregularities in three of its funds continues.
""We have obtained an injunction against Peter Young in order to freeze his assets,"" a spokesman for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche's investment banking arm, told Reuters on Thursday.
The injunction was obtained jointly with the Royal Bank of Scotland, trustee for the two funds managed by 38-year-old Young, who has been suspended and was on Wednesday reported to be at his home in Amersham, west of London.
The DMG spokesman confirmed a newspaper report that the injunction also covered the assets of a company called Russ Oil &amp; Technology, but declined to give any further details.
On Monday trading in three European funds -- the 788 million stg ($1.24 billion) MG European Growth Trust, the 134 million stg MG Europa and 445 million stg Dublin-listed MG European Capital Growth -- was suspended pending investigation.  
This is being undertaken unofficially by British investments watchdog IMRO, along with the company, and centres on the valuations of holdings of unquoted and pre-listed (those to be quoted within a year) stocks within the funds.
While few details of the alleged irregularities have emerged, a complex web which includes Swedish crown-denominated warrants in a Canadian mining company and shares in obscure Norwegian firms is beginning to surface.
The Financial Times said on Thursday the investigation into the Morgan Grenfell funds followed a Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) examination in April of a London-based broker.
This led it to look at the funds managed by Young and it had then made contact with IMRO, which had kept a ""watching brief"" on the funds until last week, the FT added.
The funds are due to resume trading on Thursday after Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday it would meet liabilities related to any irregularities that might be identified. The bank also said the prices at which the funds trade should not be hit.
On Tuesday it emerged Deutsche Bank had injected between 150 and 200 million stg into the funds, buying some of the securities for its own account to protect investors' interests.  
Despite this, fund managers say many of the 90,000 investors are expected to bail out of the funds when the suspension on them is lifted because of a loss of confidence. The full scale of the flight from the funds will not be known until later.
Analysts have already said that despite Deutsche's attempts to move quickly to limit damage at the British fund management subsidiary, its credibility and earnings are likely to be hit.
The impact on the asset management business will only become clear once the extent of investors' reaction is known.
But while the problems are confined to only three funds run by Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, the embarrassing and potentially damaging incident comes at a time when Germany's biggest bank is attempting to stamp its authority on the highly competitive world of global investment banking.
Taking on the tough competition of Wall Street firms in a bid to become a premier global investment house has involved a high-profile, and reportedly costly, recruitment drive to ensure the bank has the top people. At one stage this led to a threat of court action for poaching by rival ING Barings.  
Some banking sources say Deutsche Bank's own reputation should not be tarnished by investigations into the funds, adding its swift action and the bank's top-rating by credit rating firms should ensure there is little long-term damage.
But other firms are unlikely to show the bank any mercy and will do their best to capitalise on its current predicament.  
Stewart Armer, manager of MG Europa Fund was meanwhile suspended from his duties on Wednesday evening following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules. He has been replaced by Julian Johnston, head of the European equities team which includes UK equities.
Trading in the three European funds was suspending on Monday pending an investigation into possible irregularities, which is being undertaken officially by British investments watchdog IMRO. Last night, MGAM won a High Court injunction freezing the personal assets of fund manager Peter Young.
While few details of the alleged irregularities have emerged, a complex web which includes Swedish crown-denominated warrants in a Canadian mining company and shares in minor, unlisted Norwegian firms is beginning to surface.
The Financial Times newspaper said on Thursday that the investigation into the Morgan Grenfell funds followed a Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) examination in April of a London-based broker.

37,"A proposed reform of Britain's state pensions system would revolutionise the financial services industry, market participants said on Thursday.
The ruling Conservative government on Wednesday unveiled proposals which aim to prevent huge burdens falling on future taxpayers by making workers take responsibility for providing for their old age.
Roger Taylor, deputy chairman of composite insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, described the plans as ""the biggest shift in financial services in the last 50 years"".
Taylor said it would encourage other governments to follow suit, adding that if the proposals were enacted they would start to generate additional business in three to four years time.
""For the industry as a whole it is good news,"" Tony Baker, deputy director general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), told Reuters.
Prime Minister John Major must call an election by May and the opposition Labour Party is well ahead in the opinion polls.
Labour wants to retain the basic state pension and develop a new range of second pensions for those not already in occupational pension schemes.
But the banking and life insurance industry is gearing up for change whatever the outcome of the election, arguing that demographic changes mean additional pension provisions are essential for economic and social stability beyond 2000.
Banking analyst John Leonard of U.S. investment bank Salomon Brothers agreed that the British government's decision to address the problem was an opportunity for the industry.
""Anything giving rise to privately managed assets must introduce interesting products for banks and the insurance sector,"" he said.
He said a large additional pool of privately managed money to fund the pensions was a particularly big opportunity for the ""large volume, efficiently managed providers with good distribution networks.""
But the shift from state to privately held pensions could also spawn a major marketing war between the firms most likely to win business.
This in itself would be costly, at least at the outset. The start of any such scheme would be particularly important as once individuals had chosen a provider with which to invest their pension contributions, it would be difficult for other companies to persuade them to move.
Baker said there would still be plenty of business for existing players in the market which were not able to sell the new scheme, labelled Basic Pension Plus.
He said there would have to be regulations governing matters such as maximum charges, transferability, reporting and investment returns, while not all insurance companies would necessarily be included on the approved list of providers.
While the desirability of involvement for companies would depend on the rules set out by the government, Baker said the scheme could lead to further consolidation in the industry, where only the big, efficient providers could meet the criteria.
He said the scheme could hit smaller players and other elements of the industry, particularly independent financial advisors (IFAs), who could lose out if individuals chose to top up basic contributions with their main pensions provider rather than other companies.
""The need for a middle man might be much less than at the present time,"" he said.
Baker added that the government had underlined that it wanted simplicity and lower costs to result from the changes, factors which he said would mean individuals ""buying"" their pensions rather than being sold them.
The importance of the move was underlined by Royal &amp; Sun Alliance's Taylor, who said self-provision would become the biggest single transaction an individual would make.
Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Britain's Halifax Building Society, said earlier this week that the group would target long-term savings products -- life assurance, pensions and investments -- because of their growth potential.
""With an ageing population and governments unable to look after people as they have historically been able to do in retirement, the requirement on the private individual to provide for the long-term future will be accentuated,"" Blackburn said.

37,"Morgan Stanley's surprise merger with Dean Witter Discover will create a more competitive force in the European investment banking market.
""Other banks will look at this and think they have got a stronger competitor than they had before,"" a banking analyst at one European firm told Reuters on Wednesday.
Earlier the two U.S. firms said they had agreed to form a financial giant called Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co, with a market capitalisation of $21 billion.
Both U.S. and European investment banks have been pushing for more business in continental Europe and Britain, but analysts pointed out the merger would give Morgan Stanley's European aspirations considerable backing.
Not only would it increase the amount of capital at the firm's disposal for building its European presence, Dean Witter's U.S. retail network could also provide an additional distribution network for Morgan Stanley products.
The firms stressed there would be little overlap as a result of the merger, although they did not specify if there would be any staff cuts. A Morgan Stanley spokesman in London said he could not comment on the implications for the firm in Europe.
A Dean Witter official said it was still early days. ""We've only just seen the news. It was kept extremely quiet,"" Graham Elliot, sales manager at Dean Witter International told Reuters.
Elliot said Dean Witter employs about 120 people in London, with around 35 working in institutional equities sales. This business was, he said, consistently profitable and had been expanding. ""We talk to over 300 institutions,"" he said.
The firm already has significant placing power and its European business is extremely focused, he added.
Dean Witter, founded in 1924, has a presence on London futures and options exchange LIFFE, but it was not immediately clear how its operations there would be merged.
In Eurobonds, there will be no immediately obvious gains to Morgan Stanley. It has led 16 international bond issues deals worth $2.5 billion this year, putting it in 14th place in the league table compiled by Capital DATA Bondware.
Dean Witter is not active in the Eurobond market, while in 1996 Morgan Stanley ranked fifth in the league table.
Banking sources said the merger would be largely complementary in London, adding that the firms would have to search fairly hard to find room for cutting staff.
""But they don't usually look to take people on in this sort of situation,"" one said.
Morgan Stanley, founded in 1935, employs around 2,000 people in its Canary Wharf headquarters in the docklands area in east London and has just over 2,500 employees in Europe as a whole. Dean Witter's London offices are in the Broadgate development to the north of London's financial heartland.
Some said there could be a fall-out of key personnel if there was a significant change in corporate culture or a management restructuring of the European operation.
But the idea of a merger is not new to Morgan Stanley, which in 1994 engaged in unsuccessful talks with British merchant bank S.G. Warburg. Warburgs was later bought by Swiss Bank Corp.
A joint statement by Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter detailed the new senior management structure but gave no indication of the position of Morgan Stanley's executive chairman in Europe Sir David Walker or other senior European personnel.
Morgan Stanley insiders in London said the first they had heard of the merger was an address by Richard Fisher, the firm's chairman, over the internal communications system.

37,"Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's dispute with suspended star fund manager Nicola Horlick highlights a ""merry-go-round"" hiring system started by investment banks, banking sources said on Wednesday.
""One of the industry's failings is that it doesn't bring people up through the system. When a firm needs someone, it steals people from a competitor. This creates a destructive merry-go-round which can't be in anyone's interests,"" one banker said.
Newspapers said DMG suspended Horlick on Tuesday because she allegedly tried to lure colleagues at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, where she was head of UK pension fund business, to join her in a move to Dutch bank ABN AMRO.
ABN AMRO itself denied reports that the 35-year-old Horlick was poised to lure a team with her and DMG has declined to comment on the details of Horlick's suspension, except to say it centred on a potential breach of contract.
While the term ""poaching"" is widely used to describe the movement of teams from one firm to another, loyal colleagues following a key player to a new employer is nothing new, the banking sources said.
Most moves involve a significant salary and bonus rise and often swiftly follow payment of bonuses by the firm which an individual is leaving.
Banking sources said U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs, reported to have paid record bonuses last year, had lost a handful of staff since the payments were made.
In suspending Horlick, DMG, the investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank, has brought back into the open a subject often seen as a normal part of the rough and tumble associated with investment banking -- but which might be relatively new to the more staid world of fund management, the sources said.
""We are surprised to be mentioned in the context of poaching which would, by its nature, imply you are planning to take a whole team, which we are not,"" ABN AMRO chief spokesman Jules Prast told Reuters.
But he said he preferred not to discuss whether ABN AMRO had talked to or planned to talk to Horlick, who newspaper reports said had earned more than 500,000 pounds ($835,000) a year.
""She (Horlick) had certainly led a number of people in the (MGAM) division to think that she had ABN AMRO lined up,"" one banking source told Reuters.
But if Horlick was about to take a team of up to 20 fund managers with her to ABN AMRO, which is expanding its fund management activities in London, she might have given DMG a dose of its own medicine.
The investment bank has gained a reputation in recent years for an aggressive hiring spree aimed at top performers at other firms, which led to widespread suggestions that DMG was offering guaranteed bonuses -- some for up to two years -- to ensure that it got the staff it wanted.
This came to a head last July when DMG reached agreement with another Dutch firm, ING Barings, the investment banking division of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, over a separate poaching dispute.
ING Baring's chief executive, Hessel Lindenbergh, said at the time there was ""growing resistance and irritation in the industry towards firms which deliberately poach whole teams"" and that ""poaching teams pushes up pay unduly"".
Last year, DMG's global bonds chief Edson Mitchell said the firm had hired around 500 people since he left his previous firm Merrill Lynch. Many of the new staff came from Merrill, while others moved from the then S.G. Warburg arm of SBC Warburg. ($1=.5976 Pound)

37,"London will defend its share of foreign exchange trading once a single European currency comes into being, according to Judith Mayhew, who became the new head of the Corporation of London on Thursday.
""We must maintain our market share at all costs,"" Mayhew, who was elected as chairman of the Corporation's policy and resources committee, told Reuters in an interview. The body is the local authority for London's traditional financial hub.
Mayhew, a 48-year-old New Zealander who has lived and worked in the City of London since 1976, said the Corporation faces three main challenges. She sees the first as the body's survival to make sure it continues to represent the views of the City.
Her second challenge is to ensure that ""when the euro is introduced the City of London is the primary market (for it)"" while the third is to ensure LIFFE, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, dominates the derivatives market for the European single currency.
While Mayhew did not give her view on whether she would rather see the pound in or out of a the single currency, she said it was important for Britain to remain at the negotiating table for as long as possible while deciding its own approach.
And whatever Britain's attitude, the Corporation will work closely with Europe on technical aspects of its introduction.
If the trading of the euro is split more evenly between Europe's main financial centres, the only places to benefit will be New York and Tokyo which will lap up London's business, she said. And one of the Corporation's main aims is to increase the number of global banking headquarters within the Square Mile.
Mayhew said that regardless of the colour of the next British government -- the ruling Conservative party must hold an election by May -- the Corporation will continue to lobby for the right taxation levels and employee costs.
It will also look closely at the outflow of its revenue to the rest of Britain.
""Perhaps the balance is not right,"" she said. The body keeps only a tenth of its 700 million pound ($1.18 billion) revenue.
She believes London's strength comes from its international business, not from its domestic business and this makes it the ideal site for Europe's financial capital. She would have liked the future European Central Bank to have been here rather than Frankfurt but noted London already has the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Mayhew said the Corporation would continue to support the local authorities in surrounding boroughs, both through charitable work and other projects in deprived areas.
""It is an irony that we have got perhaps the richest part of Europe surrounded by some of the poorest parts,"" she said.
As long as there remained a threat of bomb attacks on the City of London, Mayhew said the so-called ""ring of steel"" erected to deter attacks by IRA guerillas would continue.
She described competition for prime investment banking tenants with the Docklands area to the east of the City as a healthy rivalry and welcomed the extra office space provided by the vast modern redevelopment of the former docks site.
""The City would like to remain dominant in keeping the primary markets together,"" Mayhew said, adding such close proximity was important to the way people worked.
And she welcomed a recent resurgence in London's property market, ""It is very good that the cranes are overhead in the City again and there is more development. Modern cities need modern office space,"" she said.

37,"British property group MEPC on Thursday announced a 14 percent increase in pretax profits for the year but said a writedown on a Los Angeles shopping mall had reduced its net asset value (NAV).
MEPC's chief executive said he was pleased with the rise in pretax profits to 140 million pounds ($227.2 million) from 122.6 million pounds the previous year, but admitted disappointment at the fall in NAV to 450 pence per share from 457 pence.
MEPC shares were 11p lower at 441-1/2p by 1218 GMT as traders said the NAV was below market expectations.
""We feel very confident about the whole of the profit statement. The only slight disappointment is on the NAV side,"" Tuckey said in an interview. Earnings per share rose nine percent to 22.9 pence and the total dividend stayed at 20 pence.
Tuckey said the NAV drop reflected a marginal fall in values both in Britain and elsewhere but it was less than the relevant indices. ""We feel that the performance of our UK portfolio, which accounts for 70 percent of the group, is indeed where we would have expected it to be.""
He pointed out the valuation date for the portfolio was August 31 and there had been activity and evidence of an improved market since then. ""If we redid the valuation for December 1, we would probably get a different answer,"" he said.
The other factor which had brought the NAV down was the 31 million pound write-down on the valuation of MEPC's Northridge Mall. This had been equivalent to 7.5 pence per share.
""We are convinced this is a temporary write-down because the centre is still getting back on its feet after the earthquake some three years ago. We are quite confident we will get that value back in the next two to three years as the centre re-establishes itself,"" he said.
And he defended MEPC's decision to give a target NAV of 690 pence per share for 2001.
""We're sticking our necks out...The portfolio is very very different to what it was three years ago and what we're trying to do is give shareholders some feel of where we think the performance is going to be in five years time,"" Tuckey said.
Tuckey said the full impact of the change of strategy in MEPC's portfolio would take time but there would be progress towards the firm's targets each year.
He said there was a much firmer tone to the markets, particularly in Britain over the last few months. Apart from Northridge, the rest of the U.S. portfolio had performed ""extremely well"".
MEPC plans to keep the lion's share of its portfolio in Britain, with the remainder in the United States and Australia. It has wound down its European portfolio and has no plans to go back into continental Europe in the immediate future.
Tuckey said the group was keen to make acquisitions, with the proceeds of its European disposals, but that there was a shortage of good stock available, particularly in Britain.
While MEPC has resolved to increase the dividend paid to shareholders, Tuckey said he could not predict when it would be increased although he pointed out that dividend cover had improved to 1.15 times from 1.05 a year before.
""It depends on the forward look, on how the markets are feeling,"" he said. The market was competitive and good stock was hard to find but Tuckey said he welcomed the prospect of changes to the way the market functioned with more liquidity likely.

37,"A high profile dispute between investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and ousted star fund manager Nicola Horlick has highlighted how crucial the lucrative asset management business has become to banks eyeing a share of the growing market.
""The attraction of asset management is the quality of earnings is far better than virtually any of the other areas of business the banks are involved in,"" a banking analyst at one major European investment bank said.
Relatively low risk and a growing market are other key factors driving banks' sometimes aggressive interest in building up funds under management, according to John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in London.
""The overall driver seems to be that it's a good growth business for relatively low risk,"" Leonard told Reuters.
He pointed out that once customer relationships were established, particularly on the retail side, they lasted -- although the institutional market could be more volatile.
Widespread media coverage of 35-year-old Horlick's dramatic resignation last week as head of British pension fund business at MGAM has brought home to the general public -- many of whom have pensions or savings with such firms -- just how much top performing individuals and their employers earn.
Horlick was suspended from the asset management arm of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, part of the mighty Deutsche Bank group, amid accusations she had tried to lure a group of colleagues to leave with her for rival firm ABN AMRO.
Horlick, who was reported to have earned one million pounds ($1.66 million) a year and was at the top of the industry in London, continues to deny allegations that she was leading a breakaway group.
Dutch bank ABN AMRO has also denied it tried to poach Horlick's team or was planning to back a management buy-out of its British pension fund business but on Tuesday told Reuters it would consider buying a large British fund manager and was keen to make ""big steps"" in London fund management.
The Horlick saga has demonstrated that banks are willing to match and substantially improve on the pay of such stars if it means they can gain ground in the battle for relationships with major pension funds and the fees they bring with them.
This high-quality fee and commission income promises to grow as the pool of funds in need of management is swelled by demographic changes and an increasing reliance on individuals making their own provision for old age rather than relying on diminishing state resources, analysts said.
Asset management, usually looking after other people's money rather than a firm's own, is not a capital-intensive business and margins remain attractive for those controlling the billions of pounds of pension fund and investment assets now swirling around the mature markets of Britain, the United States and Japan.
The British pension fund market alone is worth around 600 billion pounds, one analyst said, adding that the longer-term opportunities in Europe were good but that both Germany and France would have to persuade people to make their own provisions for their retirement before the market took off.
Compared to an increasingly competitive lending market, where margins are wafer thin and banks have to provide shareholder value while meeting stringent capital requirements on their loans, such business is another indication of banks being cut adrift from their traditional business.
""They are trying to replace revenues they are losing elsewhere. Asset management is seen as a growth business,"" Martin Cross, banking analyst at UBS said. ($1=.6021 Pound)

41,"Monsanto Co, which produces genetically altered soybeans, on Wednesday defended the scientific tests that back its safety claims for the crop.
""We did something like 1,800 tests to evaluate those soybeans,"" said Karen Marshall, manager of public affairs for Monsanto. ""These soybeans are absolutely safe.""
The environmental group Greenpeace has continued to protest the genetically altered soybeans and has criticized  Monsanto for allegedly not testing the biotech crop for exposure to the herbicide Roundup.  
Monsanto's genetically altered Roundup Ready soybeans are resistant to the Roundup herbicide, allowing farmers to spray Roundup on the fields to kill weeds without harming the crop.
But use of Roundup to kill weeds could result in residue on the harvested soybeans.
Marshall of Monsanto, however, said Roundup residue is not an issue since tolerance levels for the herbicide had been previously established and did not need to be established by testing.
Therefore, Monsanto's testing of biotech crop focused on genetic alteration.  
""What we figured would be the new piece of information was the one protein that we added to the plant, itself,"" she said.
Marshall said Roundup Ready soybeans have been reviewed and approved by regulatory bodies in Argentina, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the European Union and United States.
She added that Roundup Ready soybeans have also received food safety approvals in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and most recently Denmark, and are under consideration in Switzerland.
Merrill Lynch analyst Douglas Groh said that while concerns about the Roundup Ready soybeans must be addressed, he does not expect any impediments to market the crops.
""In some form or fashion, Monsanto will be able to commercialize the work that they've done,"" said Groh, who focuses on agribusiness and biotech companies.
He added that residue on the soybean crop should not be an issue since Roundup breaks down over time to ""environmentally benign"" substances that do not pose a threat.

41,"Archer Daniels Midland Co's $100 million agreement with the U.S. Justice Department will likely have minimal financial impact on the agribusiness giant, which has about $1.3 billion on hand.
""This is not going to affect their balance sheet in any meaningful way,"" said NatWest Securities analyst David Nelson.
But the settlement leaves unclear for the moment the fate of two top ADM executives, who had been expected to face indictments in a nearly four-year antitrust investigation into lysine, citric acid and high fructose corn syrup.  
ADM had said in a proxy statement in advance of its October 17 annual meeeting that indictments in the lysine probe were being considered against the company, Michael Andreas, vice chairman, and Terrance Wilson, a group vice president in charge of corn refining.
A government source, however, said the investigation is ""ongoing.""
ADM did not return a phone call requesting comment on the status of possible indictments against the executives. The Justice Department declined comment.  
""That's intriguing, that there is no mention (of) the individuals,"" said antitrust attorney Joe Sims, a partner in the Washington office of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue. Sims is not involved in the ADM antitrust case.
While the $100 million in fines is a record for Justice in an antitrust case, analysts said ADM has an estimated $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and marketable securities. The company has another $1.1 billion in long-term marketable securities.
ADM agreed to pay $70 million to settle antitrust charges for lysine and $30 million for citric acid.  
Beyond those two products, the settlement also puts an end to Justice's antitrust probe of high fructose corn syrup, a widely used sweetener. ADM did not pay any fines for this product, which posed the largest potential liability given the size of that market.
Previously, ADM settled civil cases brought by its customers and agreed to pay $25 million for lysine, a feed additive, and $35 million for citric acid, which is used in food and beverages.
A civil case brought by a class of high fructose corn syrup customers is pending.  
""The important news here is just that the criminal investigation is behind them,"" Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg said.
The fate of Michael Andreas, son of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, is not expected to impact succession at the Decatur, Ill.-based company.
Piper Jaffray analyst George Dahlman said analysts have ruled Michael Andreas out for the chairman's post since he has been expected to face price-fixing charges.
In an interview in January, however, Dwayne Andreas said he believed there were eight people who could possibly succeed him some day, including his son. He said at the time there was no current succession plan at ADM.
The stock market reacted positively to the settlement, sending ADM's stock up 3/4 to a new 52-week high of 21-3/8. ADM's stock has also been bolstered in recent weeks by lower corn prices that have improved its grain-processing margins.

41,"American Trans Air (ATA), which recently announced plans to cut back its jet capacity and some scheduled service, expects to forge additional alliances with other air carriers.
""We clearly think that code-sharing is an opportunity for this company to expand the markets in which it can participate,"" Kenneth Wolff, chief financial officer of Amtran Inc, parent of ATA, said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
In late May, ATA and Chicago Express Airlines agreed to a code-sharing agreement.  
Under these agreements, the airlines put their codes on each other's flights in computerized reservation systems.
""In general, it has exceeded our expectations, although this was a relationship which we both went into expecting some good things,"" Stanley Pace, president of the Indianapolis-based company, said of the alliance with Chicago Express. ""The benefits have been much more substantial than we both thought they would be.""
Looking ahead, ATA will continue to serve vacation destinations from Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Chicago's Midway Airport with charter and scheduled service.  
But Pace added that expansion of its service will be made more ""thoughtfully"" than in the past when the carrier underwent rapid growth.
In the second quarter, Amtran lost $0.20 a share, compared with a year-ago profit of $0.29, due to aggressive scheduled service expansion that was not as profitable as it had hoped.
ATA said last week it is cutting back some of its scheduled service, particularly from Boston to destinations like Orlando, Fla., and Nassau, Bahamas.
ATA also has said it is reducing lease obligations for Boeing Co 757 jets to boost its operating efficiency.  
These steps are expected to improve Amtran's profitability, although Pace said the next two quarters will be a transition period for the company.
Pace declined to comment on near-term earnings projections. According to First Call, the mean analyst estimate for the third quarter is $0.28, based on a wide range from breakeven to $0.55 a share. A year ago it earned $0.31.
""We're going to strengthen the bottom line fairly quickly over the next two quarters so that we have a solid foundation...to resume deliberate, systematic, thoughtful and profitable growth through 1997 and into 1998,"" Pace said.
Company executives acknowledged that some consumers postponed buying tickets on ATA following the May 11 ValuJet Inc crash in the Florida Everglades.
To allay consumer concerns, Pace said ATA emphasized its safety record of flying 23 years without any serious accidents.

41,"Tate &amp; Lyle Plc said Tuesday its U.S. subsidiary A.E. Staley continues to face reduced profit margins for high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener.
Fructose contract prices for 1997, which largely have been set, are lower than a year ago, as are corn costs, said Larry Pillard, chief executive of London-based Tate &amp; Lyle.
""On a margin basis (factoring out corn cost changes) they are maybe slightly lower,"" Pillard told Reuters at an analysts' conference here.  
Pillard blamed lower margins on overcapacity in the U.S. fructose industry. Staley's output accounts for a little over 20 percent of total U.S. fructose production.
To balance the softness in fructose margins, Staley has shifted some output to other corn-based products, including ethanol, starch used by the paper industry, and specialty food starches.  
""In addition to that, we've continued our very aggressive cost-reduction initiatives at Staley,"" Pillard said. ""Yes, we'd like higher margins in fructose. But we're not completely dissatisfied with Staley. We're still very bullish on the corn refining business.""
He added that U.S. fructose demand continues to grow by four to five percent a year.
Pillard acknowledged that ""in a worst case scenario"" it may be another two or three years before demand in the U.S. catches up with fructose supplies.  
But one promising variable is the potential for greater demand for fructose in Mexico.
Beyond fructose, Tate &amp; Lyle is investing in number of value-added products, including a lactic acid plant it likely will build in the United States and a citric acid joint venture in India.
Tate &amp; Lyle, as a producer of sweeteners and starches, is already expanding its global presence, with investments in developing markets.
Those investments, which have totaled $250 million over the past few years and spread over four continents -- is projected to generate a return on invesment of over 20 percent after five years, according to Simon Gifford, group finance director for Tate &amp; Lyle.
Investments have been made in Mexico, central and eastern Europe, Asia and Africa.
Tate &amp; Lyle also is building a world-scale starch plant in northern France, which will use wheat as a raw material.
""That will be completed by the end of this calendar year,"" Gifford said. ""We will start getting returns after commissioning in the second half of next year.""

41,"McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday it created a new position of chairman of its U.S. operations, in a move analysts said was sparked by intense competition and soft sales from existing stores in the domestic market.
McDonald's named Jack Greenberg, 54, to the new post of chairman, McDonald's U.S.A. He remains vice chairman of the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company, but will relinquish the chief financial officer post.
Greenberg will continue to report to Michael Quinlan, McDonald's chairman.
""The signal they are trying to send is, 'we clearly recognise that we have problems in the U.S. and we are going to do something about it',"" NatWest Securities analyst Damon Brundage said of Greenberg's appointment.
Reflecting the mature and intensely competitive U.S. market, analysts said they expected McDonald's third-quarter same store sales will be down compared with a year ago. Same store data measure sales from units open at least a year.
""They have not had a single positive month in the U.S. this year,"" Brundage said of its same store sales. McDonald's does not disclose its same store sales.
""Margins have been under pressure for over a year in the U.S.,"" added Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels.
Greenberg's new post indicates that McDonald's was not pleased with the direction of its domestic business, Daniels said. ""They are trying to shake things up and put a little more focus on being aggressive in responding to the competition,"" he added.
The company has been introducing new offerings such as its Arch Deluxe hamburger earlier this year and the recent launch of Deluxe Grilled Chicken, Fish Filet and Crispy Chicken sandwiches.
McDonald's said Greenberg's appointment was aimed at strengthening U.S. management.
""While these changes are evolutionary, they will bring more management firepower where we need it, both for the short and long-term,"" Quinlan said in a statement.
As part of the management changes, Edward Rensi, McDonald's U.S.A president, will report to Greenberg. But Greenberg was quick to say he and Rensi have a good working relationship.
""Ed and I are good friends. We work well together. He's very enthusiastic about this,"" Greenberg said in a telephone interview. ""We all want this business to do well.""
Despite the pressure in the United States, McDonald's international business, which accounts for more than half of its operating income, continues to be strong, analysts said.
""International is a wide-open growth opportunity for McDonald's,"" Daniels said.
International profit growth is expected to contribute to an expected 12 percent gain in earnings for McDonald's overall in the third quarter, according to analyst estimates.
Given the intense competition between McDonald's, Wendy's International Inc. and Grand Metropolitan Plc.'s Burger King, Greenberg faces a tough job as head of the U.S. operations, analysts said.
""He is going to parachute into ... what looks to be one of the most challenging operating roles in the U.S. fast-food restaurant business,"" Brundage said.
Greenberg, 54, said he believed McDonald's was well positioned to compete in the domestic market.
""We've got more locations than anybody else. We've got the most powerful brand in the world... We've got the largest marketing budget. We've got enormous purchasing power,"" he added.
McDonald's operates more than 19,200 restaurants worldwide, including about 12,000 in the United States.
While Greenberg joined McDonald's in 1982 as chief financial officer, he said he has field experience with its restaurants. ""I spent a year in the field in restaurants and became a regional manager for a year as well,"" Greenberg said.
In other management moves, McDonald's also named Michael Conley, currently senior vice president and controller, as chief financial officer, succeeding Greenberg.

41,"Archer Daniels Midland Co, which pleaded guilty to price fixing this week, will face tough criticism at its annual meeting Thursday from shareholders seeking to make ADM's board more independent.
""There needs to be dramatic reform at this company, at...both the board and the management level,"" said Edward Durkin, director of special programs at the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.
The carpenters union is among four institutional shareholders pressing for changes in ADM's board.  
Despite the settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, including the payment of $100 million in fines, corporate governance issues remain at ADM, according to Jon Lukomnik, New York City deputy controller for pensions.
""I think people are looking at this (the Justice settlement) as if it's the last scene in a five-act play. It is not,"" Lukomnik said.
Going forward, Lukomnik said he is looking for ADM to, over time, enact steps to make its board more independent and to set a succession plan for the eventual retirement of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, aged 78.  
The chairman's son, Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, is among two executives still being investigated by the Justice Department as the price-fixing probe continues. Also being investigated is ADM Group Vice President Terrance Wilson.
""Dwayne Andreas is not young. A person they were grooming to be a successor is the target of an investigation,"" Lukomnik said, referring to Michael Andreas, who had been seen in the past as a possible successor to the chairman's post.
A shareholder proposal calling for a more independent board at ADM is garnering a significant number of votes.  
The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said earlier a survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favor of that measure.
CalPERS co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.
""Our primary focus is the proposal,"" Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS, said. ""But i think we also need to see some increased oversight (of management by the board).""
Other proposals include a measure by the carpenters to hold directors personally liable for gross negligence. The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund proposed confidential voting for directors when there is no competing proxy.
At last year's annual meeting, Chairman Dwayne Andreas kept a lid on shareholder comments. When Durkin of the carpenters union tried to gain the floor, he was told by the chairman, ""This meeting runs according to my rules.""
Durkin, who will attend this year's annual meeting, said he was hopeful shareholders would be able to voice their concerns this year.
He added the company had sent him a fax outlining the agenda, when issues will be raised and how much time will be allotted for comments. ""There needs to be some basic rights allowed to the (share) owners,"" Durkin said.

41,"Competitive pressures in the U.S. cereal market are expected to put a crunch on earnings for two companies -- one the branded leader and the other the largest maker of private-label cereals.
Analysts said Kellogg Co, the largest U.S. cereal maker, is expected to report flat fourth quarter earnings, although it may be able to eke out a rise of a penny or two.
Ralcorp Holdings Inc, which makes private-label -- or store brand -- cereal, is expected to report lower earnings for its fiscal first quarter, analysts added.
In both cases, earnings are pressured by price cuts and promotions in the intensely competitive U.S. cereal market.
Kellogg has seen its market share decline recently in the face of heavy promotions by its rival, General Mills Inc . General Mills last month reported an increase in its fiscal second quarter earnings to $1.00 a share from $0.92.
""(Kellogg's) domestic earnings are clearly going to be down on lower sales and some increase in marketing spending,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez.
She added Kellogg's market share appeared to have risen somewhat in December as it increased promotions.
Among the other food companies reporting quarterly earnings, poor pork and beef margins are expected to hurt fourth quarter earnings for meat processor IBP Inc.
""IBP will have down earnings, how far down we don't know,"" Piper Jaffray analyst George Dahlman said.
Quaker Oats Co is expected to report an operating profit for the fourth quarter compared with a year ago operating loss. Quaker, however, is expected to take a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of its Snapple beverage business.
""The issue for Quaker is how big of a charge they take for Snapple,"" said BT Securities analyst John O'Neil.
Quaker said in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it was reviewing Snapple for a possible charge to reduce the carrying value. A Quaker spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of a charge in the fourth quarter.
Sara Lee Corp is expected to report a double-digit earnings increase for its fiscal second quarter, with the biggest improvement in its meat and bakery division, said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach.

41,"Monsanto Co's board of directors, at its regularly scheduled meeting on Friday, is expected to decide the fate of the chemical business that the company has said it wants to shed, analysts said.
A Monsanto spokeswoman on Thursday confirmed the Monsanto board is meeting on Friday, but she declined to comment on what it might do.
""I can confirm that the board is meeting tomorrow,"" she said. ""I cannot ever presume board discussions, actions or vote, and we won't comment on that sort of speculation.""  
In October, Monsanto said it was considering several options, including possibly spinning off its non-agricultural chemical business.
The remainder of Monsanto would be a life sciences company with core businesses of agricultural chemicals such as its flagship Roundup herbicide, biotech operations and the G.D. Searle pharmaceutical unit.
Another possible option for Monsanto would be to sell or merge the chemical business with other firms.  
""Probably a spinoff is likely,"" said PaineWebber analyst Paul Raman. ""There is a significant tax liability of selling it (the chemical business). The capital gains tax on it could be about $500 million plus or minus.""
Among the possible suitors mentioned for Monsanto's chemical business was Hercules Inc, analysts said. They added that Monsanto could be interested in the Tastemaker food and beverage flavors business held by Hercules and its joint venture partner, Mallinckrodt Inc.  
Hercules and Mallinckrodt have previously said they were seeking a buyer for Tastemaker. But a Mallinckrodt spokeswoman said no offers had been received for Tastemaker and no agreements had been signed.
The Monsanto spokeswoman declined to comment. Hercules was not available for comment.
Should Monsanto opt to swap its chemical business for assets of another company it would reduce its tax liability, analysts said.  
Whatever action Monsanto takes, analysts said they expect the board of directors to decide the course of action at the meeting on Friday.
""This is the last board meeting of the year. It is a planned meeting,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Groh said.
Speculation that Monsanto was near a long-anticipated final decision on its chemical businesses helped boost the stock, which ended the day up 2-1/4 at 41-3/4.
Analysts have previously said that shedding the chemical operation, which are profitable, would enable Monsanto's life sciences business to trade at a higher multiple.

41,"CPC International Inc. said Wednesday it will spin off its corn refining operations to shareholders so it can concentrate on producing consumer foods like Hellmann's mayonnaise, Mazola corn oil and Skippy peanut butter.
""The fit of those businesses (corn refining and packaged foods) is not as good as it was,"" CPC Chairman C.R. Shoemate said in a telephone interview. ""Going forward they will be able to grow ... faster by focusing on the key drivers of each of those businesses.""
The stock market applauded the move, sending CPC's shares up $2 to $84 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
""I think it's a good strategic move,"" Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach said.
CPC's corn refining operations yield high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; corn starch; dextrose, a food ingredient and sweetener, and traditional corn syrup.
Although corn refining was profitable in 1996, that business was a drag on CPC's overall earnings due to dramatic swings in the corn market, the company said.
CPC reported net income of $580 million last year, up from $539 million a year ago.
After shedding the corn business, CPC will concentrate on its global packaged food, bakery and food service businesses, which analysts called among the best in the industry.
""I think that the company will finally come into its own in terms of recognition of the quality and growth potential that it has,"" Schroder Wertheim analyst Robert Cummins said.
After the spin-off, CPC will be a global branded packaged food company with grocery products, baking and food service operations. Sales from these businesses amounted to $8.5 billion in 1996.
CPC's branded grocery and foodservice businesses operate in 62 countries worldwide. CPC has a large and profitable packaged food business in North America, although 60 percent of its total packaged food business is in Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa.
The spun-off company will be the third-largest corn refiner worldwide with sales of $1.5 billion, excluding non-consolidated joint ventures.
About two-thirds of the corn refining operations are in the United States and roughly one-third in Latin America, where it has about a 60 percent market share.
In North America, CPC's corn refining business is the leading producer of dextrose and corn starch, Shoemate said.
Corn refining joint ventures and technology agreements in Asia and Africa are small in terms of overall profits currently. ""But they are great starter positions for the longer term,"" Shoemate said.
Shoemate said the spin-off is expected to be completed in about 10 months, pending approvals, including a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it will be tax-free to CPC and its shareholders.
CPC, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said it did not expect to assign any of its existing debt to the new company.
However, it may launch an initial public offering of stock in the new company before distributing the new shares to existing shareholders, it said.
Konrad Schlatter, currently senior vice president and chief financial officer of CPC International, will be chairman and chief executive of the new corn refining company.
Samuel Scott will be president and chief operating officer of the new company and will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business.

41,"McDonald's Corp said its new restaurant openings for 1996 and 1997 likely will be at the low-end of its targeted range of 2,500 to 3,200 units.
""We will hit the low end of our projected range (with) 2,500-plus restaurants (in 1996),"" McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling told Reuters. ""We're just doing our planning for next year, but we expect to do 2,500 plus next year.""
This would be the first time in at least three years that McDonald's failed to beat its expansion projections, as it cuts back on limited menu -- or satellite -- units.  
In 1995, McDonald's opened 2,430 units, beating the projection for that year of 2,300. In 1994, it opened 1,800 units, beating the projection of about 1,400 to 1,700.
McDonald's has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide.
""We've been ratcheting up the level of development every year since around 1991,"" Ebeling said.
Ebeling said McDonald's this year plans to open about ""600-plus"" satellite units worldwide, down from its original plan of 700 to 1,000 satellites. The biggest decline will be seen in the United States.  
""We recognize we need higher volume restaurants to meet the kind of profitability that we'd like for ourselves and our franchisees,"" Ebeling said.
Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes said the profitability of some satellite units, which are often built in non-traditional sites such as shopping malls, has been uncertain. ""In the big picture, the financial performance of satellites appears to be spotty,"" Oakes said.
Ebeling said U.S. satellite units will account for about one-third of the total for these smaller sites, down from 60 percent as originally planned.  
Overall, Ebeling said about one-third of McDonald's restaurant openings will still be in the United States.
Bear, Stearns analyst Joseph Buckley added he would not be surprised to see McDonald's shift its restaurant opening strategy to further emphasize the international market.
McDonald's said operating income outside the United States contributed 59 percent to consolidated income for the quarter.
Earlier, McDonald's reported third quarter income of $0.62 a share, $0.01 below the consensus estimate, but above the $0.56 it earned last year.
McDonald's said its U.S. operating income was down five percent in the quarter, which it blamed partly on an intensely competitive operating environment.
Same-store sales in the United States, measuring results for units open for at least one year, were negative in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year.
But U.S sales may be picking up, Oakes added.
""I think (U.S. same-store sales) are starting to hit bottom,"" Oakes said. ""Thus far in October, it (seems) like they have picked up and are in the flattish range.""

40,"Regional Baby Bell phone companies appear to have triumphed over their long-distance rivals in a crucial regulatory battle that would leave some customers paying more and others less for their monthly bill.
The Federal Communications Commission has decided against ordering a precipitous cut in the $23 billion long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp pay the Bells each year for access to their local phone networks, said FCC and industry officials.  
Bell executives at one point feared such cuts could cost their companies as much as $10 billion in revenues. Consumer groups and long-distance companies more recently advocate immediate cuts in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, saying that would mean a similar cut in long-distance rates.
""The Bells have dodged a bullet,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group. ""They may get grazed. But they dodged a bullet that was aimed at them during the last six months."" The rules are set to be voted on next week.
Less clear is the impact on phone customers.
Those who make lots of long-distance calls would see a sizeable drop in their bill, said FCC and industry officials.
But wireless phone subscribers could pay anywhere from one percent to two percent more a month through new fees. Customers with more than one phone line for a computer or the kids and who make few long-distance calls would see a monthly rate rise of around $1 or more.  
""We're cutting away the frills,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in an interview. He is a big advocate of the rules under consideration that are expected to be voted on next week.
""We're talking about a $1 subsidy per month that we're eliminating for somebody who's connecting a $2,500 computer to that line and purchasing $20 a month of unlimited access,"" Hunt said.
Instead of a government-imposed cut, the FCC plans to rely on market powers to lower access charges over time, said FCC and industry officials. That could mean an FCC-imposed loss of Bell revenues of no more than $1 billion the first year.
FCC officials, meanwhile, say the plan would yield a cut in long-distance charges of more than $1 billion in year one.  
FCC officials are against a steep cut for several reasons.
Citing rate hikes by AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp late last year, they fear long-distance carriers may not fully pass on the cut to consumers and pocket some of the money. Long-distance executives vow to pass on the cuts.
FCC officials also fear a sharp cut would unleash a rise in local phone rates by carriers trying to recoup lost money.
""We're keeping basic residential dial tone at today's price,"" said Hundt.
Critics charge the plan -- which could still change before next week -- would mean higher rates. AT&amp;T says long-distance customers will see a $1.5 billion jump at the outset in July.
""Regulators appear unlikely to squeeze the fat out of the Bells' prices, leaving consumers paying for inflated rates,"" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union.
But Hundt says that over the next five years at least $10 billion ""will be transferred to consumers"" via access cuts.
The plan also would pay for $3 billion to connect schools, libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet and provide cheap phone service for the poor.  
Access charges were created after the 1984 breakup of Ma Bell. Experts agree the $23 billion is more than the cost of providing access to the local phone network. But they cannot agree on the amount.
FCC officials said 85 percent of the nation's 80 million residential phone customers would see a lower monthly bill.
Those who make lots of long-distance calls would benefit the most, because the agency plans to replace some of the existing per-minute access charges with a monthly flat rate.
The 15 percent of residents who do not make long-distance calls would see their bills stay the same. The monthly flat rate ""subscriber line charge"" customers pay to the local phone company is likely to remain $3.50.
But customers with more than one line and who make few long-distance calls are likely to see a rate rise.
That's because the ceiling, or cap, on the subscriber line charge is expected to rise to $5 a month from $3.50 for each additional residential line, and to roughly $7 a line for multi-line business customers from $6 a month.
One possible way around the charge may be for customers to list their additional lines in a different name or use another local carrier, said industry officials.  
Meanwhile, large businesses or consumers who make a lot of long-distance calls could well see a drop in their phone bill because the FCC plans to lower the permanent access charge to about two cents a minute from about 5.4 cents.
To make up the lost revenues, the FCC plans to require long-distance carriers to pay local carriers a new monthly ""pre-subscribed line charge"" for each long-distance customer.
The charge -- which will range from 75 cents a month for single-line residents to $4.50 a month a line for multi-line businesses -- are intended to better reflect the actual costs of using the local phone network.

40,"The high-energy debate over the television industry's new ratings system moved Thursday to Capitol Hill, where several lawmakers argued the system is flawed -- and some warned a government fix may be necessary.
Industry executives, in an apparent softening of their own position, stressed that the system, barely two months old, is ""a work in progress"" and that they are not immune to change.
""I have no line in the sand,"" Motion Picture Association of America President Jack Valenti told reporters after the Senate Commerce Committee held the first congressional hearings on the age-based ratings. They began airing on network and cable-TV on Jan. 1 at the beginning of programmes.
""We will probably make changes as we go down the line,"" added Valenti, who headed the effort to develop the ratings.
He said some shows probably will be rerated to provide more consistency and that some tinkering is possible, like lengthening the time a rating is shown for a programme. But he did not suggest major revisions as demanded by many lawmakers.
The latest criticism -- backed up with the threat of legislation -- is sure to put pressure on the TV industry.
Lawmakers from both parties contended the ratings are inadequate and that industry executives should adopt a content-based system that spells out the level of sex, violence and strong language in a programme.
They complained that the vast majority of shows receive a middle-of-the road TV-PG rating -- parental guidance suggested -- even though the amount of sex, violence and foul language varies greatly from show to show within that category.
""The current TV ratings system is a little bit like putting a sign up in front of shark-infested waters that says: 'Be careful when swimming,'"" Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, told the Senate Commerce Committee.
Training his sights on Hollywood and TV executives, he warned, ""Don't force us to legislate again in this area.""
The ratings stem from last year's big communications law.
In December, a group of industry executives adopted six categories: TV-G, suitable for all ages; TV-PG, parental guidance suggested; TV-14, parents of children under 14 strongly cautioned; TV-M, mature audiences only; and two categories applying to children's shows: TV-Y, suitable for all children; TV-Y7, suitable for kids age seven and older.
Already, some lawmakers are pushing new laws to alter the system and TV programming.
Sen. Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, said he will offer a bill to require the TV industry to adopt a content-based system -- a move that industry executives have vowed to fight in court ""in a nanosecond"" on First Amendment grounds.
""We don't want Hollywood telling parents what is age-appropriate. We just want Hollywood telling parents what is in their shows,"" Coats told the hearing. His bill also would bar the government from giving TV stations a free channel in the transition to high-definition digital TV.
Others want a law to impose a ""safe harbour"" period, so that violent shows could be shown only later in the evening unless they carried a specific content-based rating.
But some lawmakers warned against government meddling with the ratings system and said it should be given a chance.
""There are ways to improve what we have here,"" said Sen. John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat. He said it should not be government's job to replace parents in the role of screening shows for children.
Valenti likened the system's criticism to judging the career of a new senator ""by the performance of his first 56 days in office.""
Eddie Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, indicated the system could be changed in the face of major grass-roots criticism. ""It's a work in progress.""
"
40,"Regulators Wednesday approved a sweeping overhaul of domestic telephone charges that they said will lower costs for residential and business customers who make a lot of long-distance calls.
Federal Communications Commimssion officials said basic local phone rates will stay the same. But consumers and businesses will pay more for extra phone lines and may see their bills rise if they make few long-distance calls.
The FCC also voted to set aside about $2.3 billion a year to wire the nation's schools and libraries to the Internet at discounted rates. Another $400 million a year will be used to connect rural hospitals to the global computer network.
The new rates mean residential customers with one phone line will see their long-distance bill drop to $20.65 a month from $22.50 by 1998, on average, according to FCC calculations.
""This is the single best day that business and residential customers have had since the (1984) breakup of AT&amp;T,"" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.
The overhaul also will:
-- Keep the monthly ""subscriber line charge"" customers pay to the local phone company at $3.50.
-- Boost the line charge for residential customers with more than one line to $5 a month from $3.50, and to more than $7.50 from $6 for multi-line businesses. Those increases will take effect next year and be followed by additional rises that ultimately will be capped at $9.
-- Impose a new monthly charge on long-distance carriers that is expected to be passed on to customers. The charge will be $1.50 a line for multi-line residential customers and $2.75 a line for businesses with more than one line.
-- Reduce by $1.7 billion the $23 billion in annual charges long-distance carriers pay local companies to access their networks, effective July 1.
-- Reduce access charges by a total of $18.5 billion over the next five years.
AT&amp;T Corp. has promised to pass on the savings in access charges to customers through long-distance price cuts of 5 percent to 15 percent. Other long-distance carriers have signalled they will follow suit.
Phone companies gave the rate overhaul mixed ratings.
AT&amp;T generally praised the plan, but No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp. said the access charge reductions did not go far enough.
Regional phone compannies Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp., which are merging, questioned the access-charge rate cut.
Industry analysts, meanwhile, also offered mixed views.
""There was a lot of huffing and puffing, but this is incremental change and not revolutionary change,"" said Scott Cleland of Schwab Research Group.
"
40,"Television industry moguls crafting a ratings system should spell out sexual and violence content of shows, not rely solely on a system like the motion picture code, a survey of parents issued Thursday concluded.
The nationwide survey of 679 parents showed 80 percent preferred a system that specified the level of violence, sex or bad language rather than the age group for which a program is intended, as the motion picture industry's 28-year-old system does for movies.
The survey was a joint effort of the National Parent Teacher Association, the Institute for Mental Health Initiatives and University of Wisconsin researchers. It came as TV executives raced to complete a ratings system in the next month.
The executives favor an approach like the alphabetical code used by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for movies. Individual networks would rate their shows.
But the survey sponsors -- along with Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. -- want a system that covers content and viewer age.
""Parents want it all. They want every shred of information available about every program,"" said Markey, the author of a provision in the new communications law requiring TV makers to install a ""V-chip"" in all new sets. The device can be used with the upcoming ratings to let parents block shows they consider too violent or racy.
Markey told a news conference it would be ""very unfortunate"" if the TV industry ignored the survey results and did not incorporate the kind of system used by the Home Box Office cable-TV movie channel to rate its shows. Each HBO show is given a rating based on content such as ""MV"" for ""mild violence"" or ""SC"" for ""strong sexual content.""
Markey vowed the groups sponsoring the poll would ""scream to the high heavens"" if the TV ratings ignored program content.
MPAA President Jack Valenti, overseeing the ratings' creation, said his group welcomed all suggestions. ""We are trying to devise a TV parental guidance system which will be family friendly, easy to understand, easy to use, and most of all grounded in honorable purposes so that parents can better monitor and supervise the TV watching of their children.""

40,"Alcohol and tobacco companies are capitalising on the Internet's popularity and flashy graphics to promote products in cyberspace in ways that appeal to underage youth, said a report issued Thursday.
The Centre for Media Education (CME), a children's advocacy group, called on Congress, federal regulators and health officials to probe the promotions, saying some may be illegal. The Federal Trade Commission already is probing television liquor and beer ads.
""Urgent action is needed to ensure that effective safeguards are put in place to protect young people from the harmful effects of online marketing of alcohol and tobacco,"" said the report.
""Many of these new forms of advertising, of particular appeal to youth, appear to be inherently unfair and deceptive."" Industry officials deny they are targeting youth.
""There's nothing on the Budweiser Web site that a family wouldn't see on an Anheuser-Busch brewery tour,"" countered Jack Dougherty, spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. BUD.N , which produces Budweiser beer. He said the company's Web site targets beer drinkers age 21 and older.
The study said alcoholic beverage companies, in particular, have moved to establish sites on the World Wide Web, the multimedia portion of the Internet. It said more than 35 major brands are represented, including Moet &amp; Chandon champagne, Smirnoff's vodka, Dewars scotch whiskey, Samuel Adams beer, Captain Morgan rum, and other products.
The study cited marketing and promotion techniques that use the colourful, interactive features of the Web in ways that appeal to young people. It identified the following:
-- The Budweiser online radio network, ""KBUD,"" which weaves music, rock-star interviews, and music reviews together with beer promotions.
-- Web sites offering interactive games that feature brand characters, including Molson Breweries' ""Berserk in Banff"" and Jose Cuervo tequila's ""J.C. Roadhog Adventure."" Molson is owned 40 percent by Molson Cos. Ltd.  MOLa.TO, 40 percent by Foster's Brewing Group Ltd., and 20 percent by Philip Morris Cos. Inc.
The Cuervo site involves an off-road ride with a ""cyberrodent"" who drives across a desert strewn with empty tequila bottles and other Curevo merchandising icons.
-- Liquor sites with ""bridge drink"" recipes that disguise alcohol's taste and are more appealing to novice drinkers.
-- Numerous sites offering wine, beer, distilled spirits and tobacco products for sale with few or no questions asked.
Regulatory curbs and fears of political backlash have kept most big tobacco companies from launching advertising Web sites, according to the study. But that may change, it added.
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a subsidiary of B.A.T Industries Plc, recently began running print ads for its Lucky Strike cigarettes in the San Francisco area in a bid to entice new visitors to the Web site for ""Circuit Breaker,"" an online magazine that collects data on smoking habits and offers free T-shirts.
Brown &amp; Williamson, in response, said the Web site ""promotes awareness of events in the San Francisco Bay Area, such as bar nights and adult-oriented concerts.""
""The Web site does not contain tobacco advertising or cigarette logos because we're promoting awareness of the events, not cigarettes,"" the company added.
The study also said some tobacco companies have launched Web sites in other countries, such as Germany, that can be accessed easily from the United States.
""The cigarette industry should refrain from moving onto the Internet to market and promote its products,"" said the CME's Jeffrey Chester. ""If companies fail to comply with the Cigarette Act, appropriate legal action should be taken.""
The 1971 law bars cigarette ads on TV and radio and, according to the CME, is applicable to the Internet.

40,"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas refused Thursday to reinstate landmark federal rules aimed at prying open the nation's $100 billion local telephone market to full-fledged competition.
Thomas let stand, without comment, a U.S. appeals court order suspending key parts of the Federal Communications Commission's ""interconnection"" rules. The FCC, long-distance giants AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., and other phone companies had asked Thomas to restore the rules, but he rejected the request.
The FCC and the long-distance companies immediately submitted a new request for the high court to lift the lower court's ""stay."" The matter is expected to be taken up by the entire Supreme Court for consideration. In the meantime, deregulation of the nation's local phone monopolies remains in legal limbo.
The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in St. Louis, issued its stay on Oct. 15 while it considers a challenge to the rules, which spell out how long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others can link up to the local phone market under the new telecommunications law. Oral arguments are set for January.
GTE Corp., the Baby Bell phone companies, other local carriers and state regulators want to overturn the rules, saying the FCC overstepped its authority and usurped state powers to issue policies on pricing and other matters. Local companies and state regulators had requested the stay.
""We're gratified that the court declined to lift the stay. We are anticipating that the appeals process (against the FCC rules) will go forward and we think that is the right decision,"" said Bell Atlantic Corp. spokesman Jay Grossman.
The FCC and the long-distance companies had told the high court the stay ran counter to the telecom law and would hurt consumers by delaying the introduction of competition in the local market.
Thomas oversees appeals from the St. Louis-based appeals court.
The FCC rules, adopted in August, are intended to serve as a guide to negotiations between local phone companies and new rivals seeking to enter the local market.
They also are intended to serve as a reference for state arbitrators overseeing stalled negotiations.
The FCC rules, among other things, require the Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.
With the stay in place, state regulators will hold sway in determining what pricing and other policies will apply to the interconnection agreements between the Bells and GTE and new market entrants. Regulators in several states already have begun to issue preliminary arbitration agreements.
Scott Cleland, an analyst at the Washington Research Group, said the decision to leave the stay in place throws the process of telecommunications deregulation into uncertainty.
""It decentralizes the deregulation process down to the states and injects a lot of potential uncertainty over time,"" he said.
"
40,"Regulators are considering extending consumer safeguards for 900-number phone calls to other pay-per-call services that have zapped unwitting consumers with sky-high phone bills for overseas calls.
The Federal Trade Commission Wednesday said it will seek public comment on whether to apply the rules to information and entertainment services that callers dial though a prefix other than ""900."" The 900-number rules require clear cost disclosures and a means for settling billing disputes.
The newer services offer callers astrological and travel information, psychic advice and phone sex, among other things. Scams among ""audio information"" or ""audio entertainment"" services are a growing problem, according to one official.
Officials say providers of the services evade the 900 rules, adopted in 1992, by diverting calls to numbers in such countries as Guyana, the Dominican Republic, the tiny African country of Sao Tome, or the former Soviet Republic of Moldova.
In some cases the first three digits of the number -- such as 809, 758 or 664 -- resemble area codes in this country.
The difference: The overseas calls wind up in countries where the local phone company levies a charge of more than $2 a minute for completing the call. The rate far exceeds costs.
Government officials said this allowed the overseas phone company to provide a ""kickback"" to the pay-per-call service for each call sent abroad, payments that can drum up business.
""It has probably helped them to establish a modern telephone system,"" one FTC official said of the foreign phone companies.
Last year's overhaul of U.S. telecommunication law gave the FTC the authority to expand its 900-number rules to cover similar services not accessed by dialing 900.
Those rules give consumers three seconds to hang up after listening to a message disclosing the cost of the service.
A service also must spell out its costs. Calls that cost more than $2 must start with a message disclosing the price and identifying the name of the service.
The rules also ensure that consumers will not lose their phone service if they fail to pay for a 900 call. They also establish a mechanism for settling billing disputes.
The FTC recently brought a number of cases against alleged international pay-per-call schemes and has issued consumer alerts warning of the costs and risks of such services.
Last month it closed three steamy sites on the Internet after consumers complained of huge phone bills to Moldova.
The agency alleged that Audiotex Connection of Long Island, N.Y., and others distributed a sophisticted computer programme that -- unbeknownst to consumers -- caused a computer user's modem to disconnect from their local Internet access company and dial an overseas pay-per-call number to the former Soviet Republic. A lawyer for those involved denied wrongdoing.
Tim Elliott, president of the TeleServices Industry Association, said new rules were not necessarily needed for his industry. ""We police ourselves. It's pretty effective.""
He conceded, ""There are a lot of folks involved in the industry that are -- I don't want to say shady -- but who push the envelope.""
"
40,"Federal regulators are set to kick off a two-part plan to slash rates on overseas phone calls, a move that could save consumers and companies billions of dollars but may ruffle the feathers of foreign governments.
The Federal Communications Commission is expected Tuesday to make it simpler for U.S. and foreign phone companies to negotiate cheaper rates for international calls to and from the United States.
Next month the FCC is expected to propose rules to cut the charges U.S. carriers pay foreign phone monopolies to complete overseas calls made from the United States.
""The ultimate goal is to get lower-priced and better-quality services for consumers,"" said Don Gips, head of the FCC's international bureau.
Officials say the foreign charges, or ""accounting rates,"" run five to 10 times actual costs, reflecting the power of state-run monopolies unexposed to home competition. Monopolies control more than 90 percent of the non-U.S. market.
U.S. phone companies, as a result, paid their overseas counterparts $5.5 billion more in 1995 than foreign companies paid U.S. carriers to complete calls.
""This figure would drop in half overnight if American carriers simply paid fees even vaguely related to costs,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in a recent speech. He noted that the imbalance dwarfs the U.S. foreign aid budget of $2 billion.
The United States has big imbalances with China, Jamaica, Mexico, Hong Kong, Columbia and Argentina, among others.
""Those few countries trying to defend their monopolies are going to be nervous"" about the FCC effort, said Dan Rosen of the Institute for International Economics.
U.S. carriers support the strategy.
""You've got to move accounting rates to cost,"" said AT&amp;T Corp. Vice President Gerry Salemme. AT&amp;T said it must pay 45 cents a minute to have its calls connected to the Dominican Republic, but that the actual cost is 7 to 8 cents a minute.
The FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organisation.
To cut rates and open markets, the FCC is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. Tuesday's order is meant for open markets, such as those in Britain, Canada and Chile.
The FCC will waive its ""proportionate return"" rules that limit the ability of U.S. and foreign carriers to negotiate lower rates for overseas calls. To win a waiver, a foreign carrier's home market must be open to competition.
The existing rules require overseas companies to turn over their long-distance calls to U.S. carriers in the same proportion U.S. carriers send calls to a foreign carrier's home market.
If AT&amp;T, for example, accounts for 60 percent of calls to a country, then that country's monopoly must hand off 60 percent of its U.S.-bound calls to AT&amp;T.
The FCC proposal due next month would set ""benchmark"" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs.
The agency must still work out the details of how long a country would have to lower its rates and what steps could be taken if it refused to do so.
""It literally has the potential of saving consumers billions of dollars,"" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.
But the plan could rub governments the wrong way. High rates charged by their own phone monopolies can be used to maintain bloated payrolls or to subsidise local phone service.

40,"After years of delay, regulators are set to announce approval of plans to create a new type of radio service that offers CD-quality sound and can be heard by listeners coast-to-coast, government officials said Friday.
The four members of the Federal Communications Commission have resolved long-standing differences over allocating the two available radio licenses to the four companies seeking to offer so-called Digital Audio Radio Service, or DARS.  
The four are: CD Radio Inc.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp.; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp.; and Primosphere.
An official who requested anonymity said the FCC approval is expected to be announced soon, possibly later Friday or on Monday.
Despite reservations from two commissioners, the agency has decided to limit an auction of the two licenses to the four companies -- which had filed applications with the FCC in the early 1990s.  
On Monday, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt had raised the specter of a potential snag. He insisted an auction should be open to any company that wants to bid, instead of the existing four.
Such a wide-open auction could have raised a more money for the government by attracting more bidders.
Hundt noted that MCI Communications Corp last year paid $683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programs nationwide.
But the government officials said that the commissioners finally decided to allow the limited auction to proceed, given that the applicants have been waiting for years.

40,"The nation's top communications regulator said Tuesday he will resign as head of the Federal Communications Commission.
Saying he wanted to spend more time with his family and complete two books, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said he asked President Bill Clinton to begin looking for a replacement. Hundt's term does not expire until June 30, 1998.
The new FCC chief must be cleared by the Senate. Hundt, who said he does not yet have future professional plans, will remain a voting member of the five-member FCC in the meantime.
He said he will remain as FCC chairman until a successor is installed.
""I expect that I'll be here for some time yet,"" Hundt, 49, told a news conference. ""I don't have any plans with anybody whatsoever.""
Hundt, a close ally of Vice President Al Gore, became chairman in November 1993. During his controversial 3-1/2-year tenure to date, he has presided over implementing last year's big communications law and requiring television broadcasters to air 3 hours a week of educational TV for children.
Among those considered possible successors are Susan Ness, a current FCC commissioner, and the agency's general counsel, William Kennard. Clinton nominated Kennard last Friday to fill one of two commissioner slots already vacant.
Other possible replacements include: Kathy Wallman, now a senior White House economic aide and formerly the head of the FCC's common carrier bureau; and Ralph Everett, a Washington attorney and former Senate staff member.
""Chairman Hundt has been a strong and visionary leader of the FCC during this historic period in telecommunications policy,"" Clinton said in a statement.
Clinton praised Hundt's ""steadfast commitment to the public interest and to bringing the benefits of competition to consumers.""
Hundt's departure -- and the arrival of new commissioners in coming months -- are expected to generate new uncertainties about federal communications policy.
""It could potentially be a huge change,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Legg Mason Precursor, a unit of the brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc. ""If it's anything like previous transitions, (FCC) chairmen can reinvent the wheel.""
Hundt has moved aggressively to implement last year's communications law and pry open local phone monopolies to competition -- although a key part of that effort is embroiled in a court fight against regional Baby Bell phone companies.
Hundt also has overseen the granting of free licenses to TV stations for the introduction of high-definition digital TV and moved to open foreign markets to competition.
""He is in no small part responsible for the pro-competitive revolution in telecommunications that is sweeping the globe,"" said attorney Scott Harris of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.
But Hundt often clashed with key members of Congress and the Baby Bells, who complained that his FCC policies amounted to micro-managing of the communications industry.
""His departure is fitting and timely,"" said Representative W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin, R-La., adding that Hundt ""remains a good friend and a person I deeply respect"" despite policy differences between the two.
Tauzin, the head of the powerful House Telecommunications Subcommittee, told Reuters that under the next chairman the FCC has ""got to be an agency that tries to downsize itself and its influence on the industry.""
Broadcasters also have criticised Hundt's policies.
But consumer advocates generally have praised Hundt's stands on issues ranging from children's TV to opening the $100 billion local phone market to competition.

38,"British life assurer Scottish Amicable said on Thursday it planned to shed its 170-year-old mutual status in favour of a stock market flotation aimed at taking advantage of opportunities for profit growth.
The Stirling-based group outlined plans to float on the London Stock Exchange in three to five years' time and said it would pay policy-holders an initial special bonus of 75 million pounds ($125 million) after demutualising on May 1.
Scottish Amicable said pay-outs would be based on the length of time policies had been held by members.
The fist payment would be followed by benefits worth more than 200 million pounds as a result of flotation, which will give the group access to long-term capital, it added.
The group said it expected to have a market capitalisation of around 1.0 billion pounds on flotation.
Scottish Amicable said significant opportunities existed for profitable growth in its businesses. But it said in a statement that to take full advantage ""requires access to external capital in both the short and long term.""
There has been intense speculation that Scottish Amicable, founded in 1826, would be the subject of a takeover bid but chairman Sandy Stewart said the group intended to hold on to its independence.
""Our plans do not include being gobbled up by anybody,"" he told a news briefing.
The group said the process would be in two stages. Under the plan, the business, staff and operations of the group would be transferred to a new company, Scottish Amicable Life, a 100 percent subsidiary of newly formed Scottish Amicable Holdings.
The first stage involves a deal with reinsurance giant Swiss Re and its affiliate Securitas Capital ""to provide substantial financial backing initially totalling 395 million pounds"".
Under this agreement Scottish Amicable's existing with-profit fund will receive an immediate cash contribution of 350 million pounds ""from the reinsurance by Swiss Re of certain categories of existing policy"".
Securitas Capital has committed to invest up to 45 million pounds in return for approximately 20 percent of a new business fund being set up to transact all new business from the date on which the scheme becomes effective.
Swiss Re has also agreed to provide further reinsurance ""expected to reach a level of 150 million pounds over the next five years in respect of future new business"".
Scottish Amicable said Roy Nicolson, currently managing director of the group, would become group chief executive of Scottish Amicable Holdings, while Paul Bradshaw, deputy managing director, will become chief executive of Scottish Amicable Life.
Policyholders must first approve the plans at a special general meeting expected to be held in March. The group said detailed discussions had already been held with Britain's Department of Trade and Industry. ($1=.5958 Pound)

38,"Lloyd's of London announced on Tuesday it is to give Names more time to meet planned increases in the capital they must put up to support their underwriting activities.
Lloyd's has also dropped proposals to prevent Names - the traditional backers of the insurance market - using their own homes as collateral for underwriting.
The planned capital increases are part of a package of measures designed to strengthen the financial security that underpins Lloyd's and to provide a level playing field between Names and corporate members.
The longer transition period for the changes announced today may go some way to meeting the concerns of Names' representatives who had called for more time to be given to meet the new capital requirements.
Names fear they are gradually being forced out of the market in favour of corporate capital first introduced in 1994, a charge repeatedly denied by the Lloyd's hierachy.
Names are to be given three years before they have to meet the new requirements of showing evidence of assets amounting to 50 percent of the premiums they underwrite.
In a Lloyd's working party report last month a two-year transition period was proposed but, after consultations, that has been extended from 1999 to the year 2000.
A phased increase in Names' minimum level of means to 350,000 pounds ($571,000) from the current level of 250,000 pounds has also been increased from two to five years and will come into force in 2002.
This 350,000 pounds will be made up of funds held at Lloyd's and evidence of ""other personal wealth"" (OPW).
Proposals to double the OPW requirements for 2000 and beyond have been dropped in favour of a slightly higher level of funds which must be held at Lloyd's.
At present Names must put up between 20 and 30 percent of the total business they back compared with 50 percent for corporate members.
By 2000, Names will have to hold 40 percent of premium capacity at Lloyd's with OPW making up a further 10 percent, bringing them into line with corporate members.
The use of ""principal private residences"" (PPRs) - Names' own homes - as collateral for members' underwriting are to be allowed to continue but only for those in existence at the end of 1994.
No new PPR backed guarantees may be introduced in the future nor existing one increased.
Risk assessment is to be extended to all members from  1998 onward and may require higher capital levels for members with greater risk exposure.
This is expected to affect less than 10 percent of individual members.
The Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM), which represents Names' interests, broadly welcomed today's proposals, saying it was essential that all Names should demonstrate their ability to meet any losses they incurred.
Lloyd's proposals coincided with the publication of an independent report commissioned by the Market Interests Group - an alliance of the ALM, member agents and Lloyd's brokers.
It acknowledged that reform in particular of the annual venture and management of Names' based capital was important, but said that creating an environment that encouraged their disappearance would be a significant mistake.
Earlier on Friday a leading figure in Lloyd's called for the capital structure of the market to be simplified.
Robert Hiscox, chairman of insurance group Hiscox Plc described the annual venture - where syndicates are reformed anew every year - as an ""anachronistic absurdity"" and said the current mixture of unlimited and limited members was too expensive to maintain. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)

38,"Composite insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Group Plc on Thursday reported lower results in its first year since it merged and said it would seek shareholder approval to buy in up to five percent of its shares.
But large provisions for U.S. environmental claims and the impact of the pound's strength took the gloss off the figures reported by the group, formed in a six billion pound ($9.7 billion) merger last year.
Including the increased provisions and 32 million pounds for currency movements, operating profits fell to 706 million pounds from 915 million in 1995 for the combined group.
After an initial gain on the buyback news, the shares closed down 9-1/2 pence at 494 pence.
A lower-than-expected net asset value and a poor performance in the British motor insurance market compounded the market's disappointment.
The 167 million pounds in provisions, largely put aside for U.S. asbestos and environmental claims dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, follows a change in the way the group assesses possible liabilities.
On Wednesday, B.A.T Industries subsidiary Eagle Star set aside 160 million pounds in a similar move.
Both companies have said that they expect it to mark the end to such provisioning.
The dividend for the year was raised to 19 pence per share in line with last year's management forecasts.
The operating figures did not include 201 million pounds relating to consolidation costs, some 30 or 40 million more than analysts had expected.
But management declared themselves pleased with the results and said the group remained on target to achieve the annual cost savings of at least 175 million pounds identified at the time of the merger.
Chief executive Richard Gamble said the integration was progressing well, especially on the staffing front, and the group was continuing to hold on to business.
But he played down the possibility of an acquisition to strengthen its life operations or exposure to Continental Europe, emphasising that the current focus was on integration.
The group had decided to buy back shares in anticipation of continued strengthening of its capital position, said deputy chairman Roger Taylor, who hinted that it could be repeated in the future.
The company will need shareholders' permission at the annual meeting in May before it can carry out the buyback.
U.S. weather costs mirrored the experience of competitors who have all highlighted the impact on profits of some of the worst weather on record in North America last year.
U.S. weather losses at 96 million pounds were 36 million higher for the year. Together with the reserving for environmental claims, this turned a 134 million pound profit in 1995 into a 14 million pound loss.
Profits for the general insurance business as a whole after the changes in claims reserving were 480 million pounds, down from 754 million in 1995.
In Britain, a 28 percent fall in profits reflected an increase in the frequency and average cost of personal lines claims -- motor claims frequency was up eight percent and costs seven percent -- and continuing competition.
The figures also included an unexpected 50 million pound increase in reserves split between reinsurance of the U.S. environmental costs and domestic insurance indemnity.
On a brighter note, Royal &amp; Sun said it was confident motor rates had bottomed out and was scheduling increases for 1997.
Worldwide life profits increased by 15 percent to 213 million pounds and were up 13 percent to 150 million pounds in Britain.
The company said it was appointing Patrick Gillam, chairman of Standard Chartered bank, as non-executive chairman from May 9. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds)

38,"Britain's NatWest Group said on Thursday it was setting up a new business grouping, NatWest Wealth Management, to tap the potential of private banking, long-term savings and investment markets.
The unit will bring together asset management company Gartmore, life insurance and pensions unit NatWest Life and Investment Services and NatWest Ventures.
Private banking unit Coutts Group will join the new arm in January 1998 following the completion of a restructuring process.
NatWest group chief executive Derek Wanless said the new business offered ""potentially very strong growth"" for the group.
""It's a market with major growth potential because of demographic changes, people's need to save for sickness and old age,"" he said in an interview.
""It's an area where we've put a fair number of the building blocks in place over the past few years, particularly last year, when we bought Gartmore and integrated it with our own investment management company.""
NatWest Wealth Management will have funds in excess of 60 billion pounds ($98 billion) under management.
It will be positioned to offer a comprehensive range of products and services to clients, ranging from the private investor through to the most sophisticated pension fund sponsor.
Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, Britain's fifth-largest fund manager, which NatWest acquired in April 1996, will be chief executive of the new unit from April 1 and will report directly to Wanless.
Myners said the businesses in the new group were already well-established and successful and together represented a ""substantial force in the provision of long-term savings and investment products"".
Wealth management was a significant market for the group's future and the creation of a dedicated sector represented a logical progression of its strategy, said Wanless.
It was also looking to ensure it got the best out of combining the Gartmore and NatWest brands and making use of the groups' distribution channels to independent financial advisers (IFAs).
""Cost savings were essentially in the integration of Gartmore and NatWest investment management which took place last year. The benefits are really on the growth side; the income, not the cost side of the business,"" Wanless said.
""It has no negative implications for headcount. We genuinely think this is a growth opportunity where we're growing together some interesting businesses both in terms of distribution and fund mangement.""
He said that last year's investment in Gartmore was the principal building block from outside needed for the move and that it was now substantially a case of organic growth, building the distribution channels and capitalising on the other strengths of NatWest UK and Coutts. ($1=.6120 Pound)

38,"Britain's United Assurance Group, created by the merger of Refuge and United Friendly last October, said on Thursday 2,200 jobs would be lost as a result of integration, some 400 more than had been originally expected.
The company, Britain's fourth largest home services insurer -- selling through agents who visit customers homes, said last August that it expected around a quarter of the group's 7,100 employees would lose their jobs.
United is planning to close over half its offices in an effort to cut costs by around 37 million pounds ($60 million) a year.
Group chief executive George Mack said that the opportunities to make cost savings and achieve economies of scale were essential in enabling it to compete in its chosen businesses.
The rationalisation and integration will involve an eventual reduction in the group's regional and branch offices to 116 from 279.
United has set aside 76.3 million pounds for the expected integration costs.
The new structure would enable greater emphasis to be placed on clients' needs, the company said.
Mack declined to rule out further job losses but told Reuters that any reductions were unlikely to be material in the near term.
""We are looking to make sure we're lean and efficient in our back offices and strong and expanding on our sales force front... if anything we're looking to expand our sales force,"" he said.
The group has yet to get a response from the Department of Trade and Industry to its proposals that the costs for the restructuring be borne by shareholders. Under its plans shareholders would receive a greater return for taking on the additional risk.
The news of the lay-offs cames as the merged group announced pre-tax profits of 549.3 million pounds for 1996, which included 430 million pounds from the transfer of 'orphan assets' -- surplus insurance funds -- to shareholders.
United shares rose on the figures, adding 11-1/2 pence to 485-1/2.
Excluding net exceptional items of 371.3 million pounds, profits from continuing operations were up 18 percent at 193.5 million pounds.
The dividend for the year was raised 35 percent to 18 pence per share.
Run-off costs from the closure of the group's motor business to new business in 1996 had been higher than expected with the pre-tax loss of 15.5 million pounds reflecting the effect of an adverse increase in the number of claims and value of settlements.
Efforts would now be concentrated on the household busines which United said offered ""great potential"" to the enlarged group.
""We've had a less good year this year than last. Market conditions have been less favourable but we believe we have a strong product range and sound account and with the client base of the combined group we expect to be vigorous in expanding our portfolio,"" said Mack.
Provisions chargeable for the 11,000 cases of possible mis-selling of pensions by the group, remained broadly unchanged at 71 million pounds.
""We will have a clear idea of the level at which we're settling at the end of 1997 but we believe we're appropriately provided for at the moment. Until we have specific settlememnt experience there is some uncertainty in the size of that provision,"" Mack said.
"
38,"British composite insurer Commercial Union Plc on Tuesday announced a major restructuring of its domestic general insurance operations to improve profitability and customer service.
The shake-up is aimed at producing some 100 million pounds ($163.5 million) of savings annually by 1999, largely through the reduction of administration and claims supply chain costs.
But the company was quick to emphasise that no jobs were under threat.
""Provided we meet our overall strategic objectives there won't be any compulsory redundancies. There is no hidden agenda here to lose jobs,"" said Andy Homer, manager of Commercial Union's UK general insurance division.
Dubbed 'Market Orientation', the changes will see head office functions reorganised into customer-focused trading units built around specific market segments and distribution channels, the company said.
There will be nine new trading units, each focused on one market sector. They will handle product development, underwriting, marketing and delivery.
Underwriters, marketers, finance and information technology staff will all work in teams, with the task of focusing on customer needs and Commercial Union believes it is the first British insurer to take this cross-functional approach.
""Market Orientation will create an innovative, team-based commercial culture and ensure that we establish ourselves as the pre-eminent force in the UK insurance market,"" said Cees Schrauwers, managing director of Commercial Union non-life insurance.
The company hopes to save 40 million pounds through more effective management of the claims supply chain, which accounts for five percent of the 800 million pound annual claims bill.
It already has a sole supplier agreement for windshields with Autoglass.
The benefits will be shared by customers as well as shareholders, Schrauwers said.
Around 40 million pounds of savings are targeted from administration costs through greater use of new technology.
Four of the group's 22 branches -- Liverpool, Manchester Bristol and Southampton -- have already piloted the changes.
Another 20 million pounds are to come from new modelling software to improve pricing and margins.
Many of the costs involved in the programme have already been incurred as normal business expenses, Homer said.
""In 1998 and 1999 we believe we can complete the programme. There's no hidden charge coming up later in the year,"" he said.

38,"British insurance group Norwich Union said on Tuesday it will float on the London Stock Exchange on June 16.
The company, Britain's third largest life insurer, expects to allocate around 1.3 billion free shares to 2.9 million qualifying members as part of its plan to drop its mutual status and become a public limited company.
Norwich also hopes to raise 1.75 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) of fresh capital through an offer of new shares. Existing members will be able to buy the shares at a discount, the size of which will be announced on May 21.
Last month Norwich members voted overwhelmingly in favour of its conversion proposals, the first by a mutually owned British insurer.
The flotation will value it at around five billion pounds, ranking it among the country's 50 largest companies.
Norwich members wishing to participate in the public offering will have to apply for a minimum of 400 pounds worth of shares. There will be an upper ceiling on applications by members of 100,000 pounds.
Non-members, who will not receive any discounts, will have to apply for at least 1,000 pounds worth of shares and those registering with the Norwich will be sent a mini-prospectus from May 21.
Around 1.5 billion pounds of the money raised will go into the existing with-profits fund to enable the company to keep up benefits to policyholders.
The balance, less the 120 million pound cost of the flotation, will be used for corporate purposes.
Around 1.8 million ""with profit"" members will net an average of 800 pounds worth of free shares under the plans. They will receive a minimum of 300 shares with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policies as at October 1, 1996.
Another one million ""non-profit"" policyholders will receive a fixed allocation of 150 shares worth between 330 and 400 pounds.
Norwich sent British and Irish members a booklet today, providing information on how to buy shares at a discount.
Application forms and a mini-prospectus will be sent to members along with details of the size of the discount on May 21.
A June 10 deadline has been set for the return of the forms and payment ahead of the start of trading in the shares on June 16.
Norwich said it was setting up a single company personal equity plan (PEP) for which there will be no initial charge. For plans opened within 42 days of flotation, the first year's management fee will be waived. ($ = 0.618 British Pounds)

38,"Insurance group Guardian Royal Exchange Plc on Tuesday blamed competition and bad weather in the United States and Britain for a sharp fall in trading profits for 1996.
But despite continuing pressures on margins, Guardian chief executive John Robins said there were bright spots.
The company had seen some hardening of premiums in selected sectors and regions such as British motor insurance, and difficult conditions in Germany had not been as severe as had some commentators had forecast.
Trading profits for the year, however, were down over 17 percent at 281 million pounds ($458 million), before restructuring costs of 39 million pounds.
Pre-tax profits including investment gains dropped to 651 million pounds from 812 million pounds last year. Worldwide general insurance premium income was broadly unchanged at 2.91 billion pounds.
The figures were broadly in line with market expectations and Guardian shares were trading eight pence higher at 296 pence by mid-morning.
The dividend payout for the year was raised by 11 percent to 10.0 pence per share.
Robins said the results were achieved amid continuing competitive pressure, abnormally bad weather in North America and adverse weather and continuing subsidence costs in Britain.
But finance director James Morley told Reuters that the group expected premiums in the motor and household insurance markets to strengthen in the coming year although commercial rates were expected to continue to be weak.
""In UK household during 1996 we saw a rating environment where prices were going down. The particularly cold spell at the beginning of the year will have reminded people not to underprice household and we would expect the second half of the year to be flattish or slightly positive,"" said Morley.
Guardian said it wanted its business to grow organically and by acquisition. But it was not prepared to overpay and was determined to write for profit, not volume.
The results included a second half provision for the integration of the Legal &amp; General business and fundamental restructuring of the British insurance business. Robins said he believed they had achieved a great deal in effectively positioning the group for the future.
A new management structure was set up at the beginning of 1997 and cost savings in the next two years would equal this year's 39 million pounds of exceptional charges.
Those charges are expected to cover all the costs required to complete the restructuring over the next 12 to 18 months.
There will be some facility closures and further staff losses to come, said Morley, but he declined to put an overall figure on the number of likely layoffs.
The company said it continued to withdraw from non-core, non-performing markets and had three objectives -- greater attention to customer needs, greater focus on the cost base and increasing return on shareholders funds.
It continued to target increases in premiums only in sectors and regions where it was confident of profitable growth and acceptable underwriting margins.
""Where we have a strategic benefit from being in a market segment, then we will use our market presence to ensure we get the rate we require over the medium term. In the shorter term we will walk away from certain business if we can't get the right rates,"" said Morley.

38,"Britain's Ladbroke Group Plc Monday concluded a long-awaited global alliance with Hilton Hotels Corp., reuniting the Hilton brand worldwide for the first time in 32 years.
Despite the tie-up, which covers 400 hotels in 49 countries, the two companies denied there was a hidden agenda to progress toward a full merger of the two groups.
""We're taking a first step in bringing the hotels business much closer. We're putting the relationship back together and who knows what may come of it,"" said Ladbroke Chief Executive Peter George.
The companies said the deal covering sales and marketing, frequent customer programmes and development would fuel top-line growth and dispel the confusion that has surrounded the two groups in recent years.
Hilton has operated separately within and outside the U.S. market since 1964, when Hilton International was spun off from HHC.
""From our customers' point of view this will look as if it's one company for the first time in 32 years. For many years we've confused our guests ... They'll now no longer see a difference between a London Hilton and a Hilton in New York,"" said Stephen Bollenbach, chief executive of HHC.
""These two companies will have such a close alliance and so many points of contact with each other that I believe you will get all the benefits of one legal entity whether or not you become one legal entity.""
The reunification would also help both groups capitalise on industry growth and make them more resilient in cyclical downturns, George said.
Announcing the signing of the agreements for the hotel deal, which was first unveiled last summmer, the companies also said a worldwide loyalty programme -- Hilton HHonors Worldwide -- would start Feb. 1.
That would be the single most important marketing link between the two, George said, adding that there was scope for further cooperation in other areas such as gaming.
""There is a gaming provision as well whereby we're looking at doing some gaming projects together,"" said George.
""It's not a deal that involves a great deal of cost savings but the primary benefit is the top line -- it'll be driving revenues. It can be valued in the tens of millions of dollars to each company.""
As expected, the agreements provide for taking cross shareholdings of up to 20 percent. Hilton said it intended to acquire a 5 percent stake in Ladbroke in due course.
Mutual participation in future hotel development will focus primarily on management contracts and franchises, but the companies said it was no longer proposed that each make minority investments in the other's hotel real estate.
"
38,"International insurance broker Willis Corroon, reported a rise in 1996 profits on Thursday but gave a gloomy assessment of the problems of overcapacity and falling rates currently afflicting the industry.
The company said insurance rates were declining almost universally and competition in the U.S. retail market was intensifying.
It also warned that the recent rise in sterling which reduced 1996 profits by 3.1 million pounds ($5.1 million) may hit 1997 results and that profits from its Lloyd's members agency were unlikely to be repeated at the 1996 level.
The comments were made as Willis unveiled pre-tax profits for the year of 91.6 million pounds, a rise of 83 percent over 1995, which included 30 million pounds in exceptional charges.
Stripping out exceptionals and disposals, profits from continuing operations were up 13 percent at 89.1 million pounds.
Willis said it expected to benefit from a programme designed to enhance performance and competitiveness but the shares lost ground after the results, slipping eight pence by early afternoon to 131-1/2 pence.
Analysts said the results merely confirmed the difficulties the sector faced.
Willis chairman John Reeve, however, pointed to the rise in profits and elimination of net debt as evidence of the successful implementation of plans to restore the group's financial health.
""The group is now focused on its core operation, following a programme of disposal, profitability has been improved and the balance sheet has been significantly strengthened,"" Reeve said.
Willis also drew comfort from its success in growing revenues and despite the difficult market conditions. it said it remained sceptical about the benefits of the recent industry trend of pursuing cost economies through mergers.
""We think there are huge risks in people businessses associated with that. We have a strategy for growing our business which we're comfortable with and as far as we're concerned that's what we're concentrating on,"" group executive director Max Taylor told Reuters in an interview.
Following the implementation of the Lloyd's of London Reconstruction and Renewal plan (R&amp;R) the group's members agency returned to profit for the first time since 1992.
The 14.5 million pound profit commission for the 1993 year included reserves from prior years. These were partly offset by contributions of 6.3 million pounds to the R&amp;R plan.
Willis said present indications were that profit commission on the 1994 year, receivable in 1997, will be around half those of 1993.
Profits for the 1995 year were likely to be significantly down, however, said one analyst, and there were big questions over whether it would be profitable at all in 1997 given the rating environment.
After severance costs of 11.3 million pounds in the 1996 figures related to the change programme, Taylor said he expected further costs in 1997 to be lower.
He said a fall in staff numbers of 11 percent in 1996 was unlikely to be repeated and further reductions were expected to be on a smaller scale and absorbed through natural wastage.
The change programme is expected to span three to five years and last year's actions were taken to underpin it. The real effort would now be going into the longer term effort of building capabilities, skills and resources, said Taylor.

24,"The Sydney 2000 Olympics does not appear to be generating the economic bonanza many had hoped for and will not boost Sydney house prices, two construction and real estate forecasters said on Tuesday.
""The impact of the Olympics hasn't been as great as we'd been led to believe,"" Knight Frank Independent director Philip Ragan told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) seminar.
Construction of the games facilities and preparations for the games were in full swing, but were not yet adding significantly to the economy, Ragan said.
In 1993, when the Sydney was awarded the games, analysts forecast that the extra construction, tourism and jobs generated by the games would cumulatively add A$7 billion (US$5.3 billion) to A$8 billion to gross domestic product by 2001.
Ragan said the cumulative economic effect was likely to be closer to A$3 billion because of cost over-runs, lower revenue projections and the leakage of sponsorship revenues offshore.
""The outcome is coming in at the low end of expectations, in fact, significantly lower,"" Ragan said.
Olympics-related job creation had originally been estimated at about 150,000, but only 800 specific jobs had been created so far and only about 2,800 temporary jobs were seen in 2000, he said.
The state government and various private consortia are expected to spend about A$3.2 billion building new facilities.
But Ragan said this amount spent over four years was not a major increase on the A$10 billion spent each year on such construction in Sydney.
An expected nine percent rise in state government revenues and a trend towards higher savings would also swamp the Olympic-led boost to the local economy, he said.
""The effect of the Olympics is being more than overshadowed by other changes happening in the economy,"" he said.
BIS Schrapnel building and construction director Robert Mellor said he expected Sydney property prices to rise almost 40 percent in the lead up to the year 2000 and then slide in the years immediately after the Olympics.
But Mellor said this would have happened regardless of Sydney having the Olympics.
""It's got nothing to do with the Olympics. I don't see it having any effect,"" Mellor told the CEDA seminar.
""The positives may not be as great as the econometric models may indicate,"" he said.
The Atlanta Olympics had shown retailers and street traders had not done nearly as well as expected, Mellor said.
He pointed to the recent rash of legal actions by Atlanta's Olympic vendors against organisers for promising unrealistic likely incomes.
Those residential areas very close to the games site at Homebush Bay in Sydney's Western Suburbs may benefit from the new recreational facilities built there, but the bulk of Sydney's housing market would not notice.
He said the prospect of some home owners being able to rent out their homes for A$1,000 or A$2,000 for two weeks was unlikely to provide a general boost to the market.
""It just doesn't change the fundamental reason for buying a house in Sydney,"" he said.

24,"Australia-based transport equipment hire and logistics firm, Brambles Industries Ltd, reported a 15.8 percent profit lift for the 1995/96 year on Friday despite flat Australian and European economies.
Surging profits from Brambles' U.S. and European CHEP pallet hire joint venture with Britain's GKN Plc compensated for otherwise slow growth from Australia, the company said.  
""The continuing improvement in our performance reflects, in part, the successful retionalisation of our wholly owned businesses and strong growth from our CHEP joint ventures,"" Brambles Chief Executive John Fletcher said.
""CHEP USA, in particular, continues to justify our confidence in its long term growth prospects in the region,"" he said in Bramble's profit statements.
Brambles' net profit rose to A$215.1 million (US$169.9 million) for the year to June 30, 1997 from A$97.7 million in 1994/95, but the previous year's result was undermined by a large abnormal loss.  
Pre-abnormal profits for 1995/96 rose 15.8 percent to A$214.8 million, at the top end of analysts' expectations.
Pre-tax profits rose 13 percent and 30 percent from Europe and the United States respectively, while Australian profits rose eight percent.
""Overseas profits grew at twice the rate in Australia and the trend is likely to continue,"" Fletcher said.
""In particular we expect further contributions from CHEP in Europe and North America,"" he said.  
Fletcher later told Reuters this strong peformance from Bramble's non-Australian operations had encouraged it to actively look at further acquisitions outside Australia.
""You should anticipate some acquisition work in the Northern Hemisphere, but in businesses we already operate in here,"" he said, referring to areas like transport equipment rentals and records managements.
Looking ahead, he said strong contributions from the United States and Europe should continue to offset soft Australian conditions and help produce profit growth.  
""We haven't got an expectation that we will get too much help from this economy ... for at least another six months,"" he said. ""But all in all we've got enough things going to see another (profit) increase for this year,"" he added.
The result generally pleased analysts, who also pointed to the strong U.S. pallet operations as the main bullish note.
""CHEP USA is the outstanding area,"" said Macquarie Equities analyst Ian Myles.
""As long as they're saying positive things about CHEP in the USA then they'll be alright and there's a reasonable amount of momentum there,"" another Sydney transport analyst said.

24,"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp on Thursday reported a lower than expected profit for the first half of 1996/97, but later told analysts it remained confident of a 20 percent profit boost for the full year.
Strong earnings from the hit movie Independence Day and buoyant British newspaper sales helped drive net profits before abnormals 10.3 percent higher to A$731 million (US$561 million).
Abnormal losses of A$41 million cut final first half profits down to A$690 million from A$702 million a year earlier.
But the result was below analyst forecasts of a pre-abnormals profit of A$735 million to A$775 million.
""Everyone's a bit disappointed,"" said a Sydney analyst.
Andrew Sekely, the head of equities at broker Intersuisse, described the result as moderate.
""It certainly wasn't a startingly good result. The market has made its judgement,"" Sekely said. News' shares fell 16 cents to A$6.60 after the result, but closed in Australia at A$6.76.
""It's about A$20 million less than what the market would have liked and to still reach that (20 percent profit growth) outlook, it's got to make up the difference in the second half,"" the Sydney analyst said.
News Corp had said in August last year when it posted a A$1.26 billion net profit for the year to June 30, 1996 that it expected strong movie and television revenues to increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97.
Murdoch repeated the forecast in October, but the group has been publicly tight-lipped about it since then and its first quarter results were also lower than expected.
However, News Corp reassured the analysts in a teleconference briefing after the first half result, saying that it still expected 20 percent profit growth for 1996/97.
""They did say that they're still on track for the 20 percent growth,"" another Sydney media analyst said after the briefing between company officials and U.S. and Australian analysts.
Analysts said News Corp officials were bullish about catching up in the second half and had pointed to a strong outlook for movies and U.S. television and newspapers.
Operating income from News' Fox Filmed Entertainment unit surged to A$202 million for the first half of 1996/97 from A$84 million a year earlier, due largely to Independence Day.
Analysts said the re-release of Star Wars and other films would help further boost movie revenues in the second half.
Sharply lower television profits in the first half because of lower ratings from News' Fox television network and higher programming costs surprised analysts.
But analysts expect a rebound in revenues from Fox television in the second half due to a successful Super Bowl broadcast and the new hit animated comedy King of the Hill.
British newspaper profits rose 18 percent in the first half, with gains in circulation revenues at The Sun, the Times and The Sunday Times, News Corp said.
""All of the company's newspapers have maintained their dominant position in each of their respective markets, despite cover price increases instituted during the quarter at both The Sun and The Times,"" the company said.
Analysts said British newspapers would again perform well in the second half. ""Regardless of what's happening with volumes and prices, which are looking quite good, the relative position on paper prices is improving,"" said First Pacific media analyst Lachlan Drummond.
In contrast, Australian newspapers posted only a slight increase in prodit in the first half reflecting a slow economy.
While News Corp said losses at its burgeoning Asian satellite broadcaster Star TV in the first half were in line with expectations. (A$=US$0.76)

24,"Papua New Guinea's Australian-listed stocks rallied in active trade on Thursday as foreign investors breathed a sigh of relief at the peaceful resolution of the Pacific nation's 10-day political crisis.
Analysts and brokers said investors welcomed Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan's decision late on Wednesday to step aside, which appeared to have calmed an explosive situation and would allow a peaceful transition to a new government.  
""Everyone is relieved that the parliamentary process actually worked and that we didn't go into a period of military control,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett Head of Mining Research David Walker.
""The expectation that the mid-year elections can be brought forward and that there can be an orderly resolution of the impasse has been accepted well,"" Walker said.
Chan stood down on Wednesday under widespread pressure to quit for his hiring of mercenaries to crush an uprising on copper-rich Bougainville island.  
Mining investments group Orogen Minerals Ltd, which is owned 51 percent by the PNG government, closed up eight cents at A$3.10. Oil producer and explorer Oil Search Ltd, which is the largest of the pure Papua New Guinea stocks listed in Australia, closed up 13 cents at A$2.70.
The developer of the one of the world's largest gold deposits at Lihir in PNG, Lihir Gold Ltd, rose two cents to A$2.15. Papua New Guinea retailer and trader, Collins and Leahy Ltd closed up 25 cents at A$3.50 while Bougainville Copper Ltd closed up five cents at 60 cents.  
Papua New Guinea does not have its own stock market, with most large public companies listing on Australia's exchange.
However, analysts said PNG stocks were unlikely to recover all their losses of the past ten days because investors remained somewhat wary of the resource-rich South Pacific nation while the makeup and policies of its new government were undecided.
""It's positive that Chan's (stepped aside) and it should calm the situation up there somewhat,"" said ANZ Securities gold analyst David Kauler.  
""However, it's clear PNG is now in election mode and there's still a period of three to six months of uncertainty ahead ... but it is a cheap time to be buying some of those PNG stocks, particularly Lihir on the gold side,"" Kauler said.
Investor confidence remained bruised by images of street riots and the tense standoff between the army and government.
""It's going to be a difficult, volatile period for investment in the country,"" Kauler said.
""You're going to see a fight between people who see a cheap buying opportunity and other people saying we don't know what the policy is going to be for six months, so let's steer clear.""  
Analysts also said the resolution of the political crisis could bring higher taxes for foreign miners, although any new government was unlikely to restrict entry to resource groups.
ABN AMRO's Walker said the new government would have to look at raising taxes, possibly even the 1.25 percent mining royalty to solve its chronic budget deficits problem.
However, the return to stability in Papua New Guinea at the same time as the controversy over the supposedly huge Busang gold deposit in nearby Indonesia had also created a window of opportunity for extra resource investment, analysts said.  
""PNG, having overcome its immediate problems, has really got to settle down and project an image of stability, because there will be capital funds coming out of Indonesia potentially available for PNG projects,"" Walker said.

24,"Australian television network, The Seven Network Ltd, is expected to report a 25-30 percent higher pre-abnormal annual net profit on Monday, but analysts said this rise was likely to disguise a second half profit slowdown.
""Second half sales growth is going to be quite modest because the Ten Network and Seven lost to Nine,"" said one Sydney analyst.
""And post-Olympics the group hasn't bounced back,"" he said.
Seven had the Australian TV rights to the Atlanta Olympic Games, after it closed its books on June 30.  
The median forecast in BZW Australia's Barceps survey of analysts was for a pre-abnormals net profit for the year to June 30 of A$114 million.
Forecasts range from A$105 million to A$120.7 million and compares with the A$88.5 million posted in 1994/95.
But that 1994/95 figure was cut heavily by a bungle over discounted advertising rates, which cost Seven A$20-30 million and which has been reversed.
A A$114 million net profit would also represent slow growth from the already booked first half profit of A$91.88 million.  
Seven managing director Gary Rice said in April he expected a better second half in 1995/96 than for the discounting-affected second half of 1994/95.
Seven has also said it expected advertising sales in 1995/96 would be six to seven percent higher for the year, after sales growth of 7.5 percent in the first half of 1995/96.
Analysts said ratings losses to the dominant Nine Network, owned by Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, had softened advertising sales. The Ten Network, majority owned by Canada's Canwest, had also been hit by Nine's strength, they said.  
Some said higher costs linked to an expansion of news and current affairs programming may also restrain second half profits.
""Most people will be looking out to see that the move to more news and current affairs will not have caused a blowout in costs,"" said Burdett, Buckridge and Young media analyst Vince Pepe.
""They'll also be looking for Seven's future strategy in relation to news and current affairs, given the existing strategy appears to have floundered in some time slots,"" Pepe said.  
Seven recently cancelled a new 5.00 p.m. national news programme after a short trial because of poor ratings and the recently launched Witness flagship current affairs programme has not been a runaway ratings hit.
Other analysts said Seven may have contained its costs.
""Costs have been pretty well contained in the four to five percent industry range, by dropping costs and laying off people quietly to accommodate the extra news and current affairs push,"" said a Sydney media analyst.
Analysts would also focus on further details about the future of Hollywood film studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  
Seven and Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp agreed in July to pay US$1.3 billion for the studio.
""We'll be looking for any further indications on MGM because when the actual transaction has been completed I believe the business plan there will have changed quite considerably,"" said Pepe.
Seven itself is 15 percent owned by News Corp Ltd and about 20 percent owned by Seven chairman Kerry Stokes.
Seven's shares were down five cents at A$3.80 at 2.15 p.m. (0415 GMT).

24,"Australian Treasurer Peter Costello's construction of a road-block in front of National Australia Bank Ltd's takeover plans has paradoxically made the bank look more attractive, analysts said on Wednesday.
But they said Costello's announcement that he would not allow a big bank merger until parts of the sector became more competitive tarnished the takeover premium built into Westpac Banking Corp's share price in particular.  
Investors who had expected National Australia Bank (NAB) to be given the green light to go on the big bank merger warpath pushed NAB's share price 2.5 percent higher, happy for now it will not have to make a big share issue to finance a takeover.
""The price movement in NAB is a reflection in the short term that the market sees it as a positive NAB won't be an acquirer because of the potential dilution of a share issue to fund such a takeover,"" said one senior Sydney bank analyst.
""NAB was underpriced and to the extent that a big rights isuse was hanging over the market, it makes sense for it to kick up a bit,"" said Macquarie Equities analyst Graham Maloney.  
NAB closed up 39 cents at A$16.11 after Treasurer Costello ended the ""Six Pillars"" policy banning mergers between the four major banks and two major life groups, but said the four majors would have to wait for stronger competition before merging.
Westpac Banking Corp, seen as the most vulnerable to takeover, closed down 20 cents at A$6.67, while ANZ Banking Group Ltd closed down 11 cents at A$7.89.
""There was a margin of acquisition premium there, particularly in Westpac. Now that it appears that there's unlikely to be an acquisition, it makes sense to mark it back,"" Maloney said.  
Analysts said however that Costello's comments about ending the current blanket ban on foreign takeovers of the major banks could offset some of the sector's disappointment.
""The equity markets are a little bit disappointed that the 'four pillars' effectively remain, but at the end of the day there is a potential for foreign takeover,"" said J.B. Were, head or research at Craig Drummond, adding that Westpac and ANZ were not expensive banks by global standards.
""The only risk is that there are major foreign holders that bought into both of those banks in the expectation that there could be a major bank merger,"" Drummond said.  
""Some traders could still cause Westpac and ANZ to be weak in the short term.""
Brokers said NAB's share price appeared also to benefit from the potential for a takeover bid by a foreign group.
""(The Wallis report) hasn't ruled out the possibility of allowing a foreign bank to take over any of our banks -- it seems to strengthen NAB's position and also the Commonwealth's (Bank of Australia ) position,"" said Kevin Lourey, a dealer at Melbourne broker, Peake Lands Kirwan.
CBA's shares rose 28 cents to A$12.98.  
Longer term, analysts said the Wallis Inquiry's recommendations on freeing up access to the banking sector and allowing non-banks access to the payments system would sharpen competition and eventually put profit margins under pressure.
""Opening access to the payments system, I see that as critical,"" said Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson.
""The capacity of someone like a GE Capital to have access to the payments system is a fairly important increase in competition,"" he said.

24,"Local billionaire Kerry Packer faces an uphill battle to overcome political opposition and a high asking price if he wants to take over Australia's oldest publisher, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
Speculation has simmered for months that Australia's biggest television station owner will launch a takeover bid for Fairfax as soon as the government eased cross-media rules set up by the former Labor government.
Comments by Prime Minister John Howard last week that Fairfax needed an owner like Packer fanned that speculation into talk of an imminent easing of the rules and an inevitably successful takeover bid.
Analysts said on Tuesday however that a successful Packer bid for Fairfax, which publishes three of Australia's most profitable daily newspapers, was not such a sure thing.
Growing political opposition from within Howard's conservative Liberal-National coalition and a hostile Senate have made any Howard plan look more fragile.
""There's a few more hurdles to overcome yet,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett senior media analyst Vince Pepe.
""Getting (Prime Minister John) Howard to introduce legislation is one thing, but getting it through parliament while keeping his backbench appeased is another thing,"" Pepe said.
""The amount of political fallout that's beginning might see him wondering whether it is such a clever thing after all.""
Howard's cabinet was considering on Tuesday changes to the cross-media rules that stop television station owners like Packer from buying a major newspaper group like Fairfax.
Howard has already said the rules are outdated and his government is widely expected to drop them, allowing Packer to use his current 15 percent stake as a beachhead for a full scrip-based takeover bid.
But Howard's position has come under increasing fire in recent days after Seven Network Ltd Chairman Kerry Stokes accused Howard of having done what he called a disgraceful deal with Packer that would concetrate media ownership into the hands of just two men.
A successful Packer takeover of Fairfax would mean Australia's major newspapers would be divided between Packer and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.
A controversial independent senator, Mal Colston, threw up another roadblock in front of any media law changes earlier on Tuesday, threatening to vote against the government.
The fine balance in the Senate means if Colston votes against the government, the balance of power transfers to the left-leaning Democrat and Green senators, who have said they oppose any further concentration of media ownership.
Analysts also said Packer may baulk at having to pay the A$3.0 billion (US$2.35 billion) needed to convince some large entrenched shareholders to bail out Fairfax.
Packer may also struggle to convince his fellow shareholders in the bid vehicle, Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, to swallow the earnings dilution such a bid would create.
""Despite Packer's apparent obsession for Fairfax, he's not going to pay a stupid price for it and some people in the market are expecting a stupid price,"" said another analyst.
""I'd be a pretty disappointed PBL shareholder if he was prepared to pay more than A$3.40 (a share) for it,"" the analyst said, adding that a A$3.40 price would be earnings dilutive given Fairfax's forecast earnings. Fairfax's shares closed down two cents at A$3.23 on Tuesday.

24,"Rupert Murdoch on Tuesday reported that News Corp Ltd had performed below expectations in the first quarter, but he said the global media group was still on track for a 20-percent profit rise this year.
Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corp, also unveiled a more conservative approach to financing new acquisitions.
""I am on record as saying that we expect a 20-percent increase in profit for the year,"" Murdoch told a packed News Corp annual meeting in Adelaide.
""We still expect that and are still aiming for that during the coming year. However, I should say that the first quarter may not be quite up to those expectatations, but we will certainly be striving to make up any shortfall,"" Murdoch said.
Analysts viewed the comments as disappointing and said they were now more sceptical about the 20-percent profit pledge.
""If they can't meet expectations in the first quarter, when they have those strong revenues from Independence Day, then what hope do they have of getting 20 percent in the full year?"" asked one Sydney-based media analyst referring to a hit Hollywood movie made by News Corp's Fox studio.
Traders on the Australian share market did not like the first quarter comment either, selling the shares 14 cents or almost two percent lower to close at A$7.20, while the broader Australian equity market closed at a new record high.
In the 1995/96 year ended June 30, News Corp's net profit slipped to A$1.02 billion ($806 million) from A$1.37 billion in 1994/95.
Murdoch said revenues at the Fox U.S. television business had begun 1996/97 slowly because of of the Atlanta Olympic Games, the rights to which were held by a rival network.
Australian newspaper revenues would be flat in 1996/97, said Murdoch.
But he remained buoyant about News' British operations, saying the advertising market there was booming and the partly-owned BSkyB pay television operators was growing strongly.
Murdoch then unveiled a more cautious strategy for financing future expansion.
""As far as possible, we will finance them (News' expansion plans) out of current cash flow to maintain liquidity so that we will be ready to take new opportunities as they arise,"" he said.
News has often funded its aggressive growth in pay television and other media through either hefty debt or equity issues, which have sometimes met shareholder resistance. It almost collapsed under a debt mountain in the early 1990s.
Analysts said the comments indicated a more conservative approach towards acquisitions and their financing and would be welcomed by the market.
""It imposes a huge financial discipline on the company which would hearten people immensely,"" said another analyst.
Murdoch also announced that News planned to float its British-based digital media technology company, Digital Media Services, within the next two to three weeks and would sell 20 percent of the company.
Digital Media Services, a combination of News Data Comm and Digi-Media Vision Ltd, would operate in Britain and Israel and produce technology for digital television.
News Corp traditionally holds its annual meetings here in Adelaide, the South Australia city where Rupert Murdoch's father Keith founded the beginnings of the News Corp empire.

24,"Water filtration company Memtec Ltd is confident the failure of its planned US$280 million takeover bid for U.S. medical filtration company Gelman Sciences Inc will not affect earnings or its U.S. expansion plans.
Memtec chairman Denis Hanley told Reuters in a telephone interview from the United States that a compensation clause in the original takeover deal negotiated with Gelman meant it would not affect Memtec's earnings in the year to June 30, 1997.  
""There were clauses in the contract that compensated us for our effort,"" Hanley said.
""It will have no impact on our normal earnings,"" he said.
In July, Gelman said it had agreed to be taken over by the NASDAQ-listed Memtec, which offered 1.05 Memtec American Depositary Receipts (ADRS) for each Gelman share.
The offer than valued each Gelman share at about US$35 a share, but Memtec's share price fell after the July announcement and the agreement included a clause allowing Gelman to renegotiate or terminate the deal if Memtec's share price fell below US$30.  
On Monday, Gelman agreed to a takeover bid by fellow filtration company Pall Corp, which valued Gelman's shares at US$33 per share and effectively trumped Memtec's bid.
Memtec then said on Tuesday it would not increase its bid and that the original merger agreement had been terminated.
Hanley said he and Memtec's management had spent months preparing for the Gelman takeover and organising a roadshow promoting the bid, but that Memtec had been compensated for the costs involved.
He said Memtec's likely growth in the United States this year would not be affected by failure of the deal.  
""This year the growth we'll probably see will still be better than 50 percent without this deal,"" he said.
Memtec remained on the lookout for expansion opportunities in the United States, particularly in the medical filtration sector.
""We see many ways of getting into the medical market there,"" he said, adding however that he could not be specific about how Memtec would increase its presence.
Gelman makes microfiltration products for laboratories, healthcare, environmental monitoring, high-technology process industries and other uses.  
The end of the Gelman deal has pleased shareholders however, with Memtec's shares jumping A$3.50 to A$41.50 by Wednesday's close from its A$35 level on Monday.
Memtec had been around A$42.50 in mid-July.

24,"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is likely to benefit from the planned US$20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc, Australian media analysts said on Monday.
News Corp, which already has a wide-ranging partnership with MCI, would strengthen its global media interests on the coat-tails of the creation of the world's second largest telecommunications group, the analysts said.
""It means they'll be in bed with a bigger, more powerful global telephony group,"" one senior Sydney media analyst said.
Analysts also said the BT-MCI merger would stabilise New Corp's partnership with MCI, which had seemed increasingly strained in recent months.
""It seems that MCI and News haven't been getting on lately, whereas News and BT have been getting on a lot better,"" said the Sydney analyst.
The prospect of MCI selling its nine percent stake in News Corp over the next year had suppressed News Corp's shares last month.
""There was a view that MCI wasn't real happy with it (the partnership) and may sell out, but now nothing's going to happen for 12 months at least,"" said another Sydney analyst.
""The implications for News are quite positive.""
A Melbourne analyst said some in the market were a bit worried that MCI was preparing to sell down its stake over the next 12 months. ""The fact that BT may combine with MCI reduces that risk for now at least,"" one analyst said.
MCI and News Corp announced a broad alliance in May 1995, under which MCI bought a nine percent stake in News for US$1.35 billion and acquired an option to increase that stake to 13.5 percent. They agreed, among other things, to jointly set up an American satellite television operation -- ASkyB.
But progress with ASkyB has been slow and other smaller joint ventures have failed to fire. Australian analysts said they would remain cautious towards ASkyB, given bearish comments on Sunday by MCI. MCI announced that it would cut its stake in ASkyB to 20 percent from 50 percent.
Analysts said this was not surprising as News Corp and MCI had said recently they wanted new partners in the venture.
MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts told Reuters on Sunday that no major new launches were expected from the venture with News Corp and that MCI wanted to sell a US$700 million satellite license to News.
He also said MCI was unlikely to take up its option to increase its stake in News, a comment seen by analysts as symptomatic of Roberts' increasing unhappiness with the deal.
Analysts also warned there was a potential regulatory block to links between News, its 40 percent owned BSkyB Plc, and BT.
""There's an outside risk that British regulatory bodies could try and block the News-BSkyB-BT side of it,"" said a BT analyst.
Other analysts said the dilution involved, with BT owning nine percent of a 40 percent stake in BSkyB, would assuage regulatory concerns. The likely election of a British Labour government also reduced that risk.
""They're banking on (Labour leader) Tony Blair winning government and deregulating cross media rules in the United Kingdom,"" said another Sydney analyst.
However, another analyst pointed to the recent banning by British regulator Oftel of a joint marketing campaign between BT and BSkyB as a sign of the rocky road ahead for News and BT.

25,"Germany and the Czech Republic on Friday concluded nearly two years of sensitive talks on a joint declaration aimed at finally healing the wounds of World War Two and the communist era that followed.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec signed a protocol which sends forward a text expressing regret for injustices on both sides, and setting up a fund for joint projects.
The declaration expresses Bonn's sorrow for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague's regret for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans.
It marks Germany's final reconciliation with neighbours who fell under Nazi occupation.
""We Germans regret the suffering and injustice caused to the Czech people by National-Socialist (Nazi) crimes, and we are recognising our responsibility,"" Kinkel told diplomats and journalists after signing the protocol.
The text was approved by both governments earlier this week, and is to be signed by prime ministers in January, but politicians on both sides of the border are calling for changes before parliaments and presidents give it their final approval.
Both Kinkel and Zielenec insisted the text would not be reopened for negotiation.
Czech opponents of the text claim it fails to pay direct compensation to victims of Nazi agression, while German groups are furious that it avoids paying restitution for Prague's expropriation of property of the so-called Sudeten Germans.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.
The text says the fund is to finance ""projects of common interest"" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific ones, adding that ""the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of victims of (Nazi) violence.""
""The declaration which we have agreed on means simply a clarification of understanding,"" Zieleniec said.
""This declaration is not a full stop after history. It only closes one sentence and one paragraph. It also is a semi-colon and starts a discussion on the topic of joint projects focused on the future,"" he added.
The main political critic in Germany is the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU) which acts as mentor to the Sudeten Germans, survivors and relatives of the 2.5 million ethnic Germans who were collectively blamed for the Nazi occupation and summarily driven out.
Leaders of Bavaria, where most Sudetens settled, had demanded changes in the text, but the Czech government has insisted it will negotiate only with Bonn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is due to sign the declaration with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in January and the presidents of the two countries will then address each other's parliaments to seal the matter.
A major German daily newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, on Friday called the declaration a political sham.
""Perhaps one day there will be a German-Czech declaration which in its honesty and sincerity does provide a historic sign of reconciliation,"" the daily said in a commentary.
""The great majority of the Czech nation, above all the great majority of politicians, is convinced that the Czechoslovak state was not only politically clever but also morally and legally in the right when it got rid of the German minority."" ($1=1.5570 Mark)

25,"The Czech coalition government on Wednesday looked to recover from the resignation of Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, a deputy premier who joined four other politicians in admitting they used phoney academic titles.
A cabinet aide said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and key members of the tenous three-party coalition government were waiting for Kalvoda's party to meet later on Wednesday before serious talks on his replacement can begin.
Kalvoda, leader of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) a junior coalition partner, resigned his cabinet and parliament seat on Tuesday, in a speech which caught everybody off guard.
He rose to tell the house that he ""wasn't happy to be the next episode of a soap opera, but the title Juris Doctor does not belong to me"". Then he quit.
Kalvoda joined four more members of parliament who have admitted to using ""Doctor of Law"" falsely, as accusations spilled on to the floor of the chamber in a country where academic titles are more often used than first names.
Leaders of ODA, a party with four seats in the 16-member government, were to meet on Wednesday evening to consider who to nominate in Kalvoda's place, a decision which rests with the party according to the agreement which set up the cabinet.
They are expected to discuss whether Kalvoda will remain as head of the strongly pro-business ODA, which he helped establish ahead of general elections in 1992.
A member of parliament from the coalition partner Christian Democrats, resigned for the same reason on Tuesday.
But two members of Klaus's senior Civic Democratic Party, and a member of the opposition Social Democrats have said they will not step down after similar confessions.
Political analysts said that Kalvoda's confession was damaging, but Klaus's tenous government -- which lost its parliamentary majority in June elections -- can survive in tact if the ODA can agree on who can lead the party in the cabinet.
However, two factions within the ODA -- one associated with Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, and anothter with minister at large Pavel Bratinka -- are likely to fight for control of the party.
""If they (ODA) does not have a good candidate quickly, the government could do some reshuffling,"" Jiri Pehe, director of research at Prague Open Media Research Institute, told Reuters.
The danger to the government's stability would be if the coalition agreement, pounded out after a month of tense negotiations following the June elections, is reopened.
Klaus told journalists that Kalvoda's resignation was ""a political swerve, it's disquieting and unsettling"" but that the government would aim to take it in stride.
The foreign exchange market, wary of any instability within the tenous centre-right cabinet reacted sharply and the crown was volatile throughout morning trading.
The usually stable currency fell 50 basis points against the Czech National Bank's mark/dollar basket before recovering when the central bank fixed the crown at 2.32 percent above parity with the basket, down from +2.75 percent on Tuesday.
By mid-day it had recovered to +2.50 above the basket.
Kamil Janacek, chief economist at the largest Czech Bank Komercni Banka, said he did not think Kalvoda's resignation would damage the government.
""The stability of the government does not depend on Mr. Kalvoda. What happened has nothing to do with the ministry itself, it's a personal thing for Mr. Kalvoda,"" Janacek said.
Pehe said that more phoney-title confessions might still add to the growing drama in parliament.
""In this society it plays such a role -- whether or not you have (an advanced) degree -- I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not,"" he said.

25,"Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec on Monday said his country viewed as frivolous and ""absolutely unacceptable"" Russian hints of economic reprisals for Prague's entry into NATO.
""We consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance with bilateral (Czech-Russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context,"" the Czech news agency CTK quoted Zieleniec as saying.
Moscow's ambassador to Prague, Nikolai Ryabov, warned the Czech Republic on Sunday that key bilateral agreements with Russia might be jeopardised if it joined NATO.
Ryabov told Russia's NTV commercial television that the former Warsaw Pact member's entry into the Western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for Moscow.
The ambassador went on to hint that Moscow could reconsider economic deals with Prague if it went ahead.
""Agreements fundamental to the Czech Republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face,"" he said.
Zieleniec told CTK that Ryabov's statement made it clear why the Czechs wanted to join Western organisations.
""This type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important...at the earliest, to become a member of the key Western political, economic, and security organisations,"" Zieleniec said.
He said he thought the ambassador's interview on Russian television was mostly for media consumption.
The Czechs, Poland and Hungary are expected to be named among the first former-Soviet Bloc countries to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid.
After the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total Czech trade turnover with Russia grew 9.8 percent in 1996 to $2.8 billion.
But it was heavily weighted in Russia's favour with Czech exports to Russia at $694 million while imports from Russia were $2.1 billion.
Czechs are still dependent on Russia for natural gas and most of their crude oil, but Prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long-term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from Norway.
Last year, the Czechs opened the Ingolstadt spur in the Transalpine crude pipeline from the Adriatic Sea, providing direct access to crude from the Middle East.
The Czech power company CEZ a.s. is also dependent on Russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at Dukovany. But the company is expected to take U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at Temelin by the end of the century.
The Czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly Soviet-era equipment with Western-made, NATO-compatible goods.

25,"Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) on Tuesday gave investment grade ratings to three of the four largest Czech banks, but said the high marks were partly due to an implied safety net for the banks provided by the state.
In its first quality debt ratings for commercial banks in former communist Europe, S&amp;P gave long-term ratings of BBB-minus to Komercni Banka a.s., Ceska Sporitelna a.s. , and  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s..
It also issued all three banks short-term ratings of A3 for counterparty risk in trade with other banks.
The ratings fell short of the Czech Republic's sovereign rating of A, but were similar to the marks issued to the Slovak, Polish, and Greek central banks, and one grade above Hungarian sovereign debt.
But in explaining the ratings, S&amp;P said the three banks' size and position in the market made it ""highly likely that the Czech government would provide support"" if needed.
Thus, the ratings were higher than they would have been if based solely on each bank's financial situation.
S&amp;P did not give a rating for the third largest Czech bank, IPB a.s., which is waiting for a roughly one-third stake to be privatised in a tender later this spring.
S&amp;P said Komercni had 25 percent of Czech deposits, 26 percent of the credit market and conducted 10 percent of total trading on the Prague Stock Exchange last year.
""Given the bank's size, its importance to the country's financial system, and position in the market, S&amp;P believes state support would be forthcoming if required in the future, although no formal guarantee exists,"" it said of Komercni, the country's largest commercial bank.
It said that Komercni's classified loans totalled 35.4 percent at the end of September and its outlook was stable.
Komercni's deputy general director Borivoj Prazak told reporters after the announcement that the bank was ""very glad"" to receive the ratings. ""We held our ground,"" despite slower than expected Czech macroeconomic growth, he said.
As with the other two banks, the Czech government has a major stake in Komcerni, 48.7 percent.
The government has said it plans to privatise all state-held banks, so getting the ratings based on the tacit state safety net adds more intrigue to the debate over the speed and extent of Czech banking privatisation.
S&amp;P noted that Sporitelna, the former Communist savings bank where virtually all deposits were kept, was still ""the most important player in Czech retail banking"" but said it ""remains vulnerable to further problems within the sector"".
""(Sporitelna's) asset quality problems remain a concern with customer loans classified as non-standard amounting to 43.6 billion crowns ($1.58 billion), representing 31.8 percent of gross customer loans at year-end 1995,"" S&amp;P said.
It said that CSOB's ratings reflected the bank's strong position in foreign trade financing and its joint ownership by the Czech and Slovak governments.
The S&amp;P report said CSOB's non-standard loan level had dropped to 41 percent of gross customer loans by the end of 1995 from 51 percent at the end of the previous year.

25,"Tremours rumbled through Czech markets on Monday, as crown, debt, and equity traders were anxious about the contents of a government pro-growth package due out mid-week.
The extent of budget cuts and measures affecting interest and exchange rates in the still-secret package -- aimed at stemming growing budget and trade deficits and reviving economic growth -- kept everybody in the markets guessing.
The Czech crown fell to a 10-month low, losing 1.5 percent of its value trading late on Monday at 30.283/dollar 17.568/mark or about 0.75 percent below parity with the peg, from 29.290 and 17.439, or +0.80 on Friday.
""I think we'll see much nervousness on the markets (until the cabinet's announcement) -- forex, equity, and fixed income,"" said Vladimir Kreidl at Prague's Patria Finance.
In thin activity on the Prague Stock Exchange, the blue-chip PX50 index dropped about 0.5 percent to 548.5.
""Probably now, the nervousness around the government measures is a little bit distracting,"" said Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings. The heaviest decliner among top shares was Komercni Banka, which fell 65 crowns, 2.8 percent, to 2,247.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and other senior ministers have suggested a series of budget cuts along with a loosening in monetary policy, but specific details have not been revealed.
The central bank responded last Thursday by easing minimum reserve requirements, but kept key interest rates unchanged.
The Czech National Bank fixed the crown on Monday at 30.045 and 17.439 or +0.04 percent above parity, as rates fluctuated wildly ahead of the daily fixing at 11.30 am (0930 gmt).
The sharp fall in the crown did not give a reason for the CNB to intervene to prop up its value, the CTK news agency quoted CNB spokesman Martin Svehla as saying late on Monday. Central bank officials were not available for further comment.
Traders are debating whether the central bank, as a complicit part of the plan to be announced on Wednesday, would let the crown depreciate to help a worsening trade situation.
The crown, which hit its high in February against the central bank's mark/dollar peg, has been especially sensitive as government pressure for an easing of monetary policy grows.
""Traders see the authorities as not opposing a weaker Czech crown, and the authorities are seeing the revaluation (side of the central bank's fixing) band, as overvalued,"" said Petr Korous, a trader at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.
Korous said comments by Prime Minister Klaus over the weekend, hinting he was not happy with the crown's higher exchange rate levels, added more uncertainty.
The government and the central bank have repeatedly ruled out a direct administrative devaluation of the crown in order to boost exports, although the country's current account deficit now is over eight percent of gross domestic product.
""I haven't seen the market this agitated since last September. When you see volatility like that, and it's across the board not just a few major players, that can be a bit of a problem,"" said one London-based analyst.

25,"Czech President Vaclav Havel has been moved out of intensive care three weeks after surgery to remove a malignant tumour from his lung, but he will have to spend Christmas in hospital, doctors said on Monday.
""Mr. President has ended his stay in the intensive care unit and has been moved to a standard-care room,"" the head of Havel's medical team, Dr. Pavel Pafko, told a news conference.
He said that there were no further complications and the 60-year-old Havel's health was improving, but doctors felt his recuperation would be handled better in hospital.
It was not yet clear how long it would be before Havel could go home.
Havel, who had been fighting complications from the surgery which removed half of his right lung, was taken off a respirator which had been installed through his throat late last week. He has been able to speak occasionally.
His team of doctors have said that the cancer was caught at an early stage, and that there was no sign of the disease spreading to other tissue.
Pneumonia developed in the other lung after the surgery and caused a high fever, but both the pneumonia and the fever have subsided.
Havel, the chain-smoking dissident playwright who helped lead Prague's 1989 bloodless revolution which overthrew communism, entered hospital on November 25, after his office said he had been fighting a case of pneumonia.
Presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek said Havel would write his traditional New Year's address, but it would be shorter than speeches given in the past.
He said it would be determined next week whether or not Havel himself would give the speech.
Havel's New Year speeches usually take stock of the moral state of Czech society and the development of democracy in the country.
The president, a widower after his wife Olga died of cancer last January, has received get-well wishes from heads of state around the world, and thousands of letter from Czechs.
Spacek has publicly thanked Havel's companion, the Czech actress Dagmar Veskernova, for her support in helping the president through his recovery.
Havel, whose position is more ceremonial than executive, has relinquished none of his constitutional powers.

25,"Czechs, with a relatively large number of Oscar-winning films and filmmakers for a small nation, on Tuesday praised Jan and Zdenek Sverak for bringing home a coveted Academy Award for their film ""Kolya"".
The story of an ageing bachelor's re-awakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 Velvet Revolution won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in the ceremony held late on Monday.
President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident playwright under communism who acted in a few films himself, sent a victory telegram to the family Sverak in Los Angeles.
""I am pleased with the great success of your film. I am happy that after many years a Czech film has again received the Oscar,"" Havel's press office quoted the telegram as saying.
Local newscasts headlined the Kolya win for the director Jan, 31, and his scriptwriter father Zdenek, who played the greybeard bachelor in Kolya.
""The Oscar Goes to Prague"" heralded the capital city's daily Vecernik Praha.
It was the first Czech foreign language film Oscar since Jiri Menzel's ""Closely Observed Trains"" won in 1968 amid the period known worldwide as the ""Czech New Wave"".
Slovak Elmar Klos won the best foreign film Oscar in 1966 for ""The Shop on Main Street"" when Czechoslovakia was still ruled as one state.
This country of 10 million people also lays claim to director Milos Forman, a Prague native who made the Oscar-winning ""Amadeus"" (1985) and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1976) after emigrating to the United States.
Forman failed to pick up best director honours on Monday after his nomination for ""The People Versus Larry Flint"", after winning a Golden Globe and the Berlin's Golden Bear for the film.
The Sverak team made their first international splash in 1992, when the post-war drama-comedy ""Elementary School"" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost.
Zdenek is currently working on the team's first original English-language script.
Critics say Kolya, a politically-charged comedy/drama which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech New Wave.
""The film is about how the understanding between nations is much more important than the power,"" Sverak told reporters backstage after winning the Oscar.
Earlier this month Kolya won the Czech version of the Oscar, the Czech Lev (Lion), for best picture, but Zdenek Sverak was edged out for the best Czech actor award by Bolek Polivka, a popular cabaret comedian.
Kolya was favoured to take home the Oscar after winning Hollywood's Golden Globe for best foreign language film in January.

25,"The Czech crown firmed from the central bank fixing on Thursday, building on gains after a strong showing of the senior coalition party in Senate elections last weekend and prospects for the second round vote.
Analysts said Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's pro-business Civic Democratic Party (ODS) was expected to take a majority of the 81 seats in the newly-created Senate after runoff elections this weekend should keep the crown firm.
The crown was trading mid-afternoon on Thursday at 26.661 to the dollar and 17.757 to the mark, or 3.05 percent above the Czech National Bank's dollar/mark basket.
""Mostly the expectations are that the ODS will win a majority in the Senate which I think is fairly likely,"" Citibank economist Radek Maly said.
The ODS already won three seats outright last Saturday and has 76 candidates through to the runoff this Friday and Saturday in the 77 constituencies remaining to be contested.
The crown, despite a ballooning trade deficit, has remained above well above parity with the basket, and has this week strengthened from last Friday's level of +2.45 percent.
Maly said he saw the currency staying close to Thursday's levels, and possibly getting a further bump up on Monday.
""I would personally see this level until the vote... Perhaps Monday we will see a similar situation, a quick strengthening, a quick speculative reaction,"" he said.
Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskovslovenska Obchodni Banka, said that despite voter turnout of only 35 percent in the first round of the elections, the market was still firming on the ODS showing.
""There will be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown,"" he said. ""More or less the basic impulse for that is really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets.""
The Senate has limited political power, but the vote would at least confirm that ODS had not suffered a further loss of confidence after the coaltion saw its majority in the more-powerful lower house evaporate in June general elections.
This week the Prague Stock Exchange has shown its first signs of life since the summer. 
Meanwhile fixed income and crown deposit investors are getting more confident that Klaus's tight fiscal and monetary policies will not be threatened.
""Those who want to play the interest rate differential (with foreign currencies) feel quite comfortable right now,"" Korous said.

25,"The Czech crown firmed on Thursday to its highest level against its mark/dollar basket, buoyed by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus' comments that devaluation was not needed despite a widening trade gap.
By mid-morning the crown moved to around 4.3 percent above its daily parity rate set by the Czech National Bank (CNB) against the dollar/mark basket from a four percent level in the morning.
The crown stood at 26.005 to the dollar and 17.600 to the mark at 1130 GMT.
The CNB followed the market up, fixing the crown 4.24 percent above parity with the basket after +3.9 percent on Wednesday.
Dealers said the crown could challenge 4.5 percent against parity before levelling off to end the week.
""Probably we will attack 4.5 percent (over parity),"" Tomas Becvar, dealer at Prague's Komercni Banka, told Reuters.
Although the Czech trade balance earlier this week showed a record monthly deficit in July of 16.4 billion crowns, the market was encouraged by Klaus's comments.
""The first (reason for the crown's rise) is Klaus's comments in Austria,"" Becvar said. ""Another reason of course is the following of the market by the central bank at the fixing.""
At an economic conference in Austria, Klaus backed the CNB's Governor Josef Tosovsky view that a stronger crown would be better for the economy in the long-term.
""We think that a devaluation is not necessary and that it wouldn't be useful,"" Klaus told Reuters.
While some economists have recommended devaluing the crown to help the trade situation, many said it is not fundamentally necessary as capital inflows remain strong and the balance of services, especially toursim, softens the current account gap.
The Czech currency last dipped below the parity rate against the basket in mid-June, soon after elections stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority in parliament and strenghthend the hand of the opposition Social Democrats.
But since then, the Czech currency has been on a steady march up, first hovering around three percent against the basket, then surging after Tosovsky's comments last Friday.
Klaus was finally able to form a minority government of his centre-right coalition while the centre-left Social Democrats have been concilliatory on economic issues, including a 9.3 billion crown cut in spending to balance this year's budget.
Dealers said positive preliminary results on Thursday for July's industrial production, showing a moderate recovery from disappointing June figures, also helped the crown.

25,"Czech politicians are struggling to overcome scepticism about the merits of NATO membership, with opinion polls consistently showing Czechs the coolest of the central European frontrunners towards joining the bloc.
While surveys show a majority of Hungarians and Poles in favour of joining the alliance, they say less than 40 percent of Czech citizens back NATO membership.
""Many consider NATO to be just military manoeuvres around Europe, and maybe it is our fault that we haven't been able to explain the importance in the solidarity of values,"" Czech Senate Chairman Petr Pithart told Reuters in an interview.
But Pithart, elected to chair the new upper house of parliament in December, also believes there is a lingering lack of respect for the army which would make a referendum on NATO membership, sought by the political opposition, irrelevant.
""The relationship to NATO, the less strong will here compared with Poland or Hungary or wherever, is evidently for me more a result of the scepticism against the army of the Czech republic than against NATO,"" Pithart said on Thursday.
The Czechs, along with Poland and Hungary, are widely expected to be invited to join NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) at a summit of member states in July.
NATO membership has been the top foreign policy aspiration of the Czech government, along with joining the European Union.
Disdain for the Czech army built up after World War Two and during 40 years of communism, when many Czechs saw the military as subservient to Moscow.
Opinion polls also show that many people are simply tired of being tied to a military bloc.
Pithart, who was the Czech Republic's first post-Communist prime minister and is now affiliated to the centre-right Christian Democrats, is joined in his opposition to a referendum on NATO by the conservative current Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
But the chairman of the lower house, Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman, has joined ultra-right and Communist members of parliament in calling for a referendum, although he says he and his opposition party are in favour of joining NATO.
""Certainly to be against holding a referendum is dangerous because it indicates you feel a majority of people are against (NATO membership),"" said Pithart, a political scientist and leading dissident under Communism.
""But to use (a referendum), which we've never used in the political tradition of this country, is absurd.""
Pithart said Czech politicians must start rebuilding the prestige of the military by pointing out the army's solid performance with NATO in the IFOR and SFOR missions in Bosnia.
""Because in our modern history one of the major casualties is that the army has somewhat lost prestige and...respect,"" Pithart said.
Echoing a favourite theme of his friend, President Vaclav Havel, Pithart said it was necessary to also stress the non-military underpinnings of NATO representing a family of democratic nations in Europe.

4,"While General Motors Corp. struggles to overcome labour costs of $43 an hour at its parts plants, the head of one global auto supplier is painting a Darwinian view of the future, in which an increasing number of workers earn less than $10 an hour.
Nearly one-quarter of ITT Automotive Inc.'s workers around the world will be paid a combined hourly wage and benefit rate of less than $10 by 2000, the company's top executive said this week at a conference of suppliers.
That sobering forecast spotlights a long-term problem for GM, which is now in the throes of negotiating a new three-year labour contract with the United Auto Workers union.
""They can't make a buck stamping out taillights and paying people $43 an hour,"" said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.
Adds Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi: ""Their 43 other competitors aren't going to say 'We'll spot you a couple of years.'""
Timothy Leuliette, president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive, said the company paid 15 percent of its 35,000 workers around the world less than $10 an hour in 1995. That was up from 10 percent of its employees at that pay level in 1990.
""Do we do that because we're mean?"" Leuliette said of the falling wage rates. ""No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3 to 4 percent price reduction.""
Facing union demands for greater job security, GM must find a way for its massive Delphi Automotive Systems parts business to stay competitive in the worldwide auto supplier market.
In the current talks, Delphi has said 12 of its U.S. component facilities are underperforming and should not be subject to the job guarantees the UAW has received from other automakers.
Even if it accepts the economic terms already agreed to by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. , GM and Delphi will pay the average U.S. parts worker a base wage of nearly $19 an hour in the first year of the contract, and more than $21 in 1999, the third year of the agreement.
About 42 percent of Delphi's workers are located in the United States, where the combined hourly wage and benefit cost of a UAW worker under the 1993 national agreement is about $43.
Delphi, with 1995 revenues of $26.4 billion, is in 167 businesses around the world. Global expansion remains a focus for the company, which this year expects 35 percent of its revenues to come from customers outside of GM's North American Operations, Delphi President J.T. Battenberg said Tuesday.
But as Leuliette's comments indicate, the global auto supplier industry is growing increasingly competitive.
The worldwide hourly wage rate for assembling a labour-intensive part such as a wire harness is between $1 and $2, he estimated. More technical parts cost $10-$12 an hour.
Leuliette said workers in Vietnam will earn $64 a month working 48 hours a week putting together wiring harnesses for ITT.
""If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,"" Leuliette told the gathering of suppliers in Detroit.
ITT Automotive, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is the biggest unit within ITT Industries Inc., and one of the largest independent auto suppliers in the world.
The company, which has annual sales of about $5.5 billion, makes brake and chassis systems, as well as body and electrical components such as motors, actuators and wiper systems. Leuliette estimated the company's average global total wage costs at about $14 an hour.

4,"After 19 months of sometimes violent confrontations, six striking newspaper unions on Friday made an unconditional offer to return to work at Detroit's two major daily papers.
Al Derey, head of the Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions, said the action was not an act of surrender but a tactic to expose the papers to potentially huge financial losses if they do not agree to a fair contract.
""Our position is this strike has not ended. This is simply a new strategy to try to win a fair and decent contract from two corporate giants that don't have any souls,"" a visibly emotional Derey told a news conference.
About 2,500 distribution, pressroom, newsroom and mailroom workers walked off their jobs at the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News in July 1995 after contract talks collapsed.
The papers are editorially indepdendent and have separate owners but have been published under a joint operating agreement since 1989.
Knight-Ridder Inc. owns the Free Press. The News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc.
A representative from Detroit Newspapers Inc, the joint operating agency, could not be reached for comment.
The papers have published every day since the strike began, although early on they only published a single joint edition. More than 400 of the original strikers have cross picket lines. The papers have hired about 1,400 replacements.
Since the start of the strike, which has often erupted in violent confrontations between supporters and private security guards, circulation at the papers has fallen 30 percent. Advertising revenues are down between 15 percent and 20 percent.
Derey told reporters the advertising boycott has cost the papers a combined $250 million, and 700,000 readers have dropped subscriptions. But because the newspapers ""still don't get it,"" he said the unions need to adopt a new strategy.
If the papers reject the return-to-work offer, they could be liable for back pay from the time the offer was made if they were found to have commited unfair labor practices, said Derey. That amounts to $250,000 a day, or $1 million a year, he said.
The action Friday is a controversial one for many union members, who are staunchly opposed to returning to work. But Derey appealed for their support.
""This wasn't the only strategy and it isn't the easiest, but it is the best way we've got to take on these corporate powers and get us moving again down the road to a fair contract,"" he said.
One local labor analyst said the union's move was an acknowledgement the strike as a means of leverage has reached the point of diminishing returns. But it does force management to make some difficult decisions.
""What the unions are doing now is upping the legal ante,"" said Steve Babson, labor program specialist at Wayne State University's Labor Studies Center.
If the papers do not agree to take back all of the striking workers, they could be liable for the back pay penalities if they commited unfair labor practices, a legal process that could take years to resolve, he said.
The Detroit regional director of the NLRB has accused the companies of unfair labor practices, finding they did not bargain in good faith. The company appealed that decision to an administrative law judge, who has not yet issued a ruling.

4,"The U.S. auto industry celebrated its 100th birthday in 1996 with higher sales and a new labour accord, but it can expect tough competition from foreign shores in the coming year.
Clouds loom on the horizon, namely from Detroit's old nemesis -- Japan.
The relatively weak Japanese yen promises to give cost-conscious Big Three executives headaches. A weaker yen makes it cheaper for Japanese firms to produce vehicles in Japan and sell them in the United States.
Since April 1995, when the yen hit a high of 80 to the dollar, the Japanese currency has weakened. The rate is now about 114, meaning it takes more yen to buy one dollar.
Van Bussman, Chrysler Corp.'s top economist, believes the yen will continue in the 110-115 range for the first three to six months of 1997, then strengthen to about 100.
""I think it will be a substantial issue in 1997,"" Bussman said. ""The yen having weakened from 80 to 110 has given them tremendous profit potential in North America.""
A look back through 1996 shows that Japanese automakers have already turned the weaker yen to their advantage through lower prices.
Industry trade publication Automotive News reported the average 1997 model year price increase at Detroit's Big Three was $386, while the average price hike for Japanese automakers was a mere $8.
""It's going to be tough next year because we have the weaker yen,"" Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman said recently.
Forecasts for 1997 project total vehicle sales will be roughly the same as the 15.4 million expected for 1996. But that's not all that bad, industry executives say.
It means the four-year upswing of car, sport utilty and pickup truck sales could continue for yet another year.
""We see moderate inflation. We see a steady continuation of economic expansion in the United States,"" Trotman said. ""We're looking for the car and truck industry to fall somewhere in the 15 to 15.5 million range for 1997, which we would describe as a pretty good year.""
Japanese automakers, which have introduced hot new car and sport utility vehicles this year, are set to unleash more new products in 1997.
Honda Motor Co. Ltd. will soon introduce its CR-V compact sport utility and is scheduled to bring out new versions of its Accord sedan and Odyssey minivan. Building on the momentum of its new Camry sedan, Toyota Motor Corp. will unveil a front-wheel drive minivan called the Sienna next fall.
Among the Big Three, 1996 proved to be the year that Chrysler's raft of stylised new products took off, outshining its two domestic rivals. The No. 3 automaker has boosted U.S. market share nearly two points to 16 percent, and its calendar year sales will post their best results since 1988.
General Motors Corp. will try to reverse a slide in both sales and market share next year as it continues with the introduction of 15 new cars and light trucks, including a new line of minivans.
GM will also look to improve its overall competitiveness with a new three-year contract with the United Auto Workers that could allow it to shed 30,000 workers. But that deal did not come cheaply. GM endured several strikes through the year that will cost it more than $1.6 billion.
At Ford, cost-cutting will remain a top priority next year. The No. 2 automaker has scored big in the market place with its new F-Series pickup trucks and Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle.
But its car sales have lagged, and Ford has been forced to slap incentives on its redesigned Taurus to push them out of dealer showrooms. Ford, which replaced the head of its core automotive operations in October, will also lose hundreds of millions from European and South American operations in 1996, but sees improvements in those areas for 1997.

4,"Chrysler Corp. minivans have came under fire again from safety regulators, who said Tuesday they stepped up probes into two problems, including reports that a 90-pound rear hatch door can suddenly close without warning.
Nearly 2 million minivans are involved in the investigations, which were also sparked by reports that side sliding doors on 1996 models flew open at high speeds.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it has received reports that 39 people have been injured when the rear hatch door on 1991-1993 model Caravan, Voyager and Town &amp; Country minivans dropped unexpectedly.
The problem occurs when bolts holding cylinders that prop the door open shear, according to the federal safety agency. The agency has received a total of 477 complaints. The probe, first launched in May and upgraded on Oct. 31, covers almost 1.3 million minivans.
NHTSA also upgraded a preliminary investigation into about 582,000 1996-model Caravan, Voyager and Town &amp; Country minivans. It has received 19 complaints that the right or left sliding door can come open while the vehicle is moving.
Owners have reported doors opening a few inches or flying wide open at speeds from 15 to 60 mph. No injuries have been reported. NHTSA said it is not aware of any incidents involving vehicles built during or after January 1996.
Chrysler was the first automaker to offer a sliding door on the left side of a minivan. The feature has made the No. 3 automaker's minivans the hottest seller in a popular segment.
Chrysler agreed in 1995, under pressure from regulators, to replace the latches on the rear hatch doors on more than 4 million minivans but stopped short of recalling the vehicles, from the 1984 through 1995 model years. Safety officials said the doors could pop open during low-speed crashes.
A Chrysler official could not be reached to comment.
But the company has told the safety agency the sliding door problem may stem from incorrect latch adjustments by dealers, which the company attributed to problems with the service manual.
Chrysler also said eight of the complaints about side doors opening involved vehicles that had had door repairs made. Chrysler said it has corrected the manual procedure and has made three design changes to door components.
But NHTSA said it has continued to receive complaints about the doors opening on vehicles with no repair history.
Separately, NHTSA said it upgraded an investigation into 621,000 1995 and 1996 Windstar minivans from Ford Motor Co. Regulators have received 327 complaints about brake problems, which have led to 76 accidents and two injuries.
In addition to the incidents reported to NHTSA, Ford said it has received 64,000 warranty claims that could relate to a brake problem causing long stopping distances.
Also, NHTSA said it opened an investigation into Land Rover's Discovery sport/utility vehicle. It has received two complaints that the right front door opened on 1996 models. Rover is a unit of German carmaker BMW.
Chrysler stock fell 25 cents to $34.75 on the New York Stock exchange in afternoon trading.

4,"Labour lawyer James Hoffa, refusing to concede defeat in the Teamsters union presidential election nearly a week after his opponent claimed victory, called Thursday for a congressional investigation into the vote.
Hoffa on Tuesday formally asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to impound the ballots and initiate an FBI investigation into ""serious irregularities"" in the election.
""We really have what I call Teamstergate,"" Hoffa told reporters at a news conference Thursday at the Teamsters' Detroit offices, where his legendary father, the late Jimmy Hoffa, ruled the union in the 1950s and '60s.
Incumbent Teamsters President Ron Carey on Saturday claimed victory in the hard-fought election, winning by an apparent margin of about 17,000 votes. But 41,002 ballots were set aside for further eligibility checks, and Hoffa says more than 25,000 other ballots may have disappeared.
After all eligible votes were tallied late Saturday, court-appointed Election Officer Barbara Zack Quindel accounted for 485,605 ballots returned. But last week she reported that the total number of mail-in ballots received was 511,268, an estimate based on receipts from the U.S. Postal Service.
Hoffa said he wants an explanation for the discrepancy between the ballots counted and the ballots received.
""If I lost, I lost. I just want a fair election,"" Hoffa said.
Carey, 60, was first elected president of the 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters as a reformer in 1991. His apparent re-election was lauded by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who had remained neutral during the campaign.
Meanwhile, Quindel decided Wednesday to void 120 Hoffa votes after finding that a Hoffa backer and former officer of Teamsters Local 743 in Chicago violated election rules by collecting and mailing ballots for other members, according to her spokesman, Jeff O'Mara.
Acting on a protest filed by Carey's campaign last week, O'Mara said Quindel decided it would be too extreme a remedy to void all of the local's ballots, estimated by the Carey campaign at more than 2,800.
The ballots were among 41,002 so-called challenged ballots that are still being checked for eligibility and have yet to be counted. Although there are enough of them to erase Carey's lead, Hoffa would need to carry the challenged ballots by a better than three-to-one margin for that to happen.
The election officer has not disclosed any interim results of the tabulation of the challenge ballots. O'Mara said he did not know when the tabulation would be completed.
Hoffa said Thursday, however, that initial tabulations of the challenged ballots have cut Carey's lead by as much as 2,400 votes. He did not disclose how many votes had been counted.

4,"Union workers prepared to strike General Motors Corp for the second time this month Sunday night as bargainers for the company and the United Auto Workers struggled to reach a new contract agreement before a midnight deadline.
In a sign the pace of talks could be picking up, GM Chairman Jack Smith arrived at the automaker's headquarters early in the evening.
UAW members at pickup truck and sport/utility vehicle assembly plants in Pontiac, Mich. and Janesville, Wis. said picket signs had been made and strike schedules drafted.
""We don't know if we're going to work in the morning or not,"" said a woman answering the phone at UAW Local 95 in Janesville, who declined to give her name.
At stake is a new labor agreement for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers. GM employs more than half of the approximately 390,000 UAW members who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers. It is the only one of the Big Three to not have a new three-year labor contract.
Last week, the world's largest automaker settled a strike by 26,000 members of the Canadian Auto Workers union that shut down the Canadian operations and idled more than 23,000 workers at dozens of plants in the United States and Mexico.
""GM remains hopeful an agreement can be reached before the UAW's termination of the current 1993 national agreement at 11:59 p.m. tonight,"" GM spokesman Chuck Licari told reporters gathered at company headquarters late Sunday afternoon.
UAW spokesman Frank Joyce declined to comment on the talks. UAW President Stephen Yokich Friday said he is not optimistic a deal can be reached by the deadline.
Bargainers for UAW and GM resumed at midmorning Sunday after they adjourned Saturday evening. Analysts speculated that negotiators could be wrangling over contract language that would dictate how many workers GM is obligated to guarantee jobs for.
Bowing to UAW concerns over job security, both Ford and Chrysler have agreed to new contracts that promise to keep 95 percent of their current UAW hourly workforces except in the event of a severe industry downturn.
""I think if there's a sticking point that may be it,"" said Dale Brickner, a labor expert at the Michigan State University. ""GM may be pushing to get that figure farther down than the UAW may be comfortable living with.""
GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, is trying to shed 12 unprofitable parts plants, and wants to exclude certain component facilities from the employment guarantee. Those include a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.
In settling a 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto Workers union last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the selling of two parts plants and flexibility to outsource Yokich has not indicated what he will do after once the contract extension expires at midnight Sunday. Yokich on Friday set the Sunday deadline, but did not actually threaten a strike. Workers have been told to stay on the job until they hear otherwise.
However, there was speculation Sunday the UAW could mount a plant-specific strike if enough progress has not been met by the deadline Sunday. By hitting light truck plants such as the Janesville facility that makes Tahoe and Yukon full size sport/utilities, the union could hurt the sale of some of GM's most profitable products at a time it is trying to bounce back from the Canadian strike.
GM's U.S. operations continue to respond to the 20-day CAW strike. The more than 6,600 UAW members at GM's Buick City complex have been told not to report Monday. At the same time, GM is running radio ads telling first-shift workers at its Hamtramck assembly plant to report to work Monday.

4,"General Motors Corp., facing a rancorous strike by its Canadian workers, Tuesday reported a $1.3 billion third-quarter profit that was boosted by strong automotive results and an unsually low income tax rate.
The world's largest automaker said the combined net income of its North American Automotive Operations and its Delphi Automotive Systems parts businesses was $515 million. A year ago, the operations had a combined loss of $93 million, while the parent company posted a profit of $396.7 million.
Increased volume and favourable currency exchange rates helped GM to nearly triple its international operations profits to $323 million from $111 million a year ago.
""The third quarter results from continuing operations clearly show momentum as we continue to rebuild our strength in North America and grow our business in key international markets throughout the world,"" GM Chairman John Smith said in a statement.
The earnings, equal to $1.57 a share, compared with a profit of 39 cents a share from continuing operations. They do not include results from Electronic Data Systems Corp, which GM spun off in June. Revenues climbed to $39.1 billion from $35.3 billion in the 1995 period.
Contributing to profits was $565 million in one-time favourable items. GM recorded a $253 million after-tax gain from a reduction in the reserve to pay for plant closings, thanks to its decision to use its Wilmington, Del., facility to assemble new Saturn vehicles.
Also, GM's effective income tax rate was 2.8 percent, adding another $312 million, as the company took advantage of several tax credits, including a reinstatement of research and experimentation credits for the last half of 1996.
GM Chief Financial Officer Michael Losh told reporters during a conference call that rate is expected to return to the 27 percent range in the fourth quarter.
As it has all year, GM continued to add to its growing cash account in the third period, contributing another $1.5 billion to bring its total cash balance to $14.5 billion at the end of the quarter.
Because GM has previously set its cash goal at $13 billion, Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, believes the GM board will return some of that money to shareholders.
""I thought it was a pretty decent quarter,"" he said. ""I have a lot more confidence that they are going to raise the dividend and announce a share repurchase programme.""
Glantz said the annual dividend could go to $2.00 a share from the current rate of $1.60 at the next board meeting Nov. 4. By the end of 1997, he said GM may have in place a $3 billion share repurchase programme.
GM's third quarter net profit margin from continuing operations rose to 3.7 percent from 1.3 percent. Smith said that was good news, but noted the company still has a ways to go before it reaches its average annual profit margin goal of 5 percent over an auto business cycle.
""We still have our work cut out to improve margin performance,"" he said.
GM delivered more vehicles worldwide in the third quarter -- 2,085,000 vs. 2,060,000 -- but its global market share slipped to 16.1 percent from 16.9 percent.
The company also lost share in the U.S. car and truck market, finishing the quarter with 30.4 percent compared with 32.2 percent. GM delivered 1,182,000 vehicles in the United States during the quarter, down from 1,235,000.
But CFO Losh said the overall volume increase represented good news for the company, and was a sign there is demand for the bevy of new models it is launching.
""It's volume that drives earnings, not market share, per say,"" he said.
Another positive sign was the pace of new-model launches, said Losh. Production of full-size vans at Wentzvile, Mo., and Saturn coupes in Spring Hill, Tenn., have reached full line speed, and other plants are on schedule.
GM is in the midst of launching 15 new cars and trucks. In the third quarter, the company had nine plants actively involved in changeovers. Losh said that is the most it expects to have in a given quarter, adding GM will have seven in changeovers in the fourth quarter.
However, one of those nine plants is a facility in Oshawa, Ontario, which is the target of a strike by Canadian Auto Workers. Losh declined to say how much the strike will set back the new model launch there.
Losh also declined to comment on status of talks between both the CAW and United Auto Workers. About 26,000 CAW members began walking off the job Oct. 3 over the issue of outsourcing -- the use of outside contractors. GM also has yet to reach a new labour pact with the UAW.
On Tuesday, the number of U.S. workers idled by the strike rose to 10,297 from 5,911 on Monday.
"
4,"General Motors Corp, still feeling the effects of a 20-day Canadian autoworker strike, told all of its 5,000 Lordstown, Ohio, assembly workers they will be idled for two weeks, company and United Auto Workers officials said Thursday.
The plant, which makes the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire small cars, has run out of transmissions supplied by a GM parts plant in Windsor, Ontario.
Workers at another assembly plant, the Buick City complex in Flint, Mich., could also be idled on Friday or early next week, industry sources said. The plant, which employs 5,236 hourly UAW workers, makes LeSabre, Park Avenue, Eighty Eight and Bonneville, mid-sized cars.
""It's a situation we are looking at,"" said GM spokesman Tom Klipstine, adding the automaker continues to monitor all of its vehicle and parts production operations.
As of Thursday afternoon GM had told 23,801 assembly and parts workers in the United States and Mexico to stay home because of a shortage of parts from its Canadian operations.
The Lordstown shutdown is the second U.S. plant where GM has suspended operations completely since 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers began an escalating strike on Oct. 3. The first plant to go totally down was Detroit/Hamtramck, which makes Cadillacs.
The Lordstown plant has three crews. The first crew was told to report back Nov. 10, the second Nov. 11 and the third Nov. 12, a UAW spokeswoman said.
Losing production of the mid-sized cars is not expected to have a big impact on sales, because the automaker had between 67 and 98 days supply of those vehicles on dealer lots as of the end of September, according to Autodata Corp.
But GM could feel the impact of lost production of its popular Cavalier and Sunfire cars. The Cavalier had a 61 days supply and the Sunfire had 61. The industry generally considers 60-days supply to be ideal.
GM and CAW negotiators reached agreement on a new three-year labor pact Oct. 22. The deal was approved by CAW members Wednesday.
The Canadian operations are being brought up in stages.
"
4,"General Motors Corp, battling to avoid a second strike by assembly and parts workers this month, said it was hopeful a new labor contract could be reached before an extension deadline at midnight on Sunday.
Speaking to reporters gathered at GM's headquarters here, GM spokesman Chuck Licari said GM and the United Auto Workers were still working to resolve difficult and complex issues.
""GM remains hopeful an agreement can be reached before the UAW's termination of the current 1993 national agreement at 11:59 p.m. (0459 GMT) tonight,"" said Licari.
At stake is a new labor agreement for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers. GM employs more than half of the approximately 390,000 UAW members who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers. It is the only one of the Big Three to not have a new three-year labor contract.
UAW spokesman Frank Joyce declined to comment on the talks. UAW President Stephen Yokich said on Friday that he was not optimistic a deal could be reached by the deadline. In a sign an agreement might not be reached tonight, Licari said GM Chairman Jack Smith was not at the automaker's headquarters, although he was in touch with negotiators.
Both Ford Motor Co Chairman Alex Trotman and Chrysler Corp Chairman Robert Eaton were present for the final stages of their company's negotiations and appeared at press conferences announcing a deal.
Bargainers for UAW and GM resumed Sunday morning after they adjourned Saturday evening. Analysts speculated that negotiators could be wrangling over contract language that would dictate how many workers GM would have to guarantee jobs.
Bowing to UAW concerns over job security, both Ford and Chrysler have agreed to new contracts that promise to keep 95 percent of their current UAW hourly workforces except in the event of a severe industry downturn.

26,"The death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has had an impact in Hong Kong unseen since the 1976 passing of Mao Zedong, founder of communist China.
But it pales in comparison to the outpouring of grief that followed Mao's death, long-term residents say.
An estimated 50,000 people have visited China's official mission in Hong Kong, the Xinhua news agency building, to pay their respects at a Deng shrine in the five days since the Chinese patriarch's death last Wednesday.
Some segments of the British-ruled community of 6.4 million people also saluted Deng with gestures of mourning at the moment of his official Beijing funeral on Tuesday.
Ships blasted their horns, buses trailed black ribbons, train stations broadcast dirges, flags flew at half mast, and schoolchildren stood at attention in respectful silence.
Deng, purged by Mao before becoming China's unquestioned leader in 1978, orchestrated China's opening to the West and its economic reforms, as well as Beijing's blueprint for taking back Hong Kong from Britain on July 1.
Mao died in 1976 after a rule marked by numerous purges of the communist leadership and revolutionary upheavals climaxing in his disastrous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
Still, hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong mourned his passing, long-term residents said.
""With Mao, huge numbers of people poured into a hall crying. It was very mournful,"" said Hong Kong politician Elsie Tu.
""It brought tears to our eyes as we felt the end of an era,"" said the 83-year-old Tu, a former missionary in China.
Long-term resident and former China-watcher John Dolfin said the turnout for Mao was massive and the salutes ear-splitting.
""The lines curled three abreast around the Bank of China building, and all through the park. There must have been thousands in the line at any given time. It took an hour and a half to get in,"" said Dolfin.
""The line was much smaller for Deng. It was very quick. And there wasn't much emotion,"" Dolfin said.
""For Mao every boat in the harbour stopped and blew their whistles. It was deafening. But today the harbour was virtually empty when the whistles were blown.
""Chairman Mao very much still held authority when he died, unlike Deng, who frankly was not really the 'paramount leader' for a number of years and held no official positions of power when he died,"" Dolfin said.
Szeto Wah, a pro-democracy politician and critic of Beijing, recalled Mao's mammoth personality cult.
""The reaction for Mao was much stronger than for Deng because he was like a god. It was like the death of a god. All of China felt helpless,"" said Szeto.
""People went to mourn Mao at the Bank of China building. The atmosphere was very grievous but also very nervous because the Cultural Revolution had not yet finished,"" he said. ""An important difference was that there had not been any news about Mao's condition, whereas Deng's condition has been frequently reported before he died.""
Arthur Hacker, a long-term Hong Kong resident and former government information officer, recalled 1976.
""They dismantled the enormous sign on the top of the Bank of China building which said 'Chairman Mao Lives Forever',"" he said.
""Everybody went to the Bank of China, opposite the old cricket club. Xinhua was very invisible in those days,"" Hacker said. ""There were wreaths all over the bank's wall, and queues of people. There were red flags all over the place.""
"
26,"China launched the contest to pick Hong Kong's future leader on Friday, hailing the event as the birth of ""real democracy"" in the British-ruled territory which is set to revert to Beijing's control next year.
But pro-democracy protesters disagreed -- they stormed into the building where Hong Kong's rich and mighty had gathered to vote, and, waving imitation black coffins, they denounced the exercise as the death of freedom.
Only 400 of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people are participating in the voting, having joined a special Selection Committee set up under China's close supervision.
Shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa and his principal rival, former Chief Justice Ti Liang Yang both scored more than the minimum of 50 votes required to reach the next leg of the contest to select the first post-colonial Chief Executive.
Tung took a commanding lead with 206 votes. Also through to round two is businessman Peter Woo, but five contenders including former appeals court judge Simon Li fell out of the race.
The run-off will be on December 11.
The gathering of the Selection Committee, inaugurated by China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who was visiting the territory for the first time, was marred by scuffles when pro-democracy activists clashed with police.
A dozen demonstrators scrambled into the plush Hong Kong Convention Centre in an unsuccessful bid to disrupt the historic meeting. Police chased protesters up six floors of escalators before they were rounded up and detained.
Outside, a police officer received a bloody nose and three more demonstrators were carted away in scuffles between about 40 activists and 100 police.
In his inauguration speech Qian declared the selection process as the dawn of genuine democracy in Hong Kong.
""For Hong Kong's people to elect their own chief executive, that is something unprecedented in Hong Kong's history,"" he said.
""For some 150 years Britain has appointed 20 or so Hong Kong governors, and when were the views of Hong Kong people ever consulted?"" Qian asked the assembled caucus.
""The establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is the start of real democracy in Hong Kong, and not the end of democracy in Hong Kong,"" he said.
Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight next June 30.
Tung, 59, Yang, 67, and Woo, 50, are now the only hopefuls left in the race, and Qian was at pains to stress that despite claims by critics that the winner had been chosen in advance by China's communist rulers, the result was not preordained.
The democracy activists brandished posters of jailed Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng and banners condemning China's plan to replace Hong Kong's elected legislature.
""Free Wang Dan, release Wei Jingsheng, oppose the provisional legislature"", they shouted through loudhailers.
The democracy lobby brands the leadership race undemocratic and has campaigned against the provisional legislature.
""The provisional legislature is a great step backwards for democracy,"" one protest banner said on Friday.
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind warned China on Thursday its plans for a provisional legislature risked creating ""confusion and uncertainty"" in Hong Kong.
""China would have to explain to Hong Kong and the world why they had chosen to replace a body for which more than a million Hong Kong people voted by one chosen by a handpicked electorate of only 400,"" he told a parliamentary debate in London.
"
26,"Hong Kong's ride to Chinese rule hit a new bump on Wednesday when future leader Tung Chee-hwa put on hold a trip to the United States during which he had planned to calm fears over the British colony's handover.
Tung's move came as the man who will effectively face him as opposition leader, Martin Lee, became the focus of media attention in the United States on a tour in which he has issued gloomy warnings of a Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong.
Tung, who will be Hong Kong's chief executive, said he was too busy at home, where there are 76 days left before Britain leaves and China's red flag is hoisted at midnight on June 30.
""The chief executive believes his focus must be in Hong Kong,"" Tung said in a statement.
Selected by a China-controlled committee in December to run Hong Kong after Beijing resumes sovereignty, Tung had planned a pre-handover visit to the United States to soothe anxiety there about planned curbs on Hong Kong's political liberties.
The cancellation comes despite calls by U.S. executives in the territory, worried that excessive gloom about Hong Kong could harm business ties, for Tung to go to Washington.
A spokesman for his office said Tung set great store on Hong Kong's ties with Washington and would try to make the visit by the end of this year.
He denied the postponement was linked to the visit by Lee, leader of the popular Hong Kong Democratic Party, who is meeting President Bill Clinton at the end of the week.
""He's just too busy,"" the spokesman said.
Lee has dominated headlines about Hong Kong lately as he toured Europe and North America, warning of China's plans to curb protests and foreign funding of political groups, and to replace the elected legislature with a handpicked body.
In New York, Lee said at the United Nations that the West was morally obliged to make sure China keeps its 1984 treaty promises that Hong Kong will remain a free capitalist society.
""It becomes the moral obligation of every government that supported the (treaty) at least to ensure that China will adhere to her promises made in 1984 and keep Hong Kong free,"" he said.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after meeting Lee that she plans to attend the Hong Kong handover ceremony this year, and warned that Washington was watching.
""I will emphasise America's continued involvement in protecting our interests and supporting Hong Kong's people as they enter the Chinese nation,"" she said.
Meanwhile, the pace of politics in Hong Kong was quickening.
On Tuesday, the two countries clinched an agreement to let China's People's Liberation Army send 40 troops into Hong Kong next Monday to start getting facilities ready for the future Chinese garrison.
On Wednesday, the two sides agreed to sell 98 hectares of government land to boost the supply of development land, which should help to ease a chronically tight housing supply.
Police forces in Hong Kong and China also agreed to step up joint efforts to combat a tidal wave of illegal immigration into the territory involving mainly children and pregnant women.
But on Monday, China angered Britain by unilaterally setting rules on who will have permanent residency rights in Hong Kong after July 1. Britain said the ""right of abode"" decision should have been taken jointly through diplomatic negotiations.
Beijing wanted to force Britain to recognise a China-appointed legislature by agreeing to let the body process the new residency law, senior officials told Reuters.
"
26,"Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe's flight to the United States via Hong Kong may be the last great escape of its kind, as China is sure to try to shut down the route next year, activists and analysts said on Wednesday.
Since Beijing sent tanks into Tiananmen Square in 1989 to put down a student-led protest movement, hundreds of Chinese dissidents have fled through Hong Kong in a secretive operation codenamed Yellowbird, activists said.
Wang, now in the United States, has not appeared in public yet, and it has not been confirmed that it was Yellowbird that helped him flee from the south China province of Guangdong last Friday.
But the underground escape route is bound to be sealed off when Hong Kong becomes a part of China next July 1, ending a century and a half of British colonial rule.
""China will have sovereignty here and technically it could prevent even a dissident who was given asylum by a foreign consulate here from actually leaving the territory,"" Robin Munro, director of Human Rights Watch Asia, told Reuters.
""So I expect that it's virtually going to come to an end as of July next year.""
China on Tuesday loudly signalled its stance on future dissident tangles with Hong Kong. It branded Wang's escape an illegal frontier crossing and demanded that he and his abettors be punished for breaking the law.
""The judicial authorities are currently pursuing the legal responsibilities of Wang Xizhe and the plotters,"" foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said in Beijing.
Very few in Hong Kong have any illusions that the territory will continue to be a conduit for dissidents to get out, or as a centre of pro-democracy anti-communist activism after 1997.
""Hong Kong will be subject to more pressure from the central government. Therefore it will be more difficult for dissidents to use Hong Kong as an escape route,"" said Peter Lee, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
And those who help Chinese dissidents may have a tough time. ""I think they will be liable to some kind of harassment and otherwise legal punishment,"" Lee said.
Lee Wing-tat, a legislator and key figure in the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, an organisation that supports fleeing dissidents, said his group was likely to face trouble from China next year.
""A Chinese official made a statement a few months ago. He said if people participated in helping political dissidents escape from China, China will do something... My guess is some kind of punishment,"" Lee Wing-tat said.
But his group was pressing on with help for dissidents who are now exiled in Hong Kong and seeking asylum in the West.
""We will give them assistance, for example we will arrange some places for them to live, contact the Hong Kong government and foreign consulates, and arrange money for their family.""
China's communist rulers have made clear they will not allow Hong Kong to become a centre of subversion.
China's Hong Kong policy boss Lu Ping said this year Beijing would not tolerate anti-constitutional preaching in Hong Kong.
Munro sees a bleak future for the Chinese dissidents in exile here after the handover and says they should all get out.
The three foremost candidates for Hong Kong's post-colonial leadership, who are now campaigning for support, made clear on Tuesday they would not upset Beijing by defending dissidents.
""There will be laws in Hong Kong and it is up to the chief executive to implement and obey the law... Whatever one does, it must be in the interests of of Hong Kong people,"" said shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, considered China's favourite candidate.

26,"The skyscrapers are decked with fairy lights. Red-cloaked Santas pat children on the head. Christmas carols ring out. It is Christmas in Britain's last major colony, but will it ever be like this again?
The most spectacular Christmas light displays in the world are strung from Hong Kong's skyscrapers, featuring giant illuminated Santas and reindeer covering entire facades, beaming a rainbow of colours along the famed Hong Kong harbour skyline.
Hong Kong -- shopping paradise of the world -- is awash with Christmas. Its glass and marble malls brim with exorbitant festive displays, its shops push the fanciest, most expensive brand names in the world, specially repackaged for the season.
But after Britain pulls out and Communist-ruled china takes over next July, what then?
Will Christmas turkey, Christmas pudding and Christmas cake be allowed to grace the yuletide dinner table? Even if it does, will it taste the same?
Will revellers pull Christmas crackers and drink themselves silly in merriment as many do today?
Will China allow bourgeois extravagance and Western customs? Will charities run their ""Operation Santa Claus"" fundraising drive for the disadvantaged and underprivileged? Will Christians be free to worship at Midnight Mass?
If China lives up to its promises, the answer to all these questions is a resounding ""yes"".
China has promised to allow Hong Kong to retain its freewheeling capitalist system for a further 50 years, as a quasi-autonomous part of the motherland under a ""one country two systems"" policy. This means freedom of religion will stay. And the hybrid cocktail of customs and traditions, too.
However, many of Hong Kong 6.3 million people worried that pro-democracy protests such as a Christmas Eve vigil and the mass dispatch of Christmas cards to mainland dissidents by human rights groups on Tuesday might not be allowed again.
It is also doubtful if Queen Elizabeth's Christmas broadcast will ever again be on Hong Kong public radio and television.""
Christmas is still going to be a holiday next year in Hong Kong, as is the other main Christian festival, Easter.
Only the Queen's official birthday and World War Two victory holidays are to be removed after China takes over.
And, in this overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese territory, there are more non-Chinese than ever, despite the gradual departure of expatriate colonial civil servants and company executives.
There are 37,000 Americans, 33,000 British and 30,000 Canadians, enough to keep a few Christmas parties going. The largest foreign group, 140,000 Filipinos, mostly brought in as servants, are also a strong Christian community.
Nevertheless, there are misgivings how much will remain the same in Hong Kong. And there's a whiff of melancholy and pre-nostalgia among expatriates this festive season.
It's almost like a ""last supper"", their minds tilted towards midnight next June 30, 1997, the moment when the British flag will be furled away here forever.
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's annual ""Christmas Song Choice"", which will be aired on local radio, reflects the mood.
His selection starts with Louis Armstrong singing ""Basin Street Blues"", followed by ""As Time Goes By"" by Jimmy Durante.
Patten gathered his family and friends on Wednesday night, Christmas night, for a traditional dinner of roast turkey.
All assembled were aware it could be the last Christmas dinner in the regal Government House overlooking the harbour.
Patten's successor Tung Chee-hwa, who will be Hong Kong's first Chinese leader, has indicated he doesn't want to live in the mansion that symbolises Hong Kong's one and a half centuries of British colonial rule and 150-plus years of China's national shame. He says the residence is cramped and inauspicious.
So no more Christmas there, at least.
Hong Kong's final year as a British colony has seen the balance of power tilt into China's orbit, even before the change of flag arrives. Chinese influence waxed and Britain's waned.
However, just as Christmas has become a commercial success in Japan, the festival will inevitably live on -- Chinese-style.
Hong Kong Chinese vie with each other to lavish expensive presents on their children.
Even over the border in mainland China, Christmas shopping sprees are catching on. There, Santa Claus has taken to riding a rickshaw, instead of a sleigh.
"
26,"Thumbing its nose at Britain, China brought Hong Kong's elected legislature a step closer to oblivion on Saturday when it founded a new lawmaking body to take over next July when it takes back the colony.
The birth of the Provisional Legislative Council in the frontier city of Shenzhen brought Hong Kong to a crucial turning point in its journey towards Chinese rule at midnight next June 30 and opened the way for a possible clash in the world court.
The body, stuffed with pro-China politicians and tycoons, was attacked by Britain, Washington and local protesters. London challenged China to let the International Court of Justice in The Hague rule on its legality.
The legislative body is a big crease in Sino-British relations that could cause instability in the territory in the run-up to the handover, now less than 200 days away.
The speaker of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and 32 other incumbent lawmakers were among the 60 members chosen by a 400-member China-controlled Selection Committee.
Congratulating the 60, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen declared the contest had been ""just, fair, open and based on democratic principles"" and had the approval of a wide spectrum of Hong Kong society.
Dominic Chan, recently expelled from the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, also grabbed a seat. The Democratic Party has boycotted the selection as anti-democratic.
The winners included pro-China politicians such as Tsang Yok-sing, Elsie Tu and Peggy Lam, who were routed in 1995 Legco elections when more than a million people went to the polls and voted resoundingly for pro-democracy forces.
Pro-democracy groups staged noisy protests in Hong Kong declaring the Shenzhen meeting a ""fake election"" and a ""black day for democracy"". They launched 50 helium-filled balloons into China with a protest banner attached.
""Today we will have two legislatures...This is a constitutional crisis,"" said the Democratic Party's Andrew Cheng, a current legislator.
Beijing's communist rulers are bent on imposing themselves firmly on Hong Kong and on ending 150 years of national shame over the forced cession of the territory to Britain in 19th century wars over the opium trade.
Governor Chris Patten, who has introduced elements of democracy in this territory of 6.3 million people over the past four years, denounced the Shenzhen vote as a ""bizarre farce"".
""The reality is that over a million people in Hong Kong voted for the present Legislative Council. And up over the border now, 400 people -- 400 -- are voting for a so-called provisional legislature,"" Patten said on Saturday.
Dorothy Liu Yiu-chu, a Hong Kong member of China's parliament -- the National People's Congress -- and the Selection Committee, dissented and stayed away from the vote.
""I am sick. This is the official reason from the point of view of the Selection Committee. But I know, and I don't mind letting the world know, the real reason is that I don't agree to the establishment of the provisional legislature,"" she said.
Earlier this month she took part in the committee's first task, selecting shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa as Patten's successor.
Tung dismissed Britain's suggestion of world court arbitration on Saturday, saying: ""We cannot have a legal vacuum in 1997. This is a great day for Hong Kong.""
China's official spokesman in Hong Kong, Zhang Junsheng, said Britain's challenge would not undermine the provisional legislature's authority.
""Establishing the provisional legislature is an internal affair of China. If Britain demands international arbitration it is absurd and ignorant,"" Zhang told the Mad Dog Daily.
The U.S. Consul-General in Hong Kong, Richard Boucher, called the legislature vote ""a backward step"".
""We think it's a bad idea and a mistake,"" Boucher said. ""I don't think we would describe it as an open and fair election which is an essential part of Hong Kong's future stability and future business environment.""
Democratic Party leader Martin Lee has vowed to seek a court injunction against the provisional body if it meets in Hong Kong before July 1.
""If this sham legislature is lawful, why not appoint it and have it meet in Hong Kong, where the Supreme Court can decide on its legality,"" Lee said on Friday.
"
26,"An overture by China to bring its critics into the team picking Hong Kong's future leadership shows openness but might split the democratic camp in the British colony, analysts said on Tuesday.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this month the 400-member body that will choose the chief executive and legislators who will run the territory after its July 1, 1997, transfer to China could include people with divergent views on democracy.
His remark at a Beijing meeting was taken in the colony as an olive branch towards Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party, which so far has been excluded from transition arrangements.
Although pegged to the acceptance of China's plan for an appointed ""provisional legislature"" to replace the current fully elected council, the remark was in stark contrast to China's harsh invective against the party over the past year.
The gesture is also fuelling heated discussion in local political circles and newspaper columns about China's motives.
""It might be an attempt to split the democrats, but more probably Beijing has realised that they've failed to split them so far and it's time to get them on board,"" Hong Kong University political analyst Nihal Jayawickrama told Reuters.
""I'm sure there are elements in the Democratic Party who will feel the urge to respond positively,"" he said.
But Democratic Party leader Martin Lee last weekend rejected the idea of joining the Selection Committee, saying that would amount to recognition of an illegitimate body.
The party argues that China's plan to scrap the present legislature and appoint a new ""provisional"" one has no basis in law or in the handover treaties with London.
""So long as China insists that any participant must assist in both selection processes -- Hong Kong's future chief executive and the provisional legislature -- I can't see how they can get the democrats on board,"" Jayawickrama said.
But he said it was likely the temptation would prove strong for some of Lee's associates and that they would quit the party.
China is very eager to give the Selection Committee a greater air of legitimacy by including some democrats, some China analysts in Hong Kong believe.
""At the end of the day, it's a question of who gets into the committee. And I don't think people like Lee or (deputy party leader) Szeto Wah would get in even if they are nominated,"" political commentator Andy Ho told Reuters.
The leaders of the party, the biggest in this territory of 6.2 million people, have drawn Beijing's wrath since 1989 when they sided with the student-led, pro-democracy movement that Chinese army tanks crushed in Tiananmen Square.
""We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that China has changed its position towards the Democratic Party,"" Ho said. ""It just wants to create an impression of openness.""
Some of China's Hong Kong advisers differ in their view of Qian's remarks. Tsang Yok-Sing, a pro-Beijing politician, has said he did not see them as an invitation to the democrats.
Emily Lau, an outspoken independent democrat who has often riled China's communist rulers, interpreted Qian's comment as a brazen effort to drive a wedge into the democratic movement.
Qian had divided the pro-democracy camp into ""people who are prepared to compromise their principles and those who will stand firm"", Lau wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.
""With the scramble for seats on the Selection Committee having begun in earnest, it will rapidly become clear that some members of the pro-democracy camp are eager for a place... These people have long been itching to open dialogue with Beijing and are now only too eager to be given recognition,"" Lau wrote.

26,"Hong Kong's future government has hit a new snag, with a shortage of trained staff forcing it to cancel a sitting of a controversial legislature preparing new laws ahead of the territory's handover to China.
It is the latest in a series of difficulties facing Tung Chee-hwa, the China-backed shipping magnate who will rule Hong Kong after the British pull out at midnight on June 30.
Tung's office said on Wednesday  thatthis Saturday's session of the provisional legislature, which had been scheduled to deal with a draft law on new flags, had been dropped from the diary. Just a briefing would take place.
""The draft bills aren't ready because there aren't enough people,"" Bob Howlett, a spokesman for Tung's office, told Reuters. He said Tung's coordinator, Michael Suen, concluded the office did not have enough draftsmen to prepare planned laws.
""He doesn't want to see a rushed job done on anything,"" Howlett said.
British Governor Chris Patten has refused to second more staff to the Tung office from the Hong Kong civil service to help the future government ready itself for the handover.
The office has only two law drafters on its staff.
Communist-ruled China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, a British colony for the last 156 years, under a 1984 treaty that allows the territory virtual autonomy for another 50 years.
China, angered by democratic reforms introduced by Patten in the twilight years of British rule, set up the provisional legislature in December to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council (Legco).
Many of China's critics consider the interim body unconstitutional.
""I think it's a good thing there's now no legislation going forward this week, and it would be even better if no legislation goes forward at any time, because anything they do handle between now and June 30 is vulnerable to legal challenge after the first of July,"" said Patten's spokesman, Kerry McGlynn.
""That can't be in anybody's interests. We've always made it perfectly plain, and will continue to do so up to June 30, that we'll do nothing to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the current Legco by providing any kind of assistance to the provisional legislature,"" McGlynn told Reuters.
A spokesman for the provisional legislature said the body would now organise a briefing on Saturday on the planned civil rights curbs, instead of a full-fledged legislative session, at its base in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen.
Tung's run-up to his new job as Hong Kong chief executive has been a bumpy one.
Sino-British disputes were stoked this month after Tung launched a plan to curb political liberties such as the right to protest and the right of political groups to receive foreign funds. He provoked a domestic and international outcry.
Last week he admitted to the media that he had donated 50,000 stg ($81,500) to the ruling British Conservative Party in 1992, sparking cries of hypocrisy.
""They seem they can't get their act together,"" a government official said of the latest setback. ""Tung's office is finding it nigh impossible to do the drafting, even though they still seem determined to go head with it.
""The Chinese side has painted itself into a corner with the provisional legislature. They've got themselves into a real pickle.""
"
26,"China is pressing ahead with a controversial plan to roll back civil rights and democracy in Hong Kong, with its tough line on the territory unshaken by the death of leader Deng Xiaoping.
Deng, who died last week, was the architect of the ""one country two systems"" formula for the conversion of Hong Kong into a special, autonomous capitalist zone of China when British rule ends at midnight on June 30.
Despite widespread misgivings about China in this bustling territory of 6.4 million people, thousands of residents paid respects to Deng for the fourth day on Monday in a mourning ceremony at China's official mission.
On Sunday night, China's parliament approved a plan to throw out or amend a clutch of Hong Kong laws, including those that provide for democratic elections and protect civil liberties.
The plan trims back a bill of rights, a law on forming political parties and another on free association which takes a liberal approach to public protests and demonstrations.
The laws were part of London's effort to create a democratic framework in Hong Kong in the twilight of more than 150 years of British rule.
Beijing has justified its onslaught against Hong Kong's fledgling democracy by accusing Britain of treaty violations with Hong Kong's recent democratic reforms.
""China's latest move means the die is now very much cast,"" a spokesman for the Hong Kong Democratic Party told Reuters in reference to the National People's Congress's (NPC) Sunday decision.
""China has shown it is not going to respect the will of Hong Kong people. The NPC is a political body making a decision that will remake Hong Kong in blatant breach of handover agreements which say Hong Kong's laws shall remain unchanged.""
He said the move violated both the internationally registered 1984 Sino-British handover treaty, known as the Joint Declaration, as well as Hong Kong's future constitution, the Basic Law.
Beijing's move to crimp basic freedoms flies in the face of official protests by Britain.
London has challenged China to go to the World Court to seek a ruling on the legality of Beijing's plan to replace Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council with an appointed provisional legislature.
In a related development, a leading Hong Kong member of the Preparatory Committee on the handover told reporters Hong Kong would not be allowed to amend new election rules that the panel was preparing for the territory.
Neither Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting, Tung Chee-hwa, the provisional legislature, nor the post-colonial government, could change the rules, Lau Siu-kai said.
Slightly over half of Preparatory Committee members are from Hong Kong and the rest are from the mainland. Its decisions generally echo policy statements by senior Beijing officials.
The rules would govern the first election of a long-term legislature some time in 1998 to replace a provisional body that China has appointed to make laws from July 1.
It had not been clear how much say Hong Kong people would have in setting the rules.
A Hong Kong business leader and pro-China politician set to join Tung's Executive Council said the cabinet would play a much greater role in policy making than it had done under outgoing colonial Governor Chris Patten.
But the businessman, Henry Tang, head of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, also said he expected no big policy changes under Tung, a Shanghai-born shipping billionaire.
"
26,"Hong Kong, wary about upsetting its future Beijing masters when dissenters use it as an escape route, kept silent on Monday about Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe following reports he had fled to the British colony.
Human rights activists in Hong Kong said Wang, 46, fled here from his home in China's neighbouring Guangdong province over the weekend, just days after the communist authorities in Beijing bundled a colleague into a labour camp.
He was expected to leave Hong Kong soon, they said, possibly by Monday night, and probably for the United States.
The U.S. Consulate declined to confirm or deny that Wang had asked for asylum. ""We don't comment on asylum cases,"" consulate spokesman Patrick Corcoran said.
Wang would be the second Chinese dissident known to have fled to the United States via Hong Kong this year. Liu Gang fled last May after months of police harassment following a six-year prison stint for helping to lead the 1989 student protest movement.
""According to our information Wang is safe at the moment,"" Robin Munro, Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, told Reuters.
""I think it's likely he'll probably be going on somewhere else fairly soon,"" Munro said.
Munro said he was unable to say where Wang was heading, but other human rights sources in Hong Kong said he was seeking refuge in the United States.
Washington has been generous in granting asylum to Beijing's political critics since a military crackdown against the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
Scores, perhaps hundreds, of Chinese dissenters have fled to the West since then through Hong Kong, local activists say.
""I assume he was about to be arrested by the Chinese authorities. I can't think what else would have prompted such a rapid departure,"" Munro said, attributing Wang's move to the three-year sentence passed on dissident Liu Xiaobo last week.
Wang and Liu sparked reprisals against remaining dissidents last month when they wrote a letter demanding the impeachment of President Jiang Zemin for violating the constitution by placing the army under Communist Party, rather than state, control.
Human rights sources said it was unlikely Wang would speak publicly in Hong Kong but that he would explain himself when he reached his destination.
As Hong Kong prepares to revert to Chinese sovereignty next July 1, issues of human rights, and especially help for mainland dissidents, have become acutely sensitive.
""The Hong Kong government asks such people to keep quiet while they are here as the price for facilitating their smooth exit from the territory,"" one human rights source said. ""And the Americans go along with that quiet, too,"" he said.
Munro saw the latest developments in China as a blow.
""It's extremely discouraging and quite deplorable the way the (Chinese) government has intensified its crackdown on the few remaining dissidents in China in recent weeks,"" said Munro.
He said the dissident movement in China had effectively been crushed, with all prominent dissidents either in jail or forced into exile.
""The saddest thing about it is that Wang appears to have concluded there's no way he could continue to struggle for change from within the country,"" Munro said.
Wang's activism dates from 1974 when he co-authored an attack in Guangdong on the radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
He took part in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement in Beijing and produced his own dissident newsletters. He was twice imprisoned and spent some 17 years in jail and labour camps.
He was released on parole in 1993, and before he fled he had been under constant police surveillance.

19,"European parliamentarians urged Hong Kong people on Tuesday to ""speak up and not shut up"" in the face of growing fears that China will roll back democratic freedoms when the territory reverts to China.
They also said they will recommend to the European Parliament to urge Britain to contest China's decision to replace the territory's elected legislature with an appointed interim chamber at the handover at midnight of June 30.
""Our message to Hong Kong is don't shut up, speak up,"" said Graham Watson, a member of the British Liberal Democratic Party, at a news conference during a two-day visit.
Citing a European maxim, Watson said, ""What is required for evil to triumph is for good people to remain silent"", adding that democracy was now the way of the world, while totalitarianism and dictatorship was evil.
Watson and three other members of the European Parliament (MEPs) met Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa, prominent lawyers and members of Hong Kong's current elected legislature, and will meet colonial Governor Chris Patten.
Hong Kong, a British colony of over 150 years, reverts to China from July 1, and fears are mounting among its 6.4 million people that its democratic freedoms and rights, introduced by Britain in the final years of its rule, will be snuffed out.
Chief amongst Hong Kong's worries is a China-crafted provisional legislature which will replace the elected chamber, and Beijing's plan to amend or strike down a string of laws protecting civil liberties and democracy.
Tung, who replaces Patten on July 1, has backed the proposed changes, arguing that they were mere technicalities and necessary to preserve social order.
The MEPs, who criticised Britain for being too late in bringing democracy and civil rights to Hong Kong, also said London should contest the legality of the shadow legislature in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
""We believe the United Kingdom would have a good case...for going to the United Nations, even the Security Council and asking for the matter to be referred to the ICJ,"" Watson said.
""We believe that the abolition of the elected Legislative Council is an illegal act, and we believe it should be challenged in international law,"" he said.
London has said its hands are tied on the matter as China has refused to refer the issue to the world court. The MEPs however thought the matter should be pursued.
""There is nothing to stop the United Kingdom taking it to the United Nations...we would like to see the panoply of legal instruments in due process in law be used, even if in the end the process is frustrated,"" Watson said.
A dozen activists staged a noisy protest at the office of future leader Tung on Tuesday morning, demanding an apology for his support of China's plans.
The group, a coalition of 27 grassroot organisations which called itself the Hong Kong People's United Front for the Defence of Human Rights, chanted slogans and called on Tung to relate the views of Hong Kong people to Chinese leaders.
""We strongly request the future chief executive to apologise to all Hong Kong people and to honestly reflect their views to the Chinese government and to do his duty by defending human rights, freedom and the rule of law,"" the group said in a letter later given to Tung's office employees.
"
19,"China endorsed Hong Kong's Tung Chee-hwa on Thursday as the man to lead the territory after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
The 59-year-old shipping magnate proved the overwhelming choice of a Beijing-vetted panel to lead the territory after the British pull down the flag, ending more than 150 years of colonial rule.
The Preparatory Committee, the 150-strong body of prominent Hong Kong and Chinese citizens established to manage the handover, extended China's recognition of Tung's new role at a session in the southern China boomtown of Shenzhen.
The endorsement was proposed by Preparatory Committee vice-chairman Wang Hanbin. ""If you don't have any objection, then approve it by applauding,"" Wang said.
The delegates, who include some of Hong Kong wealthiest and most powerful tycoons and deal-makers, dutifully clapped in unison.
Tung, whose father fled the Chinese communist revolution in 1949, will take over the helm when the colony reverts to China in 201 days' time, at midnight on June 30.
Tung said on Thursday that China's role in bailing out his family shipping empire when it ran into trouble a decade ago would not affect his leadership.
""Gratitude is one thing. Being the chief executive is another. The chief executive has to put interests of Hong Kong people before anything else,"" Tung said in an interview with Cable Television.
Hong Kong newspapers, many of which had prepared celebratory issues ahead of Wednesday's poll in which Tung eclipsed his two rivals by taking 80 percent of votes cast, heralded him as proof that Hong Kong people could run Hong Kong.
Tung has said he will take a hard line against meddling by provincial bosses who may seek to disregard Beijing's edict that Hong Kong will be a Special Administrative Region of China with considerable autonomy in governing its own affairs.
Hong Kong's Economic Times newspaper said China was expected to rank the future chief executive equal in status to a state councillor.
This position, one level below vice-premier, would mean he outranks provincial governors and would help ensure against interference in Hong Kong affairs by regional cadres, it said.
Tung's victory was considered a foregone conclusion in Hong Kong, where he has been regarded as China's man since President Jiang Zemin singled him out for a pointed handshake in January.
The Preparatory Committee is scheduled to address during the afternoon session what promises to be its most controversial task -- setting the ground rules for a Provisional Legislature in Hong Kong to replace the existing elected chamber.
China, angered by the reforms spearheaded by British Governor Chris Patten, vowed to neutralise them by dissolving Hong Kong's legislature when it takes control.
Navigating this potential minefield could prove Tung's biggest immediate headache.
Opposition in Hong Kong to the new chamber is stiff and many people are deeply concerned about the confusion that may arise if two rival legislatures jockey for power in the final six months of British rule.

19,"As speculation mounted in Hong Kong about a possible link between Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd and a Chinese partner, the Hong Kong utility chose to keep mum on Thursday about its future shareholding structure.
""Today is not the time, the place to say specifically what will be done,"" deputy chairman Richard Brown told a news conference. ""There are rumours covered in the press and we don't comment on them"".
In the run-up to July 1, when the British colony of Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule, markets have been awash with rumours of state Chinese enterprises preparing to buy their way into the Hong Kong telecommunications giant.
Hongkong Telecom is 58.5 percent-owned by Cable &amp; Wireless Plc but analysts said both companies may see the wisdom in taking on a mainland partner because of the handover.
However top officials at the Hongkong Telecom news conference, where the company reported a 12.5 percent rise in net profit for the year to March 31 to HK$11.18 ($1.44) billion, declined to answer reporters' questions on the issue.
China's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) and China United Telecommunications Corp (China Unicom) have been consistently pinpointed by the local press as likely partners.
A China Unicom official told reporters on Wednesday the company was interested in buying a stake in Hongkong Telecom.
China Unicom is a joint venture of 16 major Chinese organisations, led by the ministries of power, railways and electronics industry.
Brown told reporters there were scores of companies which were interested in partnering Hongkong Telecom, but the company would only reveal details when something was firm.
A seasoned China observer said it was a foregone conclusion that Hongkong Telecom, like all other crucial infrastructure giants in the territory, will see an injection of Chinese interest, whichever state enterprise that came from.
""It's a positive and logical step. It opens scope for more cooperation with the mainland. Big state enterprises will want some kind of say in Hong Kong, after all these years,"" the observer said.
Powerful Chinese enterprises like CITIC Pacific have claimed large chunks of the territory's air carrier Cathay Pacific Ltd and utility China Light and Power, while China National Aviation Corp bought nearly 36 percent of Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd last year.
An analyst with a foreign research firm, who declined to be named, said some investors viewed positively talk of a Unicom stake in Hong Kong Telecom. But he noted that Unicom had problems of its own.
""It is struggling with MPT and has so far nothing much apart from a mobile business in China,"" he said.
""Unicom has a host of shareholders from many different ministries and this could be a negative thing because all of them have different, conflicting views.""
Shares in Hong Kong Telecom rose to their highest level in almost a year on Thursday, gaining HK$0.80 to close at HK$15.00.

19,"Hong Kong's lawmaking chamber suffered a blow last week when its speaker broke ranks to vie for a seat in an interim body Beijing plans to install in the territory next year, political analysts said on Sunday.
Andrew Wong, Legislative Council president, made an about-turn when he said he was seeking a seat in the Provisional Legislature, a body he denounced during 1995 elections.
But his move to join 31 colleagues seeking seats in the provisional body, which China will put in place of the Legislative Council, threatens to widen schisms already dividing the chamber, commentators said.
""Cracks which have already emerged within the Legislative Council over the bid by some members for a seat on the Provisional Legislature will widen in the next six months,"" said Chris Yeung, political commentator with the Sunday edition of the South China Morning Post newspaper.
Yeung warned of a flurry of motion debates, adding that ""the normal operation of the Legislative Council will be adversely affected to a great extent, if not paralysed"".
China, angered by a string of democratic reforms implemented by colonial Governor Chris Patten, has vowed to disband the present elected legislature and replace it with the provisional assembly when Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule in mid-1997.
On Wednesday, the Selection Committee, carefully assembled by China, is expected to choose the man who will succeed Patten as the territory's first post-colonial leader.
The committee's next task is to name the 60-member Provisional Legislature on December 21.
Wong, denounced by some fellow legislators, would not say whether he supported the Provisional Legislature, but he tried to convince reporters he would remain an impartial leader of the existing chamber.
""You ought to wait until I act partially -- and when that happens, criticise me and I will retract my decisions and previous rulings,"" Wong told reporters on Saturday.
While it is not yet clear how and where the future Provisional Legislature will meet and operate before it actually assumes office next July 1, observers said the existence of two lawmaking bodies cannot auger well for the territory.
""In any country, when you have two bodies from which laws emanate at the same time, there's going to be some confusion and dispute,"" said Michael DeGolyer, associate professor at Hong Kong's Baptist University, who is in charge of a long-term study on the transition.
""For the next six months, we're obviously going to be in a very confused state. Normally this causes all kinds of political and economic chaos.""
"
19,"Hong Kong's colonial government cautioned Beijing on Monday not to cause constitutional problems by enacting laws for the territory before Britain hands it back to China at midnight on June 30.
Security Secretary Peter Lai said Beijing might spark a flurry of lawsuits that would work against its declared aim of a smooth transition for the territory.
Lai's warning came after Hong Kong's future lawmakers in a China-appointed provisional legislature said they would develop laws for the territory before July 1, when more than 150 years of British colonial rule officially will end.
Residency rights, or so-called ""right of abode"", in Hong Kong after the handover are among the issues that China wants the body to decide before the handover, but the Hong Kong government is opposed, Lai said.
""We clearly cannot accept this because there can only be one legislature for Hong Kong before July 1, and that is the legally constituted Legislative Council of Hong Kong which exists today,"" Lai told reporters.
The 60-member provisional legislature that Beijing intends to put in place of the elected legislature faces fierce opposition from the vocal pro-democracy camp.
Democrats have vowed to sue the body if it tries to make laws before July 1.
While Britain and China have agreed on major provisions on right of abode, they are deadlocked on actual legislation. Any attempt by the interim legislature to enact it into law before the handover would spell trouble, Lai said.
""Immigration/nationality matters are a notoriously litigious area...if decisions have to be taken on the basis of legislation processed by the provisional legislature before July 1, they would attract a huge amount of litigation which could paralyse the immigration system in Hong Kong after June 30,"" he said.
""That would be highly unconducive to a smooth transition.""
Hugh Davies, Britain's envoy to joint Sino-British talks on the handover, blamed Beijing for failing to reach agreements.
""We have been unable to do so (reach agreements)...because (China) is insisting this is a matter in legislative terms for the provisional legislature, which is a most undesirable outcome.""
The issue on right of abode in Hong Kong after July 1 is very close to the hearts of 750,000 Hong Kong people who have obtained foreign citizenship in recent years but who also value their permanent residency rights in Hong Kong.
Uncertainty has prompted a scramble for air tickets among migrants anxious to land in Hong Kong before midnight June 30.
Emigrants can establish permanent right of abode in Hong Kong if they return within 18 months of the handover, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing said.
Hong Kong Chinese will retain Hong Kong permanent residency status unless they stay away for more than 36 months before resettling in the territory, a spokesman for the office said.
The Hong Kong government warning appeared unlikely to stop China's plan. Rita Fan, president of the interim legislature, vowed to press on and make the draft right of abode bill into law the moment it is submitted to the provisional legislature.
""The council would commence to scrutinise the bill and ensure the procedure of three readings of the bill be completed before June 30...the legislation would then be confirmed on July 1,"" Fan said in a statement.
"
19,"When outgoing Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang joined the contest to become Hong Kong's first local leader, he opened up a competition which had been seen as a clash of business titans.
Yang, 67, resigned in September as Chief Justice in a bid to become Hong Kong's Chief Executive and step into Governor Chris Patten's shoes when the British depart at midnight next June 30.
A prim, avuncular figure, he dropped his knighthood title ""Sir"" in October, choosing to be addressed as ""Mister"".
He was knighted in 1988, the year he became the first Chinese to head the judiciary under British rule.
The former judge's nearest rival is regarded as shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa who, until Yang joined the fray, had faced a rival businessman, Peter Woo. The latest public popularity poll gave Yang 42.6 percent, well ahead of Tung's 32.9 percent.
Woo, rated third, and former appeals court judge Simon Li, rated fourth, are regarded as unlikely winners in the eyes of the Hong Kong public, who see the two laggards more as spoilers than odds-on favourites for the leadership mantle.
However, it is not the public who will be casting the votes when the winner emerges on December 11, but the 400 members of a China-controlled Selection Committee.
Trying to prove he has the common touch, Yang made a show recently of moving out of his palatial official residence on Hong Kong's Peak, along with his chauffeur-driven Jaguar, and moved into a rented apartment.
He then went on a demonstrative jaunt around the territory on public subways and ferries. But days later when he went to tour slums, he arrived in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes.
""I never imagined they were so poor,"" he said after visiting a ""cage home"", a small room with rented caged-in bedspace that can be home to a dozen people.
Yang stresses his ""neutral"" background. ""I have no business affiliation. I have no direct official connection with the civil service,"" he said.
""To that extent, I am very neutral and therefore I think I shall be able to adopt an independent view on matters and judge matters on their merits,"" Yang said.
Born in a privileged family and remembered by his former teachers in Shanghai as a thoughtful, intelligent student, Yang and his family moved to Hong Kong after the 1949 communist takeover on the mainland.
The soft-spoken, bespectacled Yang has promised a ""moderately conservative"" style of rule, without drastic changes.
""If I were to become Chief Executive, I'm at the head of a moderate, relatively conservative government,"" Yang said.
""I don't want to see more great challenges or great reforms over the initial couple of years after 1997,"" he said.
He apparently had in mind the political landscape before Patten arrived and spearheaded democratic reforms to the approval of many in Hong Kong but to China's utter fury.
Yang, a self-declared Chinese patriot, provoked a storm late last year when his misgivings about the territory's much-coveted Bill of Rights, spoken in private conversation to a senior Chinese official, were leaked to the media.
It pushed him into the limelight and attracted accusations of toadying to Beijing. Some pressure groups called for him to resign, which he promptly rejected.
Yang, who once described himself as a ""bridge between the East and the West"", appears to have ridden that storm, as the popularity polls indicate.

19,"Hong Kong's business community extended a cautious welcome on Tuesday to U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's trade privileges and said they hoped the U.S. Congress would not strike down the move.
The extension of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status was particularly important to Hong Kong, now preparing for its return to Chinese rule on July 1, they said.
""The chamber is very happy,"" Erica Ng, assistant manager of international affairs at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, told Reuters. ""Every year, we carry out lobbying activities to persuade the U.S. government to renew China's MFN.""
""We welcome the decision. However we would say at this stage it is still to receive the endorsement by Congress. There is a long way to go,"" Christopher Hammerbeck, executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told Reuters.
Clinton on Monday announced his decision to renew China's MFN status for another year, but the move is expected to face fierce opposition from Congress.
Social conservatives, organised labour and other opponents are preparing for a fight, pointing to China's policies on human and religious rights, trade and other issues.
Many in Congress were wary of China's plans to curb some freedoms in Hong Kong after the handover, Frank Martin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong, told government radio.
""Many members of Congress indicated concern on the perceived rollback of civil liberties in Hong Kong,"" he said.
Martin was in Washington last week as part of an AmCham delegation lobbying for a renewal of China's MFN status.
""Others mentioned the allegations of China's involvement in election campaign fundraising (in the United States). The trade deficit is a perennial problem -- it is neither economically nor politically sustainable,"" he said.
Hong Kong's business community said U.S. Congress members should bear in mind the importance of China's trade status to Hong Kong.
""Hong Kong could lose very much in re-export trade,"" Ng said. ""We hope that Congress can understand that it is a critical year for Hong Kong because of the handover.
""If it is not renewed, it will affect Hong Kong economically and greatly affect confidence in the territory,"" she said.
The chambers of commerce say Hong Kong could lose up to US$30 billion annually in trade and related industry revenues. Gross domestic product growth could be cut by about three percentage points and some 86,000 jobs in Hong Kong could be lost if China loses its trading privileges.
""We recognise fully not only the vital importance of China but the collateral impact it has on the prosperity of Hong Kong,"" Hammerbeck of the British business chamber said.
""The membership of this chamber employs not only 300,000 Hong Kong people but we also employ large numbers of Chinese citizens in China.""

19,"Lehman Brothers and state-owned China International United Petroleum and Chemicals Co Ltd (Unipec) on Monday announced settlement of a 22-month foreign-exchange trading quarrel and resolved to get on with business.
The US$44 million dispute over currency and swap option trading had been broiling since November 1994.
The settlement means that only one of Lehman's three high-profile disputes with Chinese state-owned companies remains to be resolved.
A joint statement by Unipec and Lehman said only that their foreign exchange trading dispute had been resolved.
""Unipec plays a vital role in China's economy as the largest importer of crude oil...with this situation behind us, Lehman Brothers is keen to get on with developing our business in China,"" Lehman said.
Unipec returned the compliment, saying that it anticipated working with Lehman in the future.  
Lehman filed a US$44 million lawsuit in New York in November 1994 claiming that the Chinese trader had reneged on obligations over certain foreign exchange and swap transactions after incurring losses.
Unipec had hit back with a counterclaim saying Lehman had taken orders from certain Hong Kong firms with which Unipec was not affiliated
""Unipec and Lehman have come to a settlement agreement. Lehman has cancelled the lawsuit, and we have cancelled our counterclaim,"" said a senior Unipec manager by telephone.
The quarrel brought unwelcome attention to Unipec and illuminated the sometimes unorthodox ways in which Chinese companies deal with foreign counterparts.
Oil industry watchers said the case had hurt the reputation of the Chinese oil trader, which was set up only in January 1993, and it would be a while before it regained the confidence of its peers.
""Damage has already been done to Unipec, and it has been suffering especially in the U.S., with everyone asking for letters of credit when the case exploded...it's better for them to close the matter,"" said an oil trading manager with a major oil company in Singapore.  
Another oil industry observer agreed, saying ""it takes a while for people to accept them back.""
Still outstanding is Lehman's US$53 million suit against China's Minmetals International Non-Ferrous Metals Trading Co, which arose in late 1994 in similar circumstances.
Minmetals subsequently filed a US$128 million countersuit, including six counter claims of fraud, alleging Lehman knew the investments were unsuitable for it.
""We would love to reach a settlement (with Minmetals). We are now in negotiations and that's about it,"" a Lehman spokesman in Hong Kong said by telephone.
Lehman in April reached a settlement with the New York branch of oil trader Sinochem, parent of Unipec, of a US$20 million lawsuit concerning losses incurred on US$300 million of securities trades which the Chinese firm refused to recognise.

19,"Long before Hong Kong's handover to China, celebrity painter Liu Yu Yi, whose portrait subjects include Beijing's leaders, is already benefiting from the return of Britain's last Asian outpost to the Chinese fold.
Spanning an entire wall in his home in Hong Kong's posh Mid-levels district is an almost finished oil painting depicting over 200 famous personalities at a feast celebrating the handover at midnight on June 30.
Central on the canvas is China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man hailed as the architect of the ""one country, two systems"" formula under which Hong Kong would be treated after the handover.
Raising a toast, Deng is flanked by President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Tung Chee-hwa, the man who will run Hong Kong after Britain hands back its colony of more than 150 years.
""I am using art to capture this momentous event that is watched by all nations of the world,"" Liu, reclining on a sofa, told Reuters during an interview.
THE CHINA BREAKTHROUGH
Trained at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, Liu shot to fame in 1993 when he sold ""Liang Xiao"" (Festive Evening) -- a flashback to a historic gathering of China's leaders in 1950 -- for HK$8.36 million (US$1.08 million).
It was the highest price paid for a contemporary Chinese work of art, and he has been hitting jackpots ever since.
He sold ""Song of the Goddess Nu Wa"" for HK$8.88 million in 1994 and ""Gathering of Immortals"" for HK$10.8 million in 1995.
THE HONGKONG CONNECTION
Whether because of his talent, access to high places or being in the right place at the right time, Liu has penetrated the ranks of the rich and influential since coming to Hong Kong in 1991.
Liu, whose entire family lived on his monthly wage of 40 yuan (US$4.80) in the 1970s, has done portraits of Hong Kong business titans such as Li Ka-shing, Stanley Ho, Simon Li, Gordon Wu and Run Run Shaw.
Mindful of the handover five months away, Hong Kong's rich and pragmatic have been embracing their mainland peers, be they politicians, businessmen or artists, and are stocking up their homes with Chinese art and antiques.
But the well-connected Liu, who drew Tung into his work on the handover more than five months before the tycoon was even selected as Hong Kong's first colonial leader, betrayed little when asked what sparked the insight.
""I just thought he was the likeliest candidate,"" he chuckled before adding that the dozen empty headslots would be drawn in after Tung announces his team-designate.
SUCCESS DIDN'T COME EASY
Liu's real break came in 1988 when ""Festive Evening"" was exibited in the Memorial Hall of the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong.
It prompted a request from Beijing for Liu to create another work. The resulting ""Ren Min Wan Sui"" or ""Long Live The People"" has adorned Beijing's Tiananmen Rostrum since 1990.
But all this did not come easy for the artist who was sent off to toil in a rural commune during the ultra-leftist years of the Mao-inspired Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
""I suffered tremendous shock, persecution. They said I was a 'black' artist, that I did not conform politically,"" Liu said.
""Seven years. Seven years I lost time to practise my art. I only came back in 1977, then I painted again,"" he said.
CULTURAL REVOLUTION HARDSHIPS PROVIDED INSPIRATION
Ironically, it was those years of persecution and aimless toil that inspired ""Liang Xiao"", his first work after the end of the revolution, and a piece which would take him till 1984.
""After the Cultural Revolution, I wanted to say many things which had been locked in my heart. I saw all the chaos and fighting. I was very depressed and I suffered a lot,"" Liu said.
""I knew this can never be repeated. I wished that it would be 'liang xiao' every night. That every night would be wonderful and whole for the country. That was what I wanted to say.""
Things have looked up since for Liu, whose works echo the leanings of socialist realism, a creed that was hammered into intellectuals and artists during the late 1950s.
Snubbing the formulaic mountains, valleys, bamboo trees and the miniature people of lofty Chinese landscape art, Liu said: ""These works have lasted for too long in China. From the Song Dynasty onwards, too many, too many.
""Under my hand, my pursuit is different...that of entry into the world, not retreat. To immerse into this world,"" he said.
FELLOW ARTISTS AND CRITICS LESS KIND
While Liu's talent as a portrait painter is admired, the material success that his brushes have brought more than just raised eyebrows from those in his trade.
Gallery owner Karl McLean, who helped sell ""Song of the Goddess Nu Wa"", said: ""He's a very good portrait painter, and has very good connections in Beijing...but the artists hate him, they think he is just political and very commercial.
""I think he's a very clever guy, he's a very smart guy. He knows how to make money and he knows how to handle the rich. He knows how to get them to pay up big time,"" McLean told Reuters. (US$1 = HK$7.73)

19,"China-controlled China Everbright Holdings Co Ltd emerged from out of the blue on Friday as the new China link for HongKong Telecommunications Ltd, analysts said.
Months of suspense were ended earlier when Hong Kong-based conglomerate CITIC Pacific Ltd said it would sell its 7.74 percent stake in Hongkong Telecom to China Everbright, a holding company controlled by China's State Council.
""It's not surprising that they will want a minority stake in a large strategic asset like Hongkong Telecom,"" said Andrew Fernow, director of research at Vickers Ballas.
But analysts were at a loss to say what China Everbright could bring to Hongkong Telecom.
""The biggest question is what edge could China Everbright possibly offer to Hongkong Telecom?"" a China analyst at a European firm said. ""It's like a snake swallowing an elephant.""
China Everbright Holdings has three listed subsidiaries in Hong Kong -- China Everbright International Ltd, China Everbright Technology Ltd and China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd.
It is one of 16 equal shareholders in China United Telecommunications Corp (China Unicom), China's second largest telecommunications provider after the powerful Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT).
Unicom, set up in July 1994 at a total cost of 1.28 billion yuan (or 80 million yuan from each of its 16 partners), provides basic and long-distance telecommunications services, as well as mobile and paging facilities in China.
In recent weeks, both Unicom and MPT have been widely tipped as possible China partners of Hongkong Telecom, which as a foreign company is prevented from direct participating in China's telecom market.
But Unicom is known to be troubled by a host of problems, ranging from a lack of cash to its well-known friction with MPT. ""Unicom has no money to buy into Hongkong Telecom now,"" an analyst with another European firm said. ""As China Everbright is one of the shareholders in Unicom, it could be buying it first, and Unicom could come into the picture later.""
But while China Everbright had little in terms of assets to bring, it did have the connections in China, one analyst noted.
Zhu Xiaohua, known to be a close associate of China's economic tsar Zhu Rongji, is the chairman of China Everbright.
He had been deputy governor of the People's Bank of China and the deputy director of the economics department at the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua news agency prior to joining the China Everbright group in July 1996.
In China, however, there was at least one party keenly watching the developments that snowballed in Hong Kong.
A Unicom source said the company was watching developments but refused to disclose further details.
""Ask Everbright, or CITIC,"" the Unicom source said.

49,"China has moved a step further from its recent radical past with a decision to scrap the crime of ""counter-revolution"" and replace it with the offence of jeopardising state security, officials said on Wednesday.
The maximum penalty of death for a charge that is most commonly used against political dissidents accused of subversion would remain unchanged.
The proposal to rename the crime of counter-revolution as jeopardising state security was tabled in a draft amendment to the Criminal Law submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, or parliament, on Tuesday.
Following approval by the standing committee, the amendment that reduces the scope of the crime to 10 offences from 15 would be sent to the annual session of parliament next March for final ratification, a parliament official said by telephone.
The proposal to change the name of the crime ""was made in consideration of changed circumstances and the overall interests of the country"", the Xinhua news agency quoted Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee, as telling parliament.
The crime of counter-revolution was placed on China's books after Chairman Mao Zedong swept the communists to power in 1949 and launched three decades of radical rule when to be revolutionary were marks of a correct political attitude.
The crime of counter-revolution has for decades been a catch-all to imprison anyone of whose opinions the state disapproved or whose opinions disapproved of the state.
Its victims have ranged from writers condemned as rightists in the late 1950s and those who criticised Mao during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, to teenage students who took to the streets in 1989 to demand more democracy.
Among the most prominent dissidents serving lengthy jail terms for counter-revolutionary crimes is Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's struggling pro-democracy movement and sentenced late last year to 14 years for plotting to subvert the state.
Wei was previously sentenced to 15 years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes after he wrote an essay during the 1979 Democracy Wall movement calling for the Fourth Modernisation -- or democracy.
Parliament's Wang praised the use of counter-revolutionary crime to safeguard state security, but said times had changed.
""Political, economic and social development in recent years has given birth to a series of new problems,"" Wang said, referring to the shift away from revolution to define political correctness that has been generated by the pragmatic reform policies of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Under the draft amendments, counter-revolutionary activities as now stipulated will remain a crime -- with the exception that offences such as murder, manufacturing firearms and stealing guns will be excluded and handled as ordinary criminal acts.
Activities that aim to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat -- or subversion -- remain covered by the new crime of jeopardising state security, the parliament official said.
Under other amendments to the criminal law, an act not specifically covered cannot lead to a criminal conviction. Currently, people can be convicted based on a similar crime.
New offences will be added including organised crime, computer crime and manipulating stock markets.
Police acting in the line of duty will no longer bear criminal responsibility for causing death or injury.

49,"Xi Yang was a Hong Kong reporter looking for a scoop.
China jailed him for stealing state secrets as a warning and then freed him when it needed a chip to smoothe choppy waters as its plans for governing Hong Kong ran into a storm.
After two of the more difficult weeks so far in China's march toward its July 1 resumption of sovereignty over the British colony of Hong Kong, Beijing abruptly freed Xi Yang on Saturday from a 12-year sentence for spying and stealing state secrets.
""There really isn't much room for any other interpretation,"" said one Western diplomat in Beijing.
""They needed to make a gesture to Hong Kong to show they cared about human rights and releasing Xi Yang was probably one of the easiest ways to do that -- and at very little cost.""
Beijing prison authorities notified Xi Yang at 8.00 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Saturday morning that he was being released on parole, and 12 hours later he arrived in Hong Kong -- a free man for the first time since his arrest in October 1993.
Xi was paroled because he ""showed signs of repentance"", the official Xinhua news agency said, but gave no more details.
China viewed his article in the Hong Kong Ming Bao newspaper on Beijing's interest rate policy and its gold reserves as a theft of state secrets and central bank clerk Tian Ye was jailed for 15 years for leaking the information.
Diplomats said the harsh sentence against Xi Yang had served its purpose both as a warning to the free and feisty media in Hong Kong as to limits on their coverage after Beijing resumes sovereignty and to stop reporters from uncovering news not published in the state-run Chinese media.
""By locking him up they made their point about press freedoms,"" said one Asian diplomat.
""Whether they jailed him for two years or 50 years, it doesn't matter because they have succeeded in reinforcing the notion to Hong Kong journalists that they can't export their press freedoms into China,"" he said.
""They have made their point that 'don't think you can have it your way',"" he said.
The timing of Xi's parole was no coincidence, diplomats diplomats said.
""It's been a tough couple of weeks for them over Hong Kong, and here was a gesture of reconciliation they could make at very little cost,"" the Western diplomat said.
China and Hong Kong's outgoing colonial masters have become embroiled in a row over Beijing's plans to dilute civil liberties by rolling back the Bill of Rights and laws on freedom of association in Hong Kong after the handover.
China's decision aroused protest in Hong Kong and sparked expressions of concern from the United States.
Xi Yang's release Yang offered an opportunity to Beijing to demonstrate to Hong Kong it can be flexible on human rights, diplomats said.
Beijing has found from past experience that releasing a dissident at strategic moments can smoothe the path of international diplomacy.
China freed veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng in 1993 when it was vying to win the 2000 Olympic Games and paroled dissident Chen Ziming a year later in a successful bid to persuade Washington not to revoke its Most Favoured Nation trading status on grounds of human rights violations.

49,"China's long-delayed bid to enter the World Trade Organisation will fall under the spotlight when the world's richest nations meet to discuss its application this week, European and U.S. officials said on Monday.
Delegates of the Quad -- the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union -- will meet for lunch on Tuesday on the sidelines of the first ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Singapore, the officials said.
The European Union (EU) was trying to bring the United States on board regarding its proposal that China enter the world trade body through a phased accession process, one EU official said.
The United States says Beijing must comply with a ""road map"" to open its markets and eliminate trade and non-trade barriers before it can win U.S. support for its entry.
China had hoped to culminate its decade-long bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by becoming a founding member of the WTO at its inception two years ago.
Its application foundered on opposition over entry terms, with Beijing maintaining that the price of the road map was too high. Talks continue at a snail's pace in Geneva.
One aim of Tuesday's Quad meeting would be to try to narrow differences between the United States and Europe over terms for China's entry, terms used by Beijing to play one side off against the other, one EU source said.
Outlining his key objectives for the week-long ministerial conference in Singapore, EU Commissioner for Trade Sir Leon Brittan, stressed the need to relaunch in earnest negotiations toward Chinese membership.
""We have the remarkable changes going on in China, as well as a continuing process of economic renewal elsewhere in Asia and in Latin America...Hence the urgent need for WTO enlargement,"" Brittan told the conference opening session.
Brittan has visited China several times in recent months and has said he received a warm response from Beijing to the phased accession proposal.
In his opening address to the conference, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong also backed China's entry in a reference to pending memberships, although he repeated the United States stand that new applicants must meet the necessary criteria.
""Some of these new entrants are significant economic players, like China and Russia, their entry into the WTO would have a positive impact on the rules-based multilateral trading system,"" Goh said.
Senior Chinese analyst Pei Changhong said last week China was unlikely to concede on its demand to enter the WTO as a developing country and has the patience to hunker down for a long wait to win accession on its terms.
The United States insists that the size of China's economy ranks it as a developed country.
A goal of 1997 entry seemed an ambitious target given the distance between the United States and China on so many issues, but Pei said he hoped to see entry by 1999.
China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last month that talks with the United States on entry could be wrapped up by mid-1997.

49,"China's economic growth is likely to accelerate in 1997 as Beijing pumps up its economy before a crucial Communist Party congress that may tackle nagging reform problems, state media said on Sunday.
Political factors were likely to be a significant factor in a possible renewed boom next year in one of the world's fastest growing economies, the China Daily Business Weekly quoted Xu Hongyuan of the State Information Centre as saying.
However, Xu also warned that the higher growth could see the spin-off of a renewed burst of inflation and warned of rising joblessness, giving one of the most pessimistic unemployment forecasts to be published openly in China.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997 could reach 8,178 billion yuan ($985.3 billion), growing by 10.5 percent compared with an anticipated 9.6-9.7 percent increase this year, the newspaper quoted Xu as saying.
GDP grew by 10.2 percent in 1995 and Beijing's communist rulers have been trying to cool the rate slightly amid signs the economy was threatening to overheat. China has set a goal of eight percent average growth for the 1996-2000 Ninth Five-Year Plan.
Xu linked his higher growth forecast to the five-yearly Communist Party congress, set for late in 1997, which he said was expected to take some difficult decisions to eradicate the low economic efficiency and operational losses plaguing thousands of lumbering state enterprises.
""These political factors, if the government makes use of them smoothly, will provide strong backing to national economic performance in 1997,"" the newspaper said, quoting Xu.
Diplomats and western economists have said Beijing may try to revive an economic boom in 1997 in the run-up to the party congress as part of a push to bolster the standing of the current leadership before a meeting when personnel reshuffles are a key issue.
Xu forecast retail price inflation to speed up slightly in 1997 to about eight percent from an expected seven percent this year. Inflation was 14.8 percent last year, down from a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
Official media have been rife with speculation that China may again trim interest rates after two cuts already this year but central bank officials insist Beijing has no plans to do anything more than ""appropriately"" adjust a three-year-old tight monetary policy.
Xu said foreign trade was expected to make a strong recovery after exports slumped in the first few months of this year, especially as the government completes repayment of billions of dollars of export rebates to exporters.
He forecast exports to reach $171.5 billion in 1997, up 14.1 percent from 1996.
Xu urged a further cut in import tariffs next year, a move that Beijing has promised and which could lubricate China's bid to gain entry to the World Trade Organisation.
However, Xu forecast a sharp increase in unemployment.
In 1997, the number of people out of work in the urban area could be as many as eight million, including workers left idle because of suspension of factory production, he said.
The urban jobless rate could reach eight percent next year if both surplus workers at factories and registered unemployed were included, Xu said.
China's official registered urban jobless rate was 2.98 percent at the end of September.

49,"China hopes for a breakthrough to launch manned space flights early next century and planns to land a spacecraft on the moon in the 21st century, the Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.
Senior Chinese space officials had unveiled an ambitious, multi-million dollar and wide-ranging programme that was aimed at giving the country a competitive edge in international space development, Xinhua said, quoting senior officials.
China is known to be eager to push ahead with its space programme to expand its role in the commercial satellite business while winning international prestige through trumpeting its technological advances, industry analysts have said.
Manned space flights were being given top priority in China's space programme, which includes building a heavy solar satellite in partnership with Germany as well as developing a new generation of lightweight spacecraft to 'bus' satellites into orbit, Xinhua said.
""The country is expected to make a breakthrough in manned space technology at the beginning of the next century,"" Xinhua said, quoting Wang Liheng, vice-administrator of the China National Space Administration.
Wang gave no more details of the manned space flight programme, which has been rumoured for some time.
However, Li Jianzhong, president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, told Xinhua that China was pushing ahead with its goal to boost launch vehicle technology in the 21st century. He said the goal was to build rockets that could carry 20-tonne payloads -- more than twice the current capacity of the nation's most powerful launch vehicles.
China, which put its first satellite into orbit in 1970, has been trying to expand its role in the commercial space market, despite a series of recent setbacks.
In August a Long March 3 rocket, considered one of China's most reliable launch vehicles, failed to put a U.S.-built satellite into orbit. In February, technical flaws had even more disastrous results when a new generation Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after take-off, killing six people.
Li said China also planned to develop a reuseable space transport system and vehicle re-entry and landing systems.
Cheng Fangyun of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said a small spacecraft with low operating costs would be designed.
""China has reliable technology for space tracking, telemetry and control to do this,"" Xinhua quoted Cheng as saying.
In terms of moon exploration, China planned to provide cheap transport systems for lunar-landing spacecraft to explore the moon and developing lunar resources, Xinhua said.
Xu Fuxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology, said items under development included a scientific satellite, the Shijian-5, which was light and cheap and would become a 'bus' for small satellites.
In solar observation, China and Germany were cooperating to produce a two-tonne lunar satellite equipped with a solar telescope. The $100 million satellite was expected to be sent into orbit around 2002, said CAS member Ai Guoxiang.
China has also decided to invest 170 million yuan to build the world's most advanced sky survey telescope that could observe at least 100 million galaxies, he said.
China was working on its own space station, Xinhua said.
It is cooperating with the United States and Russia to build a magnetic spectrograph aboard the Alfa station -- scheduled to be launched early next century -- that was expected to detect anti-matter and dark matter in the universe, Xinhua said.

49,"Talks between China and the United States on a new textile accord neared a deadline on Friday for a trans-Pacific trade war, but industry experts said they expected an agreement within hours.
Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes held talks through Thursday night and into Friday evening with Chinese officials to try to iron out problems in renewal of a 1994 textile accord and to resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports.
U.S. officials said they were hoping for an agreement before the Friday deadline expires at midnight on January 31 Eastern Standard Time, but differences over market access in China appeared to be delaying progress.
Hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement, said U.S. industry representatives on the sidelines of the talks.
""We fully expect they will reach an agreement,"" said one U.S. industry representative.
""I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access,"" said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall. ""This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals.""
Hayes had been upbeat about progress in the talks on Thursday, citing significant headway on the issue of market access and saying she hoped for a deal by the end of the day. However, that failed to materialise.
Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the January 31 deadline, Hayes said earlier. The United States would not give China another extension of the deadline, she said.
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. The United States has threatened multi-million dollar penalties and raised the spectre of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Textiles are just one of a range of issues dogging a Sino-U.S. relationship that has long been strained by disputes over topics ranging from trade to human rights to Taiwan.
A U.S. delegation left Beijing on Friday after talks on human rights with Chinese officials and following a year in which all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement have been either imprisoned or driven into exile.
U.S. trade official Lee Sands wrapped up two days of talks in Beijing on Friday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), long a source of cross-Pacific friction.
Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry.

49,"China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping is spending his twilight years as an effective recluse, leaving an opportunity for power-hungry, would-be heirs fighting for his title to use his name to strengthen their hand, analysts said on Thursday.
The most blatant sign of the exploitation of the reputation of the 92-year-old elder statesman was the New Year's Day launch of a 12-hour documentary on Deng's life that showed him larger than life, glowing against a background of golden clouds radiating across the sky.
""This was done, written and arranged by those around him who would benefit from having his image... burnished up a bit,"" said one Western diplomat.
""All those who owe their fortunes to him want to make him appear in as good a light as possible,"" he said. ""The fact that they are starting the year with this shows that the pro-Deng camp seems to have the upper hand.""
The clearest immediate beneficiary was the narrator of the introduction to Wednesday's inaugural episode of the 12-part series -- Deng's own anointed heir-apparent President, Communist Party chief and army commander-in-chief Jiang Zemin.
""Jiang will be better off if Deng is able to linger for about another year and a half -- until about mid-1998,"" the diplomat said.
""It would be inconvenient for (Jiang) if Deng went now,"" he said, adding that Jiang needed the clout of the man who succeeded Chairman Mao Zedong as China's most powerful man to consolidate his position at a crucial party meeting this year.
Deng has not been seen in public for nearly three years -- a result of his own desire to retire to a behind-the-scenes role as well as his failing health, analysts say. In his last appearance he looked weak and faltering.
Speculation abounds of Deng's fragility, ranging from rumours of his sudden admission to hospital in recent days to reports that he remains at home with little change in his health but with fading lucidity.
""There is no doubt that the perception is... that he is to all intents and purposes no longer consistently lucid,"" the diplomat said, adding that the adulatory documentary was proof of Deng's waning control.
""This is the kind of thing he always avoided,"" he said, quoting from Deng himself who always openly abhorred the cult of personality that deified Mao.
Chinese analysts said the series was reminiscent of the power struggles that gripped the inner ranks of the party in Mao's last years.
""You can see that people are now using Deng just as (Mao's wife) Jiang Qing and the Gang of Four used Mao to boost their position in the years before he died,"" said one Chinese writer.
Jiang and his opponents were already lining up their pieces in the months before the high-profile handover of Hong Kong to Beijing on July 1 this year and the crucial 15th Party Congress late in the year, diplomats and analysts said.
""The transition is pretty much done now, but Jiang still needs Deng's clout behind him until everything is wrapped up with the congress and the change of government at the 1998 National People's Congress (parliament),"" the diplomat said.
The primetime documentary, carefully timed to start the year, is expected to define Deng's legacy to the current party leadership and thus future policies, political analysts said.
The main theme of the first one-hour show was reform, underlining China's commitment to Deng's pragmatic market policies that turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.

49,"Time in Tibet is a moveable feast.
In this far-flung outpost of Chinese rule, the clocks are synchronised with Beijing more than 2,560 km (1,590 miles) to the northeast, but dawn is two hours behind and everyone goes to work about two hours later than in Beijing.
It is not only Tibetan time that lags the rest of China. The economy in this Himalayan region, still based largely on yaks, goats and Buddhism, also trails.
Beijing says it is doing its utmost to narrow the gap and to make up for destruction wrought on Tibet's monasteries and temples in China's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
It has pumped more than 35 billion yuan (US$4.2 billion) into the inaccessible, remote and backward region long peopled by nomadic herders and barter traders, officials say.
The funds are also useful to buttress control of the restive and strategically important region that borders India.
The investment is slowly paying off.
Economic growth in 1995 reached 10.6 percent, up from 8.6 percent the year before. Rural per capita incomes were about 600 yuan ($72) a year while urban incomes neared 2,000 yuan ($240) -- both still about half the national average but increasing rapidly.
In the capital Lhasa, the swift growth of commerce has taken even local leaders by surprise.
""I thought it would take several years before we could attract any real interest,"" said Chen Ciduan, president of the Tibet Investment and Trust Corporation that in 1994 set up a stocks trading centre in Lhasa.
""But we had to double our space last year and we are already overcrowded and making plans for another expansion,"" he said.
That's the high flying end of economic development in Tibet.
For those at the other end of the scale, Beijing is trying to make things easier with preferential policies to help a people struggling into the late 20th century from a lifestyle that more closely resembles the middle ages.
Income tax holidays, tax breaks and easy loans are just some of the incentives available to businessman in Tibet. The concessions are also attracting numerous entrepreneurs from elsewhere in China where such favourable policies are not available.
In Lhasa, one street specialises in selling the highly-decorated, colourfully-painted furniture favoured by Tibetans. Another sells fake leather sofas that appeal to Han Chinese residents.
Chinese restaurants abound, cheek by jowl with Tibetan-managed shops selling yak butter, computer parts and bolts of brocade and wool.
Tibet offers some of China's oddest employment opportunities.
In a tiny one-room workshop leased from a struggling state-owned factory processing yak horns, seven artisans from neighbouring Yunnan province hammer traditional silver bowls embossed with Buddhist symbols.
""We were already making these Buddhist artifacts in Yunnan anyway,"" said workshop owner Li Wenhan, 26. ""It's only because there is so much demand here that we came. We could easily sell these in Yunnan, but here they need them.""
Li said 40 percent of the goods they make are for export, 20-30 percent are sold to Tibetans and the rest distributed elsewhere in China.
The success of Li's business underscores a problem in Tibet that must be as frustrating for its Chinese masters seeking to lead the region into prosperity as for many educated Tibetans.
""The Tibetans lack education and a mentality of work,"" said one Tibetan-Nepali businessman who was born in Lhasa.
""They don't appreciate the need to work, they just want to make a profit straight away,"" he said. ""It's very sad. They are too impatient to understand that you have to earn a living through steady work.""
While some might dispute that view, no one questions that Tibet is among China's poorest and most inaccessible regions. Out of Tibet's 2.3 million people, about 400,000 live below the official poverty line.
Officials oversee one of China's most innovative anti-poverty policies in the deeply devout Buddhist area where many still donate much of what they earn to monasteries and temples and where education is costly.
""We are determined to bring all Tibetans out of poverty by the end of the century,"" said an official who declined to be identified.
Almost all Tibetan government officials are involved in anti-poverty programmes. Each government department in the Tibet Autonomous Region sends officials into rural areas each year -- both to see where government money and aid are most needed and to teach poverty-stricken nomads how to boost their incomes.
Many of Tibet's worst off are nomads living in remote mountain areas, many with large flocks of yaks, goats and sheep, but with little idea of how to exploit their resources.
The nomads either use their animals to feed themselves or, when their numbers climb, set them free as an offering to Buddha to try to win merit for their next reincarnation, believing that their station in each life is dependent on their behaviour in the previous one.
""Many of these people have assets but they are still poor because they don't know how to use them,"" the official said.
Tibet does not rely on handouts alone. Since last year it has worked at setting up sister relationships with 14 of China's booming eastern cities and provinces.
These wealthy cousins each send between 10 to 20 officials to work for three years in the region over a 10-year period and also provide financial resources.
The provinces are helping Tibet with 43 projects, mostly in infrastructure. Initial investment was 2.3 billion yuan ($277.1 million) but now totals more than 3.0 billion yuan ($361 million).
""Tibet's capacity to develop itself is very low,"" the official said. ""It's hampered by its geological conditions such as lack of infrastructure and its remoteness. And it takes a long time to move away from the previous feudal serf system.
""This is a very beautiful place but we have a very arduous task ahead.""

49,"China's parliament chairman has said Beijing has no plans to expand its direct elections for local congress deputies beyond the county level and insisted his National People's Congress was not merely a rubber stamp.
In a lengthy interview published in the People's Daily on Friday, Qiao Shi also stressed the importance of developing a real legal system in China -- a cause he has espoused -- although he acknowledged that China still had a long way to go.
Qiao stressed that China had passed several laws and regulations in recent years to beef up its parliament and find ways to ensure the laws it passed were actually enforced.
Critics have described China's parliament as little more than a rubber stamp for decisions made by the leaders of the ruling Communist Party, although under Qiao's chairmanship a few members have dared to show their opposition to some measures.
However, Qiao used the interview to take an apparent swipe at a drive by President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin -- anointed heir to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping -- to bolster his image through a personal publicity campaign.
""No decisions should be made by an individual or by a small number of people,"" Qiao said when discussing the powers of the National People's Congress as well as local congresses.
""The collective performing of duties is an important principle followed by the people's congresses at all levels,"" said Qiao, one of the seven members of the standing committee of the Politburo, China's most powerful decision-making body.
China's communist leaders insist publicly that decisions are taken collectively and that state matters are handled by parliament and the State Council, or cabinet.
However, diplomats say the party -- and its individual leaders -- are the final arbiters of power, with the parliament allowed to exist as little more than window-dressing to try to persuade China's people that they too have a say in the decision-making process.
In terms of the structure and formation of China's central and regional parliaments, Qiao said the use of direct elections had been expanded since 1979, shortly after Deng Xiaoping consolidated power, to the county level from the lowest township level.
""Since 1995, elections of deputies to the people's congresses at township level have been held,"" he said.
""We have discovered that the people are very enthusiastic about these elections, and that more than 90 percent of the voters took part in the elections,"" he said.
However, Qiao dashed any expectations that the system of direct elections of deputies for congresses would be expanded soon above the county level.
""China has a vast territory and a large population and its economic and cultural development level is not high,"" Qiao said.
""Therefore, it conforms with our country's special conditions to elect deputies to the people's congresses directly only at the county and township levels for the present,"" he said.
Figures compiled by parliament show that in the last elections for township and county congresses, a total of 3.64 million delegates were chosen, many of them in contests where the number of candidates exceeded the number of seats.
Qiao acknowledged the limits to parliament's power, saying that many regional officials, who in China can run their district as virtual fiefdoms, ignore the law.
""There have even been cases in which law enforcement officials violate laws and some people override laws with their own opinions and power,"" Qiao said. ""We are now taking measures to tackle those problems."" He did not specify those measures.

49,"For 36 years Tibet's biggest leather factory gushed pollution into one of the world's cleanest rivers and haemorrhaged losses.
But help was at hand when Tibet's scenic beauty and devout Buddhist people enchanted visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1988.
German aid has since poured in, along with German technicians, transforming the plant into a rare model of environmental awareness on the roof of the world. It has also made its first net profit.
Manager Li Jishan glowed with pride as he described the modernisation wrought at his plant over the last few years.
""When I first came here in 1961 things were really backward. We lived in tents. Can you imagine?"" he said in an interview with Reuters.
The leather factory was moved to Lhasa in 1959 from Golmud in neighbouring Qinghai province to provide footleather for thousands of soldiers sent to garrison Tibet after an abortive uprising by Tibetans seeking independence in 1958.
As a state-owned firm that processes yak skins into shoes and handbags it had little incentive to turn a profit. That is slowly changing.
Last year, the China-Germany Joint Venture Lhasa Leather Factory of Tibet reported a profit of 200,000 yuan ($24,000) -- a modest sum but the first in its history.
""We have a good future, our efficiency is good...and with German assistance we are placing great emphasis on environmental protection,"" said Li, adding that he expected another profit this year.
""The German side is very strict, especially on environmental protection,"" he noted. ""But we get along with them very well.""
One problem identified by the German side is one common to most of China's state-owned firms -- the huge surplus labour that is the legacy of jobs-for-life socialism.
""We have had arguments with the German experts who want to fire someone, for example,"" said Li. ""But they have come to understand our point of view and our system.""
However, German officials still warn that keeping on a couple of hundred extra staff is bound to affect profits.
German officials said the plant had been an environmental disaster when they arrived, with its tannery spouting stinking waste into the nearby rushing Tolungchu river.
""It was in really bad shape with terrible environmental problems,"" said Niels von Keyserlingk, director of the office of the German Development Corporation in Beijing that oversees aid to the plant.
""Before, the water was untreated and flowed into the river causing many problems,"" he said. ""But things have been very nicely done. There is no pollution.""
All chemicals are recycled now and a German-manufactured system cleans the water, separating waste that is dried for use by local farmers as fertiliser.
""The water that flows into the river is absolutely clean,"" said von Keyserlingk, who visited the plant last May.
A cement factory on the opposite bank belching dust into the clear mountain area could pose a new environmental hazard.
Germany has given 15 million deutschemarks ($9.8 million) in aid to the plant, which has been allowed to register as a joint venture and thus qualifies for the generous tax breaks and holidays that Tibet offers to foreign investors.
German money has helped to buy the latest in leather processing machinery as well as sewing machines, waste elimination plants and even new solar energy panels that are heating water for the factory.
Sales have soared. The factory held an eight percent share of the Tibet shoe market for years, but in 1994 that jumped to 20 percent and nearly doubled again in 1995 to a 36 percent market share.
""Our products are really popular because they are all leather, and people want that kind of quality,"" Li said.
The factory is trying to boost sales to the rest of China as well as overseas exports, particularly to neighbouring Nepal.
But it faces awesome transport handicaps in shipping goods from a city that has no rail links and must send merchandise more than 1,000 km (600 miles) over some of China's most difficult roads to the nearest railway station.
""We still need to raise quality and produce more different styles of shoes to compete in the market,"" said Li, who has clearly picked up some tips from his German market-savvy experts.
""Either you learn to swim in the market or you drown.""

43,"Major retailers reported mixed results Thursday for the crucial holiday sales season, sparking a drop in their stocks on Wall Street.
The preliminary holiday reports by J.C. Penney Co. Inc., Dayton Hudson Corp., Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. and others are ""further confirmation that the holiday was one of moderate growth,"" Morgan Stanley retailing analyst Bruce Missett said.
""There's a lot of nervousness about retailers and what they're going to report. It's definitely taking a toll on the stocks,"" said UBS Securities retailing analyst Annie Erner.
J.C. Penney said sales for the four weeks ended Dec. 28 were close to the Plano, Texas-based company's goals but that markdowns were higher than expected.
Total sales, including drug store sales, for the period were $3.6 billion, a 23.2 percent increase from the $2.9 billion in sales for the comparable period in 1995.
Same-store sales at J.C. Penney, not including drug stores, for the holiday period increased 6.2 percent over 1995. The company did not release dollar figures for same-store sales, which cover stores open at least a year.
The company also said it expected fourth-quarter earnings before charges would not meet Wall Street expectations and that profit margins for November and December were below planned levels.
J.C. Penney stock dropped $1.25 to $47.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Dayton Hudson said same-store sales at its 65 department stores in the Midwest, 736 Target discount stores nationwide and 300 Mervyn's discount stores in the West and South were up 4.2 percent for the same period. The Minneapolis-based company did not give dollar figures.
""Results at Target and Mervyn's for the four weeks were on plan, while department stores sales were below our expectations,"" Chief Executive Bob Ulrich said in a statement. ""With the shorter selling season this year, we planned our sales conservatively and generally met our plans for the season.""
Dayton Hudson department store sales increased 0.3 percent, Mervyn's sales decreased 4.1 percent and Target sales rose 7.1 percent, the company said.
Dayton Hudson stock fell $1.375 to $37.875 on the NYSE.
Carson Pirie reported a 12.8 percent increase in sales to $194.1 million for the four-week period. Same-store sales rose 7.6 percent.
""The sales results during the 1996 holiday season were in line with my expectations,"" Chairman Stanton Bluestone said in a statement.
But the Milwaukee-based company, which operates 53 department stores and four furniture stores, said it expected five-week sales results for fiscal December will fall slightly below those for the five-week period ended Dec. 30, 1995.
Carson Pirie and Dayton Hudson expect to report five-week results next week.
Last Friday, Seattle-based Nordstrom Inc. warned that holiday sales would decline from year-ago levels and that earnings would be below Wall Street estimates.
The reports put retail analysts on edge, but they remained confident that other big names, such as Chicago's Sears Roebuck and Co., May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis, and Federated Department Stores, of Cincinnati, would meet or exceed expectations.
""My impression is that May did okay. Federated looks like they're on plan and for Sears, we're looking for a good fourth quarter,"" said Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Joseph Ronning.
A big factor in the mixed sales performance for the holiday season was the fact that it was five days shorter than the previous year since the Thanksgiving holiday was later.
""None of us knew what this five fewer days would do ... to the mechanics of the season,"" said Morgan Stanley's Missett.
The net result was that most big sales gains were restricted by the shortened season, while mediocre showings were made worse by it, analysts said.
""You came out with a trend line not dissimilar to what we've seen all year, which is modest growth,"" Missett said.
Carson Pirie's stock dropped 25 cents to $25 on the NYSE. Among other retailers, Sears dropped $1.25 to $44.75 and May fell $1.25 to $45.50, both on the NYSE.

43,"General Instrument Corp is setting goals for NextLevel Systems Inc -- the lead business to come out of a three-way corporate break-up -- of 35-45 percent annual operating income growth and 22-25 percent annual sales growth on operating margins of 10-12 percent.
Those growth rates could be even higher this year, General Instrument chief executive Richard Friedland said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, adding he sees stock price gains ahead for all three firms being formed in the break-up -- NextLevel, CommScope Inc and General Semiconductor Inc.
""I'd look to CommScope and General Semiconductor to increase at above-average rates in the eight to 10 percent return range, maybe more. I see NextLevel Systems doubling over the next year to 18 months,"" Friedland said.
Shares in General Instrument were up 1/4 to 22-7/8 Tuesday after the Chicago-based company announced a three-way split designed primarily to unlock the share value of NextLevel.
For CommScope, to be built on the world's largest coaxial cable business, Friedland said management's goals are 18 to 20 percent annual sales growth and 16 to 17 percent operating income growth with operating margins of 16 to 17 percent.
For General Semiconductor, to be formed from General Instrument's electronic component manufacturing operations, goals are 10 to 11 percent operating income growth on annual sales growth of 14-16 percent and operating margins of 20-21 percent, Friedland told analysts at a meeting Tuesday.
Under the plan, General Instrument shareholders will get one share in each of the new companies for each General Instrument share held, Friedland said.
""We may have to do a reverse split to comply with New York Stock Exchange rules,"" he said, adding closing of the transaction is seen by July.
No layoffs or hiring are planned. ""There are no staff actions contemplated as a result of the transaction,"" he said.
General Instrument has primary goals in the restructuring, Friedland said. One is to unlock the value of the businesses that will comprise NextLevel, which analysts said has been held back by General Instrument's other segments.
""Electronic conglomerates are not looked at very favorably these days,"" said Michael Geran, industry analyst at the Pershing Division of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
The other goal, Friedland said, has to do with General Instrument's heritage as part of the cable television industry -- a legacy that has overshadowed its newer technologies.
""We're going to continue to service the heck out of the cable base, but we're also getting into provision of dial tone and data. We need to break out of that mold General Instrument has been in of being a cable supplier,"" Friedland said.
He said the company decided to proceed with the break-up because it showed in 1996 that it could meet its business objectives, after failing to do so in years past. ""We've made that transition from development to deployment,"" he said.
Deprived of cash flows thrown off by the CommScope and General Semiconductors businesses, NextLevel will fund growth two ways. ""We do have a lot of visibility to cash flow in NextLevel Systems now that we have the products going out the door,"" he said. ""So we feel that, while NextLevel Systems may be slightly cash negative in '97, even our downside scenarios say we have more than adequate capabilities.""
In addition, he said, most of General Instrument's debt will be loaded onto CommScope and General Semiconductor, which can afford to service it. ""That leaves CommScope and General Semiconductor in fine shape in terms of their capital structure because they do generate the cash to pay this debt off in the near-term,"" he said.

43,"In a move that would reshape the medical device business, St. Jude Medical Inc. agreed Wednesday to make four strategic transactions that would lift it into the top ranks of manufacturers of devices for regulating heartbeat.
The $665 million package of interlocking deals is costly and poses some risks, but likely will proceed, analysts said.
The stock of St. Paul, Minn.-based St. Jude fell $1.25 to 37.375 after the announcement, while shares in other companies in the industry also fell.
The main thrust of St. Jude's moves was an agreement to buy Ventritex Inc. in a stock swap valued at $505 million.
Ventritex, of Sunnyvale, Calif., is the smallest of three companies that dominate the fast-growing, $500 million world market for implantable defibrillators, or ICDs -- electronic devices implanted in the chest and connected to the heart by wires to keep it from beating too rapidly.
""There's a small chance this won't go through, and the Street is also concerned about dilution. But I think this is perfect timing ... It's an idea whose time has come,"" said Montgomery Securities medical technology analyst Kurt Kruger.
To resolve some long-standing legal actions and help free Ventritex from cross-licensing restrictions that have hobbled it for years, St. Jude is making three smaller deals.
The company agreed to buy some assets from Telectronics Pacing Systems, a unit of Australia's Pacific Dunlop; to acquire Medtel, an Asia-Pacific medical goods distributor also tied to Pacific Dunlop; and to buy certain intellectual property rights from the Intermedics unit of SulzerMedica, owned by Swiss medical giant Sulzer AG.
""Part of the brilliance of this deal is bringing all these parties together,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Arch Smith.
St. Jude is the world's largest maker of heart valves, markets for which are growing, but slowly.
In search of growth and risk diversification, chief executive Ronald Matricaria engineered St. Jude's 1994 acquisition for $500 million of the Pacesetter Inc. unit of Germany's Siemens AG. The deal transformed St. Jude into a leading manufacturer of heart pacemakers.
Since then, rumours have swirled that St. Jude might acquire Ventritex -- a deal seen by many analysts as setting a capstone on Matricaria's efforts.
""If he pulls this off, it's the highlight of his career,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein.
Even with St. Jude's careful efforts, analysts said legal action could ensue. The other two main players in the ICD market -- Medtronic Inc. and Guidant Corp. -- could seize the chance to drag St. Jude into the courtroom.
Shares in Minneapolis-based Medtronic fell 12.5 cents to $64.125, while shares in Indianapolis-based Guidant dropped $2 to $41.50. Analysts said both fell on a perceived competitive threat from the St. Jude-Ventritex combination.
""Medtronic's world is getting more competitive, but I think they're less vulnerable than Guidant ... A hard rain is going to fall on Guidant,"" Kruger said.

43,"Approval of Eli Lilly &amp; Co's new anti-schizophrenia drug, Zyprexa, is expected to come soon from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, analysts said.
Marketing clearance for the drug, known generically as olanzapine, would put Lilly in the front of a parade of new anti-schizophrenia medications coming on the U.S. market.
""We expect approval yet this year ... There's been no hint of any issues"" from the FDA that might cause delay, said Lilly spokesman Edward West.
Wall Street analysts said approval could come this month.  
The FDA has not scheduled an advisory committee hearing for Zyprexa. West said Lilly has no indication that a committee hearing will be set. Analysts said the drug likely will be cleared without committee deliberations.
""The big expectation would be that Zyprexa will be approved ... That's what's on everybody's radar screen,"" said Smith Barney pharmaceuticals analyst Christina Heuer.
Zyprexa received a positive opinion in June from the European Union's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. European marketing approval likely will follow, analysts said.
Several competing products are in the pipeline.  
Close behind Lilly are Abbott Laboratories Inc with Serlect, Zeneca Group Plc with Seroquel and Pfizer Inc with Ziprasidone. All are expected to hit the market within the next 12 months.
Already on the market are Johnson &amp; Johnson's Risperdal, Sandoz AG's Clozaril and the benchmark treatment available since 1967, haloperidol, as well as a host of less frequently prescribed drugs.
Studies have shown that one in 100 people is schizophrenic. Estimates of the annual U.S. market for treating the disease range from $1 billion to $4.5 billion.
Looking at the huge success of Lilly's Prozac in treating clinical depression, drugmakers are hoping to score equally impressive wins with the new anti-schizophrenics.

43,"Aon Corp's acquisition of Alexander &amp; Alexander Services Inc looks like a good deal for both insurance giants and an even better one for American International Group Inc.
Aon will pay an aggregate of $1.23 billion for Alexander &amp; Alexander -- a price called reasonable by industry analysts.
Included in that amount is $317.5 million in cash for Alexander &amp; Alexander's Series B preferred shares, which AIG bought for $200 million in June 1994. ""AIG made out pretty good on this,"" said Conning &amp; Co analyst Gary Ransom.  
An AIG spokesman declined to comment on the transaction.
Analysts had long expected Aon to make a major buy. Its purchase this fall for $250 million of Inchcape Plc's Bain Hogg Group unit, a third the size of Alexander &amp; Alexander, did not convince most analysts that Aon was through expending its $1 billion cash warchest. ""Virtually everyone who watches the insurance industry has been expecting this deal,"" Robinson Humphrey analyst Thomas Rosencrants said.
""It's good for Aon. It's good for Alex, too. It gives them something better than what they had. Their (Alexander's) stock price looked like it was going to keep going down,"" Ransom said.  
Aon chief executive Patrick Ryan is expected to head up the combined operation, with Alexander &amp; Alexander chief executive Frank Zorb expected eventually to step aside.
""I would not be surprised to see Frank take a consulting role. I would not expect him to be involved to a great extent following the merger,"" Rosencrants said.
In an interview with Reuters, Ryan said Aon was attracted to the strategic fit offered by Alexander &amp; Alexander.
""They've got a great international business. They've got a wonderful consulting business that fits with ours. And they're strong in Canada, where we are quite small,"" Ryan said.  
Over the past decade, the insurance industry has become increasingly competitive and insurers have had to hold down premium increases. Profit margins have suffered in the process and industry consolidation has accelerated.
""There's no end in sight to the 10-year soft market,"" Rosencrants said. ""A&amp;A has been struggling for 15 years ... Their only realistic alternative would have been to sell to Marsh &amp; McLennan (Cos Inc). But they've been such close competitors over the years that there could have been some cultural problems there.""
Aon shares were up 1-1/4 to 58-7/8, Alexander &amp; Alexander was up 3 to 17-1/8, and AIG was off 2 to 109-5/8.

43,"Eli Lilly &amp; Co expects marketing and administration costs in the fourth quarter to be only slightly up or flat versus the year-ago level, marking a slowdown from a third-quarter jump of 6.5 percent.
The line item ""may be up a couple percent, but certainly below the growth rates we showed in the third quarter,"" Lilly chief financial officer Charles Golden said in an interview.
Lilly's gross profit margin declined again in the third quarter, partly due to increased marketing costs for launching new products, such as the anti-schizophrenia drug Zyprexa.  
Zyprexa is one of a handful of new, higher-margin products that will begin to lift sales in the fourth quarter, but a margin trend turnaround is likely further off, Golden said.
""I think it's going to be sometime next year. I'm not sure it's in the next quarter,"" Golden said of improved margins.
Gross margin has declined for two consecutive quarters.
Other than that, analysts greeted Lilly's third-quarter results with a positive tone.
""I didn't see any real big surprises in these numbers,"" said NatWest Securities drug industry analyst John Lamberton.  
Lilly's third-quarter operating profits of $0.64 per share, versus $0.54 per share in 1995, were precisely in line with Wall Street expectations, said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Mariola Haggar.
The company said an 11-percent sales gain was led by the anti-depressant Prozac, the human insulin Humulin and increased revenues from the PCS Health Systems unit.
Shares in Lilly were up 1/2 to 69-1/4 on Tuesday after the Indianapolis-based drugmaker reported an 18-percent gain in third-quarter earnings over the year-ago period.  
In the fourth quarter, Golden said, Lilly will likely lose a small benefit to earnings per share stemming from a decline in outstanding shares versus the prior year. That benefit, caused by the split-off of Guidant Corp last year, boosted third-quarter earnings by five percent.
""We will lose that in the fourth quarter ... You're talking a penny or two per share,"" he said.
In the fourth quarter, the company will also lose a small boost to earnings from a lower tax rate that lifted third-quarter earnings slightly compared with the prior year.

In an interview with Reuters, Geoffrey Meyers said Health Care recorded earnings growth of more than 20 percent in every quarter since the company went public in 1991.  
""The $1.47 is 19 percent growth for this year. And 18 to 20 percent for the year after is something we've been giving guidance on,"" Meyers said.

""Our underlying growth rate in revenues is about 10 percent. We made an acquisition this year of a company called Milestone that will add another three, four percent. So we're up somewhere in the mid-teens this year in our revenue growth,"" he said.  
Regarding Wall Street speculation that Health Care &amp; Retirement may join in the merger wave sweeping through the nursing home and sub-acute care industry, Meyers said, ""We certainly have the financial capability to do a large deal.""

43,"Quaker Oats Co. conceded defeat Thursday in efforts to turn around its struggling Snapple beverage unit and agreed to sell it for $300 million -- $1.4 billion less than it paid for the business -- to Triarc Cos. Inc., the owner of rival Mistic beverages.
The selling price -- far below the $1.7 billion Quaker paid for the premium beverage company in 1994 -- disappointed Wall Street, but analysts said they were pleased that Quaker did the deal.
""It was a fire sale price ... The bad news is the investment has been a disaster, the good news is they're trying to put it behind them,"" said John McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential Securities, a brokerage and investment bank.
Snapple's ready-to-drink teas and juices virtually invented the premium soft drink market and remain a leader, with more than $500 million in 1996 sales. But Snapple has lost money ever since Chicago-based Quaker -- better known for its breakfast cereals and Gatorade sports drinks -- bought it.
Snapple sales fell 8 percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, the company reported last month.
""The decision to sell Snapple was reached after an extensive review of various shareholder value-building options by management,"" said Quaker Chairman William Smithburg in a statement.
""After reviewing all possible options, we decided it was in the shareholders' interest to remove the financial burdens and risks Snapple brought to the portfolio and better focus on our value-driving businesses,"" Smithburg said.
New York-based Triarc, the buyer, owns the Mistic drinks business, a Snapple rival. It also owns Royal Crown soft drinks, Arby's Inc. fast-food restaurants and other businesses.
""With respect to Triarc, this transaction is very positive ... it is complementary to Triarc's existing position in Mistic, which is fruit juices, while Snapple is mostly teas,"" said Michael Branca, a food industry analyst at Lehman Brothers, a brokerage and investment bank.
""In addition, Triarc's beverage management is highly respected in the beverage distribution business ... Snapple could well be reborn under Triarc,"" Branca said.
Following announcement of the deal, Quaker's stock rose 87.5 cents to $38.375 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Triarc rose $1.50 to $17.25.
Quaker said it would take a non-cash pretax charge of about $1.4 billion, or $8.40 a share, in its first quarter, to record the loss on the sale.
The company also said it would be able to recoup about $250 million in taxes paid on previous capital gains, ""making the cash value of the transaction approximately $550 million.""
A Quaker spokesman said the tax consideration was a key part of the company's decision to sell Snapple to Triarc now.
The spokesman added that Triarc, which could not immediately be reached, has indicated it intends to transfer virtually all Snapple employees with the business.
Triarc said in a statement it expected to close the deal by the end of June, subject to customary conditions, including government antitrust clearance.
Besides Snapple, Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life.
""Quaker still has the crown jewels -- Gatorade and the cereals -- and performance in those businesses has been pretty good,"" said food industry analyst George Staphos of the investment bank and brokerage of PaineWebber.
Quaker said that as a result of the sale, its earnings -- excluding the one-time loss -- were expected to increase by about 10 cents a share in 1997 as debt is reduced and Snapple losses removed.
For all of 1996, Quaker earned $248 million, or $1.80 a share, on revenues of $5.2 billion.
""The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back,"" said John O'Neil, food industry analyst at BT Securities.

43,"Troubled auto lender Mercury Finance Co. said Thursday it won an extension of its short-term credit line with Bank of America, but analysts said permanent refinancing remains Mercury's most critical need.
""The trick will be to get some permanent financing in place and then get the thing up and running again,"" said James Inglis, financial services analyst at Philo Smith &amp; Co.
Extension of the $50 million, short-term loan is still a major advance, said Mercury Chief Executive William Brandt.
Mercury's creditors granted waivers allowing extension of its credit line with Bank of America to June 10. The waivers permit Mercury to continue to pledge assets as collateral on the $50 million credit facility. The previous waiver period had been for only 30 days, Chicago-based Mercury said.
""This 90 day extension is a tangible demonstration of confidence in Mercury,"" Brandt said in a statement. ""The expanded waiver period gives the company breathing room to focus on operations and on the exploration of long-term financing alternatives.""
The company said it is talking with holders of $22 million of subordinated debt about their interest payments.
Mercury faces a federal investigation and several shareholder lawsuits after its January announcement that it had to restate financial results to show lower profits due to accounting irregularities.
The company lost more than $2 billion in market capitalisation after its stock price plunged on the news of the restatement. The stock fell in January from $14 to less than $2 per share. It rose 25 cents to $2.875 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Under the terms of the waivers, during the 90-day period, Mercury will resume interest payments on nearly all of its roughly $1 billion in debt and will pay any past-due interest.
Mercury received the $50 million in short-term financing from Bank of America a month ago. It is being used to meet daily operating expenses and interest payments.
The 90-day extension is ""certainly a good sign,"" said Katrina Blecher, financial analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co. ""I don't think it was unexpected,"" she said. ""But they have to get permanent financing. My gut says they'll probably be able to do it. I would certainly would not write the company off.""

A spokesman for St. Jude, of St. Paul, Minn., said the company planned to take a closer look at the deal because of the three deaths believed to be associated with Ventritex devices.
""Based on what we know today, we are moving forward"" with the acquisition, said St. Jude spokesman Peter Gove. ""But we are going to do, as you might expect, additional due diligence ... With a product quality issue like this, obviously it causes additional analysis to be done.""
Ventritex general counsel Mark Meltzer said a patient implanted with a Ventritex implantable defibrillator died on Jan. 22. He said the company was notified a day or two later and it promptly advised the FDA and St. Jude.
The identity of the patient is not being disclosed.
On Jan. 16, Ventritex said it had been authorised by the FDA to begin reprogramming 5,605 implantable defibrillators in patients. The company said then that component failures in the devices were believed to be associated with the deaths of two patients.
An implantable defibrillator, or ICD, is a device about the size of a pocket pager that is implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart by internal wires. Like a pacemaker, the ICD regularly sends small electrical shocks to the heart. But where a pacemaker keeps the heart from slowing down, an ICD keeps it from beating too rapidly.
Meltzer said substantial progress has been made in Ventritex's efforts to find the patients who carry the 5,605 implantable defibrillators that need to be reprogrammed. He said he was unaware of any change in the St. Jude deal.

15,"Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd reported on Wednesday a 50 percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half and said it expected to make the appointment of its new chief executive officer (CEO) soon.
David Jones, which is currently without a chief following the resignation of Chris Tideman on Monday, reported a net profit of A$22.34 million in the 26 weeks ended January 25, compared with a net profit of A$44.64 million a year ago.
The retailer also said the 1996/97 year net profit would be lower than the previous year.  
Chairman Richard Warburton said the retailer would also review five or six of its underperperforming stores, but would not say if that meant store closures, but added that David Jones was also committed to its store expansion programme.
Tideman, who joined the company in 1994, made a surprise resignation on Monday, citing personal reasons.
Responding to reports that there was shareholder pressure on Tideman to resign, Warburton said Tideman left of his own will and that there was no pressure from the board or shareholders.  
Tideman oversaw the refloat of David Jones in November 1995 from the corporate remains of the debt-laden Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd, which cash-starved David Jones for most of the latter part of its 15-year ownership tenure.
""We expect to make an annoucement within days, not weeks,"" Warburton said about the chief executive appointment.
Warburton said the half year results were helped by a good January, but described the result as ""disappointing.""
""February saw a bit of a correction from the January upturn, but we have seen a slight increase in March,"" Warburton said.  
""Over the balance of the year, the company will continue to focus on implementing initiatives in product, consumer service and systems,"" the company said in the results statement.
""However, at this stage it is anticipated that the profit before tax level in the second half will be below the same period last year,"" the company said.
David Jones warned in early January that its first half profit would be up to 50 percent below forecast due to a lacklustre retail trading environment.  
Warburton said today the company did not expect any material improvement in retail trading conditions in the second half, adding that three reductions in official interest rates in 1996 had yet to filter through to the retailing sector.
Finance director Robert Wright said today David Jones' 1996/97 profit would be within analysts forecasts of between A$32 million and A$37 million.
David Jones sales fell one percent to A$782.58 million in the 1996/97 first half.  
Warburton said the retailer would review about five or six of its 30 stores department stores which were underperforming and not returing any shareholder vale.
He said about one-third of David Jones stores were performing very well, another third were making a profit, but could be improved, while the final third were underperforming and not returning any shareholder value.
""You have got a final third that's just not producing shareholder value. They are not necessarily losing money but they are not increasing shareholder value,"" he said.  
""Out of that third a half, I believe, with a bit of hard work and creative juices could take them above the line, the other half we have to look at very, very closely.""
""So you can see we have about five or six stores to look at, that does not necessarily mean closure. It may mean you have to look at different things to do with those stores,"" he said.
At 2.50 p.m. (0350 GMT), David Jones shares were two cents lower at A$1.72 with 487,292 shares traded.

15,"Australian television broadcaster Seven Network Ltd said on Monday the advertising market was fairly ""tough"" but the group was meeting its budget targets.
""It's a fairly tough market but we are going all right. We are on track for our budgets,"" Seven managing director Gary Rice told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Seven, which is 15 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, reported a jump in net profit to A$115.13 million in the year to June 30 from A$41.26 million in 1994/95.
Last year's result was hit by an advertising rate bungle.  
Rice described the 1995/96 year result as ""satisfactory"". But Rice said it was too earlier to forecast earnings for 1996/97. He said there was unlikely to be much of an impact from its Australian broadcast rights to the Atlanta Olympics in July.
""There is no short term gain or advertising dollars from an event like the Olympics,"" Rice said.
Seven has focussed on building up its news and current affairs programming over the past year, which should increase costs, but also increase revenue.
""I have said that would have a net impact on costs,"" he said.  
Asked if the costs associated with the news and current affairs programming initiatives had cut into margins, Rice repiled: ""Not substantially, because it has also had a revenue benefit.""
Seven, which is also 20 percent owned by its chairman Kerry Stokes, reported a 15.2 percent rise in sales to A$671.15 million in 1995/96.
In July, Seven teamed up, in a surprise move, with United States billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian to back a management buyout of Hollywood film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc (MGM) for US$1.3 billion from French bank Credit Lyonnais.  
Rice said there would be nothing in the short term coming out from Seven's link to MGM, but in a few years there may be some joint efforts. ""I think you will see down the track some joint promotion and the marketing of certain things.""
""There will probably minimal returns out of MGM in the short term, but it is not a major cost in terms of potential payback,"" Rice said.
""Hopefully from a shareholder point of view, you will see some benefits flowing to Seven as we go down the track. We are looking at three or four years before we get maximum benefit from MGM,"" he said.  
Rice said the company had made not a decision yet about exercising its option in Optus Vision, which would increase its stake in the pay television and telephony group to 15 percent from two percent.
""We don't have a view one way or the other, we don't have to make a decision until then, we don't have enough information at the moment,"" Rice said.
Seven shares closed six cents lower at A$3.75 on low volume.

15,"U.S.-owned express freight carrier United Parcel Service (UPS) could start flying its own planes to Australia if growth in the Australian market continued at the current rate, a senior company official said on Friday.
UPS, which started serving Australia in 1991, currently uses commercial airlines to carry packages in and out of the country, UPS general manager Australia Terry Hales said in an interview.
""If things continue the way they are I could see very quickly the realisation of that ..."", Hales said.
""It is certainly not beyond the terms of possibility at all. I would say that we have a plan that it would happen in the next five years,"" he said.
UPS does not use its own planes, which currently total 300 worldwide, to fly to Australia as there was not enough export business from Australia, he said.
""We don't fly planes into Australia. The market is not yet large enough to warrant bringing in an airplane every day full up and then turn them around and fly them back,"" Hales said.
""We have no problems filling them up coming in. Going out is another matter on a regular basis,"" he said.
Hales said Australia imports four times as much air freight as it exports. However, he said UPS projects large export growth, albeit from a low base in Australia.
""Our volume of revenue forecasts are in the region of 34 percent (growth) in calendar 1997,"" he said.
The import business is seen growing at a more modest pace.
""We still feel fairly bullish that we will still grow in the (import) market, probably seven or eight percent which is reasonable for the business,"" he said.
UPS uses Australia as a service centre rather than a hub for the Asia Pacific. Hales said UPS was spending US$400 million on its Asia Pacific hub terminal in Taiwan, which was chosen due to its proximity to other Asian nations and the United States.
""When you sit down and work out the best location to service the customers, in our case we came out with Taiwan as the best location for the Asia Pacific,"" Hales said.
However, he did not rule out Australia becoming an Asian Pacific hub in the future.
UPS currently uses Honolulu as a connection point for freight bound for Australia.
Cargo is transferred to a Qantas Airways Ltd flight to carry it the rest of the way to Australia.
But this could change in the future if growth continued at the current pace, Hales said.
Atlanta-based UPS is privately owned.

15,"Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday it wanted to grab a slice of the lucrative Asian high-roller market but first had to win a tax break from the state government.
The company holds a 12-year licence to operate the only legal casino in Australia's largest city but has battled with the New South Wales (NSW) government for the past 15 months to receive the same tax concession that its interstate rivals have.
""I am hopeful, but I can't say anything concrete at this stage,"" chief executive officer Neil Gamble told Reuters in an interview. The Sydney casino is 26.3 percent owned by U.S. casino operator Showboat Inc.
(Corrects to add Gamble's first name and title)
Without the 10 percent tax concession on winnings made by the high-rollers, the Sydney casino could only watch as rich Asian customers headed to casinos in Melbourne, Perth and on the Gold Coast, Gamble said.
""As far as the high-rollers are concerned it makes us totally uncompetitive."" Gamble said the high-rollers also required other incentives to be lured to Sydney.
""The professional gamblers would have about A$100,000 (US$80,000) to spend on a weekend, some would go up to A$2 million or A$3 million, some go up to tens of millions of dollars, but that is rare.""
If the Sydney casino could have its big gamblers tax reduced from more than 27 percent at the moment, it would then open a network of marketing offices around Asia, he said, adding to its representation in Hong Kong and Singapore.
So far its revenue from high rollers is negligible as 90 percent of the 12,000 people that visit the casino daily are considered locals.
The Sydney casino currently operates out of temporary premises but plans to open a A$1 billion permanent casino late next year, with 1,500 gaming machines and 200 gaming tables, a hotel and two theatres.
The casino has posted a string of disappointing results since it opened its doors in September 1995, with Gamble largely attributing this to over-optimistic forecasts in the prospectus.
""I think the prospectus forecast was too bullish,"" Gamble said ""I don't think that was a failure of mangement to achieve I think it was an over estimate of reality by any comparsion with other parts of this industry.""
The casino floated on the local bourse in June 1995 and forecast an operating profit after tax of A$37 million for the 1995/96 year. It reported an actual net loss of A$4.68 million in the financial year to June 30, 1996.
The recent sell down by international financier and founding shareholder George Soros was not a vote of no-confidence in the group, Gamble said. Soros now has under five percent down from 9.8 percent at the time of the float.
Since Soros sold down his stake in mid-November, Sydney casino shares have fallen eight percent. Sydney Harbour Casino shares closed steady at A$1.78 on Tuesday.

15,"Australian oil and gas companies are being snapped up by foreign companies with an eye for undervalued stocks, but analysts said the sector faces a bright future with higher oil prices and a deregulated gas market.
During 1996, there has been about A$2.5 billion worth of takeovers announced in Australia's shrinking oil and gas sector and another A$600 million worth of asset sales as some non-oil and gas players quit the local oil and gas market.  
Analysts said local oil groups with low share prices and overseas assets have struck the eye of hungry foreign companies.
""Overseas people appreciate the value of oil and gas assets, particularly in southeast Asia, but I don't think the market is fully valuing these assets through the share prices,"" Timothy Savage, an oil and gas analyst at Hartley Poynton, told Reuters.
Mobil Corp's A$1.78 billion tilt for Ampolex Ltd in February was the largest bid made this year in the sector. British oil producers are also keen on local oil firms.  
Crusader Ltd was taken over mid-year by Clyde Petroleum Plc, while in the past month Premier Oil Plc has made a bid for Discovery Petroleum NL and Cairn Energy Plc has made a offer for Command Petroleum Ltd.
BT Securities oil and gas analyst Stuart Baker said most of the Australian oil groups that have attracted predator attention have been producers with oil assets offshore.
""It is no coincidence at all that the companies that have disappeared have been always companies that have endeavoured to build an overseas presence, and they have all without exception been taken over,"" Baker told Reuters.  
Analysts said the rise in the oil price this year had not been a reason for the corporate activity. NYMEX oil futures prices have risen almost 50 percent over the past five months to current levels of about US$25.50 a barrel.
""Takeovers have been a feature of this sector for years and it doesn't seem to matter if the oil price is up or down,"" Baker said.
Baker said oil companies making the bids have a double positive effect from the oil price rise with increased cash flow and a boost in share prices making it easier for companies to raise equity and debt.
Analysts said rationalisation might continue in the sector for some time, but most of the short-term activity had occured.
""I think it is possibly going to clam down now,"" one Sydney-based oil analyst said.
Analysts said remaining potential targets in the oil and gas sector were Cultus Petroleum Ltd and Petroz NL, which have assets in the prospective Timor Sea area.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Santos Ltd were unlikely bid targets, analysts said. Woodside, which accounts for nearly 50 percent of the A$12 billion sector, is controlled by oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
Santos is seen to have a restrictive share ownership structure making it difficult for takeovers, analysts said.
Santos has also been keen on purchases, buying A$250 million worth of oil assets this year from groups quitting the sector.
Analysts said the takeover activity has raised the focus on the sector, particularly in gas exploration and development.
They said reforms in the local gas industry has opened up opportunities for gas supplies to major mines in remote areas and the set up of co-generation projects around the country.
""There is a lot of money coming over here and finding their way into all sorts of corners of the industry. So it looks like it is going to be a fairly buoyant period again, irrespective of whether we have further takeovers ahead,"" Baker said.
Australia's oil and gas index hit a record high of 1459.5 on Tuesday, but fell slightly to close at 1432.9 on Wednesday.

15,"Australia's second largest telephone carrier Optus Communications rang up its first annual profit on Wednesday and is on track for its sharemarket float by the end of the year.
Optus, established at the start of 1992 to compete with Australia's main telephone carrier, state-owned Telstra Corp, reported a pre-tax profit of A$60.3 million (US$47.64 million) in the year to June 30, 1996.
This compares with a loss of A$17.0 million in 1994/95.
""After a tremendous effort during its first few years, Optus is now in a very strong position to capitalise on the many opportunities presented by the rapidly growing telecommunications industry,"" chief executive officer Zygmunt Switkowski said in a statement.
The profit was within expectations. Telecommunications analysts forecast Optus to deliver a profit before abnormals of between A$55 million and A$65 million.
""I don't think the market will be disappointed,"" said one Sydney-based analyst. ""I think the revenue is a little bit down on what they were talking about.""
The results reflected strong revenue growth of 36 percent to A$1.94 billion in 1995/96, with high revenue increases from its three main businesses of mobile telephones, long-distance calls and services to the corporate and government sector, chief operating officer Phil Jacobs said on Wednesday.
Optus, 24.5 percent owned each by U.S. BellSouth Corp and Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc, said in February it expected to achieve A$2.0 billion in revenue in 1995/96.
The Sydney-based group is still expected to make its sharemarket debut by the end of 1996, Switkowski said.
""The float's planned to occur this side of Christmas and the prospectus is progressing to plan, but it is not done,"" he told reporters after the results anouncement.
The float is expected to raise around A$1.5 billion, making it the largest telecommunications company to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, with up to 40 percent of the company shares to be listed.
Optus will later be joined by Telstra on the stock exchange.
The Australian government plans to raise A$8.0 billion from the sale of one-third of Telstra in 1997/98, which will be just after full deregulation of Australia's telecommunications industry on July 11, 1997.
Despite chalking up its first annual profit, Optus incurred increased losses from its 46.5 percent-owned pay television and local telephone call operator Optus Vision.
Optus said its share of losses from Optus Vision was A$74.0 million, which were mainly due to the start-up of the offshoot, which is spending A$3.0 billion rolling out its nationwide fibre optic cable network to provide pay TV and telephone services.
Optus Vision, which includes Australia's richest man Kerry Packer amongst its shareholders, reported a loss of A$1.54 million in 1994/95, in its first year of operation. The company has not announced its 1995/96 results.
Switkowski was coy about 1996/97 forecasts. Optus Communications was completing its prospectus for the sharemarket float, which would contain revenue and profit forecasts.
However, Switkowski predicted that revenue from its mobile telephone business would exceed revenues from its long-distance calls due to strong local demand, as Australia has one of the highest penetration rates for mobile phones in the world.

15,"St George Bank Ltd announced on Monday an agreed A$2.65 billion merger with Advance Bank Australia Ltd - its fifth merger attempt in the past two years.
The merger of the two Sydney-based regional banks would create Australia's fifth largest bank, with assets of A$40 billion and a market capitalisation of A$4.5 billion, making its of Australia's top 25 listed companies.  
Analysts said the plan for Advance to pay St George A$100 million if it were taken over by a third party was seen as a way to ward off other bids, making it look like it was fifth time lucky for the St George.
""I think that would make it unattractive for somebody else to come in and make a bid,"" said Linda Lyon, banking analyst at brokers BNP Equities.
St George said it would offer an effective A$7.30 for each share in Advance Bank.  
Advance shareholders would be offered a combination of A$2.10 in cash, a 20 cent special cash dividend and new St George shares up to a value of A$5.00 per Advance Bank.
St George said the total value of the offer was A$7.30 per share, representing a 20 percent increase over the average Advance Bank share price over the previous five trading days.
Advance shareholders will also receive Advance Bank's interim dividend, expected to be 20 cents, payable in February.
St George said it would also raise A$360 million in a new capital raising to help fund the bid. The issue would proceed upon completion of the acquisition, expected to in April.  
St George said the merger was driven by the need to lower costs and a review had found the merger could achieve a reduction of 15 percent in annual combined expenses or A$140 million before tax.
Advance shares soared over 10 percent on the announcement.
Analysts said that although there would be cost savings, the price was still fairly generous.
""My initial reaction is that it looks like Advance Bank shareholders are coming out of the deal quite well, whereas St George shareholders are coming out not so well,"" said one Sydney-based banking analyst.  
""It's a big price. I can't imagine anybody else coming and topping the price St George is offering,"" said BNP's Lyon.
Analysts said the offer valued Advance at 2.8 times net asset backing, well above the 2.0 times asset backing level at which recent Australian bank merger prices had been based.
St George has been desperate to have a friendly merger as it is seen as a takeover target itself.
Australia's largest banking group, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), holds a 6.8 percent stake in St George.
NAB has said it has no takeover plans for St George.  
Analysts said the Wallis inquiry into Australia's finance and banking sector might put NAB's acquisition plans on hold until the inquiry reported its findings in March.
St George's bid for Metway Bank Ltd earlier this year was scuttled by the Queensland government, which trumped its offer with a higher bid through its wholly-owned financial services group Suncorp and the Queensland Industry and Development Corp (QIDC). Last year, St George was foiled in its merger bid for Perth-based Challenge Bank Ltd when Westpac Banking Corp made a higher offer.  
St George was also in talks last year to merge with the Bank of Western Australia Ltd, before the Bank of Scotalnd Ltd took control, and the Bank of South Australia, which was takeover by Advance early 1995.
St George shares plunged after the announcement.
At 2.20 p.m. (0420 GMT) Advance Bank shares were 69 cents or 10.99 percent higher at A$6.97 while St George shares were 40 cents or 4.47 percent down at A$8.55.

Tenneco has announced a restructure that includes a proposed merger of its energy arm with El Paso Energy Corp
""But we haven't got a deal in front of us ... but I can tell you we have had more than one knock on our door and say 'if we could put something together would you be interested,' and we say 'come on back when you have got something',"" Bleasel said.  
""The whole Tenneco story is yet to unfold,"" Bleasel told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""There are a lot of rumours in the market that El Paso may not want to hold onto all of the assets,"" he said.
Bleasel said said AGL, a Australian gas utility and energy group, would wait and see what unfolds with the Tenneco-El Paso restructure, whether assets are sold off or not.
Tenneco's Australian assets include the 1700 km of pipeline in South Australia including the state's primary gas pipeline from Moomba to the Adelaide pipeline system. Tenneco is also building a 760 km gas pipeline in southwest Queensland.  
""I continuously say ... that AGL is interested in every sale whereever it is in the country because we are now a broad based energy company and if the Tenneco assets were to go to the market then we would be interested in how they were going to be presented to the market,"" Bleasel said.
""The silly thing to say is 'no we are not interested or no there is no possible sale,' then if somebody wants to do a little slick sale then they are not going to come and talk to you because you have said publicly you are not interested.""  
However, a Tenneco Australia spokeswoman said Tenneco had made no decision about the future of its Australian assets nor had it told anyone the assets were for sale.
AGL's main market is New South Wales but it has businesses in Victoria, Western Australia and the Nortern Territory.
The Sydney-based group also has interests in China, Poland and Chile. ""When you are trying to grow a company like we are, we are interested in everything,"" Bleasel said.  
Bleasel said he was very optimistic on the company's prospects from Monday's agreement with Santos Ltd and ALISE Energy Australia Pty Ltd for the supply of gas to a proposed cogeneration plant at Botany in Sydney.
""This gives a new revenue stream to AGL,"" Bleasel said.
He said 20-year agreement would not affect the company bottom line until the project is up and running in about two years time.  
AGL earlier held its annual meeting where the former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia John Phillips was formally appointed the company's new chairman, replacing Richard Mason who retired.
Shareholders also approved the appointments of Charles Allen, the former managing director of Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Carolyn Hewson, a director of CSR Ltd and wife of former Australian liberal party leader John Hewson.

15,"The Asia-Pacific region should work towards lowering telephone charges to stimulate usage and promote economic growth, Australian Telecommunications Minister Richard Alston said on Thursday.
""An important emphasis of our work must be to ensure that users benefit from progress being made in telecommunications,"" Alston told the second Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) telecommunications ministers meeting.
""At the most basic level this means providing access to people who have lacked it, by extending the reach of networks and by lowering prices to ensure that genuine access is available to all our people,"" Alston said.
""Our experience is that real cost reductions are possible, but they are less likely to be achieved under monopoly arrangements,"" he said.
Alston cited Australia's example. In June, privately owned telecommunications and pay television group Optus Vision started to offer local telephone calls at 20 cents per call, which was 25 percent cheaper than that charged by state-owned Telstra.
Australia's six-month-old conservative government plans to sell one-third of Telstra in the 1997/98 financial year to June.
The three-day APEC ministers meeting aims to co-ordinate a regional telecommunications policy, also known as Asia-Pacific Information Infrastructure (APII).
""The development of the APII will encourage business activity and growth in the region. It will increase the investment funds available for the provision, expansion and modernisation of telecommunications networks,"" Alston said.
Alston, who is hosting the APEC meeting, said lower prices for telecommunications services, telephones, on-line and interactive services would stimulate economic activity.
""It remains a paramount objective of APEC to ensure that these trade and investment flows are able to occur by removing barriers through liberalising reforms,"" he said.
A more sophisticated telecommunications infrastruture in the Asia-Pacific region would result in the provision of more services and employment opportunities, Alston said.
""Consumers and businessess, both large and small, will benefit from increased activity in information services with lower prices and the availbility of a greater range of services,"" Alston said.

15,"Australian Internet service provider OzEmail Ltd on Thursday launched long-distance telephone calls over the Internet at a quarter the cost charged by existing Australian phone companies Telstra Corp and Optus.
OzEmail, which is based in Sydney but listed on the technology-heavy NASDAQ market in the United States, said users do not need a personal computer for the new service. A call can be made from any telephone by dialling a number which then connects the call to the Internet and the destination.
The new service, called a world first by OzEmail, was launched with former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating making the first call to Mark Roberts, telecommunications analyst at Montgomery Securities in the United States.
""Today, I am pleased to launch what I am confident will become one of the major means by which we will communicate with the rest of the world,"" Keating told reporters at the launch.
Keating described the call's quality as being equal to or better than a call on a cellular phone. Under OzEmail's new service, calls to the U.S. and Britain would cost A$21 (US$27) per hour compared with about A$77 charged by Telstra and Optus.
""Calls over the Internet are less expensive because of the superior bandwidth utilisation of the Internet as compared to the traditional technology employed by telephone companies,"" OzEmail chief executive Sean Howard told reporters.
The service would initially be exclusive to OzEmail's 100,000-plus Internet customers, who would only be able to place long-distance calls within Australia and to New Zealand, the United States and Britain in the early stages, Howard said.
After two months the service would be made available to the public with the residential market targeted first, Howard said. The reach of its calls will then be expanded to Japan, Hong Kong and Italy, with Taiwan and another Asian country a possibility.
Calls can only be made from Australia or by Australians travelling overseas, as regulations prevented OzEmail from providing the service to citizens of other countries.
Keating said: ""It opens up a new market, particularly for low-income families that were previously excluded from the long-distance market because of the high cost.""
Under Keating's term as prime minister, which ended in March 1996, Australia started deregulating its telecommunications industry, which will become fully deregulated on July 1, 1997.
The current coalition government of Prime Minister John Howard is also planning to sell a third of state-owned Telstra, which could raise an estimated A$8.0 billion (US$6.2 billion).
Any valuation on Telstra could be affected by the impact of cheaper telephone calls over the Internet, Keating said.
""This might even lower the valuation of Telstra, but I don't have to worry about that anymore,"" a smiling Keating said.
Australian telecommunications analysts agreed that cheaper telephone service via the Internet would be a threat to both Telstra and Optus, which also plans a share-market float.
""Local telephony over the Internet has been a threat to the carrier market for some time and that is why Telstra and Optus are trying to get involved in the Internet and carry more Internet traffic,"" one Sydney-based telecoms analyst said.
""I don't think they (Telstra and Optus) will be encouraging local calls over the Internet,"" the analyst said.

47,"Shares in British supermarkets fell on Monday after a study said they were closer to a price war than they have been for 15 years.
But analysts remain sceptical that stores will risk such a move, and supermarkets themselves appeared reluctant to sacrifice their profit margins.
The study by research group Verdict adding to market worries after J. Sainsbury Plc, now replaced as Britain's favourite supermarket chain by Tesco Plc, warned last Friday that its profits would be hit by efforts to boost sales.
Verdict said in a report prepared before Sainsbury's warning that profits would be 50 million pounds ($81.2 million) below expectations that risks of a price war were greater than at any time since 1982.
Verdict analyst Clive Vaughan said Sainsbury's comments increased the probability to ""closer to 50 percent.""
But Sainsbury ""is not planning to start a price war,"" a spokeswoman for the company said, adding that ""we are already very competitive.""
Market leader Tesco ""continues to offer unbeatable value,"" the campaign which it launched in September 1996, a Tesco spokesman said.
Analysts said the big four supermarkets, which also include Safeway and ASDA, were unlikely to want to risk the damage to margins which cutting prices would entail.
""A price war remains on the horizon rather than imminent,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Sainsbury is struggling to gain the initiative snatched by arch-rival Tesco which leapt into the market lead just over a year ago and is seeing sales growth of 7.5 percent.
Sainsbury's sales were up 4.4 percent over the key Christmas trading period, an improvement over three percent gains seen in October 1996 but still not enough to threaten Tesco.
Shares in the company, which is 40 percent owned by the Sainsbury family, fell 10 pence on Monday to trade at 331 pence after plunging more than 10 percent on Friday.
Tesco saw its shares slip 5-1/2 to 354-1/2 pence while Safeway, the fourth largest store group, was down 12 pence at 377 pence and ASDA, which prides itself on being the cheapest of the big four, eased 1-1/2 to 120 pence.
""The market is right to mark shares down as a precaution...(but) no-one would ever dream"" of launching a full-scale price war, said Nick Bubb of Mees Pierson.
British supermarkets generally obtain gross margins of 20-26 percent, analysts said, giving them flexibility to battle on price but with the leading four holding a majority of the market, there is little inclination to give up healthy profits.
""The supermarkets are in a state of relative equilibrium and Sainsbury is the last one to offer more margin at this stage,"" said the analyst.
Tesco is in a stronger position ""and could be tempted to enforce that,"" he added, but suggested any move would fall short of a full price war where retailers might make hefty cuts on several thousand items, costing a couple of points on margins.
""Tesco might be tempted to stick the boot in, but...the more (it) forces Sainsbury into further problems, the more it would have to face retaliation,"" Bubb said.
Analysts said supermarkets were more likely to push ahead with initiatives such as loyalty cards, improved customer services and marketing in order to increase sales and profits.
""I think at this stage a price war is unlikely, but if sales fall substantially for any of the big four, that situation could change,"" the analyst said. ($1=.6161 Pound)

47,"Tax changes on long-term assets made in the British budget sparked falls in utility sector stocks on Wednesday but analysts said the concerns might be overdone and expected the sector to recover.
""It is not a welcome move but it should not be a disaster. I do not think it should have a significant impact,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
The changes, proposed by finance minister Kenneth Clarke in the budget on Tuesday, cut capital allowances on assets with a working life of over 25 years to six percent from 25 percent.
The Treasury said it hoped to raise around 1 billion pounds ($1.68 billion) over three years from the move.
Shares in utilities fell across the board, with water company Anglian Water down five pence to 566 pence at 1150 GMT, Yorkshire Water losing seven pence to 677 pence and Severn Trent slipping nine pence to 671 pence.
Multi-utility Hyder slid 18 pence to 738 pence.
Among energy and power companies, PowerGen shed eight pence to 571.5 pence and Yorkshire Electricity lost 7.5 pence to 772 pence.
""The tax changes are definitely why the shares are down,"" one analyst said. The proposals will affect companies spending over 100,000 pounds a year on long-term fixed assets with exceptions for shipping and rail businesses and office buildings.
Utilities could be particularly vulnerable because they have large amounts of infrastructure and plant which will require future investment, analysts said.
""But a billion pounds across all companies means the impact will be pretty small for each business,"" one analyst said.
Companies were largely unwilling to comment immediately on the likely impact, with United Utilities and Southern Electric both saying it was too early to assess.
But both companies might give further details when they report half year results on Thursday, analysts said.
The change has been seen by some observers as pre-empting the opposition Labour party's proposals for a one-off ""windfall"" tax levy on utilities for what are seen as excess past profits.
These plans, from a party which is well ahead of the Conservative government in polls running up to a general election in the next six months, have been keeping a dampener on utility stocks recently.
Analysts said the changes in the budget would mean that any windfall tax imposed by a Labour government might hit companies harder.
Estimates are that a Labour government might seek to raise five billion pounds or more from such a measure in order to finance measures to combat youth and long-term unemployment.
At the same time, Labour might seek to reverse the changes on capital allowances, analysts said, as it pushes for increased investment by companies.
""These measures could reduce Labour's ability to push ahead with any windfall tax, on the other hand the party might repeal the changes to encourage investment,"" the analyst said.
""Utility shares have been discounted because of worries over any plans for a windfall tax by Labour. Today's falls could make some of them more attractive for canny investors,"" he added. ($1=.5956 Pound)

47,"British regional electricity company Northern Electric on Monday promised to rush out results by the end of November to prove that a $1.225 billion hostile bid from America's CE Electric undervalued it. But CE Electric said it still felt its 630 pence per share offer was full and fair, adding that there was ""nothing in Northern Electric's defence document which changes our view.""
In its first formal defence since CE Electric posted its bid on November 5, Northern said the half-year figures, previously scheduled for December 5, would include ""important financial information"" to show the value of the company. It reiterated its belief that the offer was too low and said that when CE Electric announced the bid at the end of October, it had suggested a price of 700 pence per share.
But CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by U.S. energy group CalEnergy, denied this in a statement on Monday, saying: ""This ambitious range was entirely the proposal of Northern Electric's board.""
The U.S. group has already snapped up nearly 30 percent of its target, as Northern's shares were clouded by uncertainty over whether the government would approve the bid. Northern shares eased half a penny to 608-1/2 pence by 1543 GMT. Northern confirmed it planned to pay a 56.5 pence special dividend in February 1997 if CE Electric's offer lapsed and said that could mean the U.S. firm stood to reap gross yields of over 9.5 percent a year from its net investment. ""Northern Electric is worth more to CE Electric,"" the company said in a statement. But CE Electric said the special dividend was ""fully reflected"" in the share price before the offer was launched. Northern chairman David Morris said the company believed that uncertainty as to whether CE Electric's bid would be referred to the MMC (Monopolies and Mergers Commission) was dominating the market's reaction and keeping the share low. The British government has approved takeovers of seven of the original 12 cash-rich regional electricity companies (Recs) in two years, of which three were bought by U.S. companies. Only two bids for Recs have been blocked, when offers from generators National Power and PowerGen were deemed against the public interest by trade secretary Ian Lang. Northern itself is the only Rec to have survived a hostile bid, when it fended off Trafalgar House, now a unit of Kvaerner, with a 560 million pound ($934.2 million) benefit package last year.
Since Northern came under threat, East Midlands Electricity agreed to a 670 pence per share $2.15 billion takeover by Dominion Resources of the U.S. last week. Bid speculation has sparked price rises in other RECS, including Yorkshire Electricity.
A report in the Sunday Telegraph said Yorkshire was in talks with Entergy of the U.S., but both firms denied this on Monday.Shares in Yorkshire gained 12 pence to 747-1/2 pence while East Midlands slipped 2-1/2 pence to 623 pence. The market is worried that political pressures on the ruling Conservative government, which opinion polls put in second place before the general election less than six months away, might prompt it to block any more bids.
The electricity sector, privatised by the Conservatives in 1989, has proved unpopular due to high dividend payouts, hefty executive pay packets and head-turning takeover deals.

47,"British supermarket group Safeway Plc is currently seeing a zero inflation rate excluding petrol, deputy chairman David Webster told Reuters in an interview.
""Inflation excluding petrol is now probably zero,"" he said.
But Webster said the fall in prices was ""nothing to do with a price war.""  
Webster said he felt shoppers ""are pulling in their belts a little more than usual,"" and added he felt it was ""a sector issue.""
But he said he thought a price war remained ""very unlikely.""
Safeway said in a statement that price inflation had fallen in the early weeks of the new year from a modest 1.1 percent gain seen in the five weeks to January 4.
It said sales growth over the key Christmas trading period had been 5.2 percent but over the first 16 weeks of the second half that had slowed to a 4.5 percent gain.
""In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance,"" Webster said.
Safeway said in its statement that if current rates of sales growth and inflation continued, profits in the final eight weeks of its year, which ends in March, might be affected.
Webster said it was ""very hard to judge"" whether the slowdown in sales would continue. ""We continue to see significant deflation in produce, which is 10 percent of total sales,"" he said.
He declined to give details of the impact on margins, however.

47,"British retail chain Kingfisher Plc said on Friday it would axe 1,200 jobs from the Norweb retail chain it bought in November 1996 and shut stores to integrate the purchase with its Comet electrical chain.
In a statement, Kingfisher said it would close 28 Norweb retail stores, which also sell electrical goods, along with 26 Comet stores and upgrade Comet out-of-town stores to raise the total number nationwide to 250 from a current 225 sites.
A further 26 Norweb retail stores in locations new to Comet would become Comet stores, Kingfisher said in a statement.
It added that Comet would go ahead with plans announced by Norweb retail last year before it was taken over to close all the chain's 57 high street sites at the beginning of March.
A further 26 Norweb retail stores in locations new to Comet will become Comet stores, Kingfisher said in a statement.
Norweb's total workforce before the job cuts numbers about 2,800.
""This acquisition is a good strategic move and will provide Comet with a significant number of first class retail locations and experienced people,"" said Kingfisher chief executive Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy.
Kingfisher bought Norweb retail for 51 million pounds ($85.30 million) from United Utilities, which had taken over regional electricity company Norweb around a year ago.
Kingfisher also announced on Friday that it had issued a 200 million pound bond, which analysts said was likely to be used for restructuring debt.
But some said the issue could focus attention again on reports earlier this week Kingfisher might increase its stake in French electrical retailer BUT, although BUT described an article in Thursday's Financial Times as ""unfounded.""
""The bond issue doesn't surprise me as it will help to restructure debt. But it will certainly focus attention on the BUT stake again,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
Kingfisher declined to comment on the report on Thursday and there was no-one available to comment on Friday.
Kingfisher already holds a 26 percent stake in BUT and the Financial Times said on Thursday it was planning to mount a takeover offer, which the newspaper estimated could cost up to 300 million pounds.
Kingfisher bought the stake in BUT, which is France's second biggest furniture chain and fourth largest electricals group last year for 59 million pounds.
Under the deal, it should have to wait until 1998 before making any offer but analysts suggested this might be adjusted if Kingfisher were interested in raising its stake.
Analysts said such a move would be beneficial to Kingfisher.
""It would certainly be earnings enhancing in the first year,"" the analyst said.
He said Kingfisher would reap benefits from integrating BUT stores with its French electrical retailer Darty, which is the market leader. ""Darty is star quality on electricals with higher returns on sales than Dixons,"" the British electrical retail chain, said the analyst.
""Combining the two could boost returns on BUT's electricals, which has turnover of around 500 million pounds but makes little profit,"" he added.
But analysts remained cautious that such a deal might be in the offing. ""I don't think it will happen this year, I think they might have to wait until 1998,"" said one sector analyst.

47,"British spirits, pubs and fast food outlet group Allied Domecq on Tuesday reported a fall in annual profits but effectively ruled out a demerger of its spirits business as a solution to its problems.
Allied chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said in a statement the company was ""clear that the best way to improve shareholder value is to improve operating performance and that this should be our overriding objective for the foreseeable future.""
Costs of a demerger, which the market had hoped was on the cards, would have been ""very, very expensive,"" chief executive Tony Hales said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television.
It would have distracted management for at least 12 months, he said, adding that there was ""no obvious shareholder value to be unlocked.""
Full-year pretax profits to August before exceptionals slipped to 575 million pounds ($950.4 million) from 645 million previously but were within analyst forecasts of between 560 and 581 million.
Allied Domecq said exceptional losses for the year totalled 311 million pounds, the largest part of which was on the 205 mllion pound sale of its 50 percent stake in brewer Carlsberg-Tetley to Bass in August.
Allied paid out a total dividend of 23.59 pence a share, unchanged from the year ending March 1995, which was used as a comparison because of a change to its accounting period.
""The figures were very much in line with expectations. Some people had been worried the dividend may be cut but it has been maintained and that's positive,"" one analyst said.
Allied's shares had shed 15 pence to 453 pence by 1330 GMT after touching a low of 451 pence.
""The divisions have gone in the direction expected but if you were someone who wanted action -- a demerger or management change -- you haven't got either and there will be some disappointment,"" the analyst said.
But Hales stressed in the interview that there was ""a lot we can do in terms of improving performance.""
The spirits and wines business could benefit from increasing marketing, improving relations with customers, taking more costs out and improving returns on capital employed, he said.
In the retail sector, expansion in the pub business and cost cutting should push business forward, he added.
The company said that the cost of tackling overstocking of U.S. spirits was the main factor in a 14 percent fall in year trading profits in the group's spirits business.
It said it was ""determined to increase prices (in spirits and wines) where we can,"" adding that strong brands and market leadership were the best basis for achieving this.
But it warned that the trading environment ""may offer little prospect of improvement.""
The group's retailing business, which includes pubs and fast food outlets, saw underlying profits rise by four percent during the year and Allied said it saw further opportunities for developing its leading pub brands.
""The important thing now is to get the businesses trading well,"" said one sector analyst who declined to be named.
Some analysts were sceptical, however, that Allied could achieve its goals.
""They are trying to do the right things, but they have poor raw material,"" the sector analyst said. ($1=.6050 Pound)

47,"British supermarket chain Safeway, known for cute kid adverts and innovative technology, turned in a seven percent rise in half year profits on Thursday and said sales were rising with hopes of a cheery Christmas.
""I am positive about Christmas, there are some good statistics on retail generally...I would hope that (consumers) would have more confidence to spend,"" chief executive Colin Smith said in an interview.
The company announced plans to open 450,000 square feet (41,810 sq metres) of extra space, or about 18 stores, in the next two years, which will generate about 5,200 jobs.
But with the company's profits and dividend coming in towards the lower end of expectations, Safeway shares reversed a recent trend to slip to a low of 362 pence, down nine, before recovering to 370 by 1150 GMT,
Safeway checked in half year pretax profits of 228.2 million pounds ($383.5 million), compared with forecasts of between 228 and 231 million. It paid a dividend of 4.4 pence, up from 4.05 pence and within forecasts of 4.4 to 4.6 pence per share.
The company, which completed its ""Safeway 2000"" strategic review in the summer aimed at boosting sales and cutting costs, said sales from existing stores were up five percent in the first five weeks of the second half.
That followed a 5.1 percent gain in the first half, including price inflation of 2.6 percent.
""Our strategy to attract more family shoppers to our stores is succeeding and this success is reflected in sales growth which is outperforming the industry average,"" the company said.
But Smith said the sector was ""very competitive...and margins at the moment are slightly down.""
Supermarkets are attempting to steer clear of an all-out price war by relying on marketing initiatives such as loyalty cards and customer service to boost sales, but pricing remains a key element.
In the first half, a fierce petrol price war hit profitability in Safeway's petrol forecourts to the tune of 10 million pounds, but Smith said he hoped this would not impact on the second half.
Gross margins have run slightly down on a year ago in the first half and start of the second half, Safeway said, driven by ""our immediate and vigorous response to a number of significant marketing and pricing initiatives launched by our competitors.""
But net margins were stable in the first half at 6.9 percent as productivity gains and efficiency improvements helped.
The supermarket chain plans to extend its innovative self-scan shopping, where customers track and total their own shopping to avoid queueing at checkouts. The scheme will be added at 50 stores on top of the current 100.
Smith said the company would continue to focus on the family shopper and the large family weekly shop to boost sales.

47,"London Electricity on Tuesday became the latest British regional electricity company (Rec) to attract bid speculation after U.S. firm Entergy was reported to be mulling a 1.2 billion pound bid.
London Electricity declined comment on a report in the Wall Street Journal Europe that confidential documents showed the U.S. company was seeking 1.1 billion pounds to acquire an unnamed British electricity firm whose financial profile matched that of London Electricity.
Entergy told Reuters that any talks with another party were ""too early in the scheme of things to be really meaningful.""
""As far as specifying a target of that interest, we're not simply going to comment on what has been speculated and rumoured,"" Entergy spokesman Patrick Sweeney said.
However, he declined to deny the Wall Street Journal Europe article.
Shares in London Electicity touched a high of 671 pence before easing back to close at 667 pence, up 30-1/2 pence. The newspaper article said confidential Entergy company documents referred to used a code name ""Atlantic"" for the target company whose financial profile met that of London Electricity on a number of points.
The Journal said the bid was assumed in the documents to be for around 700 pence per share. The newspaper quoted Entergy's Sweeney as saying Entergy was interested in the British market and ""obviously if you're interested, one of the results could be an acquisition.""
The article followed a denial by Entergy on Monday of a report in Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper that the U.S. firm was considering a bid for Yorkshire Electricity Group Plc. The electricity sector has seen a flurry of bid speculation recently over the five remaining independent Recs. Northern Electric currently faces its second hostile offer in less than two years as it tries to fend off a $1.225 billion.

47,"British opposition Labour party's plans for a one-off ""windfall"" tax on utility companies may be causing more stock market damage through uncertainty than the tax itself would, analysts said on Thursday.
If it won the next general election, due within six months, Labour has said it would levy a tax to reap excess profits from recently privatised utilities to help pay for welfare reform.
""The market does not like uncertainty -- give it a tax like this with no parameters and it will assume the worst-case scenario,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
As parliament prepared to debate the issue, at the prompting of the ruling Conservatives, analysts said if the Labour party would be more specific about plans, some of the uncertainty weighing on utility shares might lift.
""They have promised to raid the utilities but they have not said which, how much or when, and that is damaging,"" said Philip Hollobone, analyst at Williams de Broe.
Labour, which is well ahead in opinion polls, has said it would use the funds to tackle youth and long-term unemployment but has declined to set target companies, amounts or timeframes.
Newspaper reports have suggested the tax might be aimed at raising more than five billion pounds ($8.42 billion) and possibly as much as 10 billion pounds.
Speculation on possible targets has widened to include up to 30 companies, like British Telecom, British Gas and perhaps airport operator BAA Plc, in addition to the water and electricity companies initially pointed to.
Some of these, such as BAA, have already rehearsed arguments why they should not be included in any windfall tax net.
The water and electricity sectors, privatised around the start of the decade by the Conservatives, became unpopular after a spate of huge executive pay rises, hefty dividend payouts, and head-turning takeovers deals.
One analyst who declined to be named, suggested that the water sector stocks are currently undervalued by around five billion pounds, reflecting concerns over the tax.
Thames Water, for example, has underperformed the FT All Share Index by as much as 10 percent since late August, according Reuters Securities 3000 data, although its relative has improved recently to underperformance of some four percent.
Shares in regional electricity companies, however, were pulled in two directions as a resurgence of bids in the sector boosted speculation which analysts said may have offset some of the downside of a utility tax.
""The worries over the windfall tax are severely overdone...even if it does happen, most companies will be able to find the money, even if they do not want to,"" said Hollobone.
Along with several other analysts, he warns that even if Labour does win power it may not be able to effect the tax because of legal problems in ensuring it is non-discriminatory.
Several utility companies have said they would challenge any windfall tax plans in court, but Labour's treasury spokesman Gordon Brown described the proposal as ""legally iron tight.""
On Thursday, the Institute of Directors (IoD), which represents British business interests, warned against the tax although it acknowledged that ""some of the utilities do have spare funds at the moment.""
The IoD said the tax could lead to problems over who should pay what amounts and said customers might face increased prices.
The Conservatives have claimed the tax could mean an extra 192 pounds on the average household bill and challenged Labour to come up with figures to contradict this.
""Investors who are wise to the market's over-caution on the proposed tax are buying. These stocks are undervalued and...some are yielding more than long-term bonds,"" said one analyst.

47,"British utility Northern Electric Plc made a last-ditch attempt Monday to remain independent by trying to overturn the extension of an offer by CE Electric that gives the U.S. company a majority of its shares.
Britain's takeover panel was meeting Monday to consider an application by Northern and its advisers BZW to appeal the board's unusual decision to extend the bid. The panel extended the deadline on the 782 million British pound ($1.3 billion) bid from Dec. 20 until Dec. 24.
The panel extended the fiercely fought bid on Friday in what newspaper reports said was a reaction to BZW's initial failure to disclose an extra 250,000 pound ($417,000) fee related to its performance in the bid.
""Following the investigation, the executive will consider what, if any, further action is appropriate,"" the panel said in a brief statement.
The panel noted it may also look into the acquisition by BZW and investment bank Schroders of 2.32 percent of Northern Electric's shares last week.
As the initial deadline expired, CE had obtained control of only 49.77 percent of Northern. But after the deadline was extended until Christmas Eve, CE notched that total up to 50.13 percent, a majority that would have given it victory.
But acceptances after the initial deadline require consent from the Takeover Panel. Northern is now fighting to appeal the extension to try to make the late acceptances null and void and to retain its independence.
""If the panel rejects the right to appeal, or the appeal fails, then Northern will be taken over. If the appeal committee says the panel was wrong to extend the bid, then Northern stays independent,"" said one analyst who declined to be identified.
At Northern's request, dealing in its shares was temporarily suspended from Monday morning, standing at 638 pence ($10.68), pending the conclusion of the appeal process.
CE, which is 70 percent owned by Omaha-based CalEnergy, then complained to the panel last week about share purchases made by BZW and Schroders. The panel said there was nothing wrong with those share purchases but did rule out further buying by BZW and Schroders when it extended the deadline.
A BZW official told Reuters that the fee from Northern was not in any way linked to BZW buying of Northern shares.
Northern had fought hard to fend off CE Electric's 650 pence ($10.88) per share bid, which it claimed undervalued the company, promising a 17 percent rise in its final dividend and lower than expected debt.
CE Electric, which raised its original 630 pence ($10.55) offer on Dec. 6, maintained that it was offering a fair price and has already bought nearly 30 percent of Northern on the market. It has said it will hang on to that stake even if its bid fails, which analysts said could depress Northern's shares.
The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds ($933 million) fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year.

31,"Britain's largest brewer Scottish and Newcastle Plc announced a 26 percent increase in half-year profits to 195.1 million pounds ($328 million) on Monday and said the second half of the year had started positively.
The company's acquisition of Courage from Australian brewer Fosters last year helped give a 67 percent push to 89.9 million pounds in trading profits from its beer divisions.
""Overall, I think our 10 percent dividend increase, at the top end of the (forecast) range, is a measure of our confidence for the second half of the year,"" chief executive Brian Stewart told Reuters in an interview.
The dividend rise to 7.21 pence per share beat most analysts' forecasts which were centred on a 7p payout.
""General trading conditions are at least as good as they were this time last year and there has been a bit of an improvement in mainland Europe,"" he added.
The company's shares rose 7p to 647p. ""The results were well ahead of our expectations. The really surprising number was the one that came in from beer. We were very impressed,"" said James Wheatcroft, an analyst at Panmure Gordon.
A Reuter poll of analysts produced a forecast range of 178 to 198 million pounds for pretax profits.
Beer sales fell by just over one percent compared with the first half of 1995 which was bolstered by outstanding summer weather, said the company. Despite this, S&amp;N said sales of John Smith's, the country's leading ale, were up 17 percent and sales of Foster's lager grew 6.5 percent to its highest ever volume.
Stewart, however, bemoaned the failure of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to reduce excise duty on beer in his Budget last week.
Profits from its S&amp;N's Center Parcs activity holiday resorts were down 11 percent at about 44 million pounds due to the weak economic background in mainland Europe and the cost of improving its facilities in the Netherlands and Belgium.
The company sold its smallest village at Lommerbergen, Netherlands, and had to close its De Eemhof parc in Belgium while it upgraded the centre.
""We would expect Center Parcs to be much more on the front foot in the second half and we would quite clearly spell out that conditions in Germany are now more positive,"" said Stewart.
Profits from the company's pubs grew 8.2 percent to 87 million pounds, driven by its managed outlets where like-for-like food sales across the estate grew by 13 percent as the company put more restaurants into its premises.
The company will open 35 new Chef &amp; Brewer pub restaurants by the end of the year and push the Barras &amp; Co community pub brand very strongly, said Stewart.
""We will really be pushing down the accelerator on our community pubs Barras. Our focus has previously been on the high street or city centre and these community pubs really have a great deal of potential,"" he said.
Profits from S&amp;N's tenanted pubs fell some nine percent to 11.8 million pounds after the company was forced to sell off outlets to comply with a government requirement, imposed as a condition of S&amp;N's acquisition of Courage.

31,"British leisure and brewery group Whitbread Plc said on Thursday it had appointed David Thomas as its chief executive designate to take over from Peter Jarvis who is to step down next summer.
Thomas's appointment was viewed by the investment community as a natural progression from the Jarvis era, which saw Whitbread aggressively transform itself from a brewer to a diversified leisure company in less than six years.
Since 1985, Whitbread has changed its business mix. Beer now only accounts for 14 percent of profits, with the rest coming from its managed estates, restaurant and leisure arm.
Analysts expect Thomas to press ahead with Whitbread's expansion into the leisure and restaurant business while retaining its interest in brewing.
""It's just going to be basically more of the same, he's going to continue to take them down the retail, leisure route,"" said Charles Winston, an analyst at BZW.
A slide in Whitbread shares, down 12.5p at 763p, was attributed more to profit-taking than any disappointment at the new executive appointment.
""It's more of a tribute to Jarvis than a thumbs down for Thomas. They have also had a very good run up of late,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
""We knew he was going to leave before retirement age although these announcements are always a bit of a surprise when they come,"" said John Beaumont, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
But he added: ""The appointment of David Thomas seems like a natural progression for the company.""
Thomas, who was appointed to the main board in 1991 and took over the restaurant and leisure division in 1992, is credited with accelerating the development of Whitbread's existing brands -- Travel Inn, restaurants TGI Friday's and Beefeater.
He was also the architect of Whitbread's drive into the pub food market through Brewers Fayre.
Jarvis, aged 55, has hinted to reporters at recent news conferences that he would prefer to leave the company before reaching retirement age in order to pursue outside interests. He is currently a non-executive director of Burton, Rank and Barclays Plc.

31,"British sweetener and animal feed producer Tate &amp; Lyle Plc issued a profits warning on Thursday as the strength of sterling on foreign exchange markets stripped 7.1 million pounds from its profits in the first quarter.
""Results for the half year to March 1997 are expected to be below those for the corresponding period but above those achieved in the second half of the 1996 financial year,"" said the company in an annual statement to shareholders.
The company made pretax profits of 168.2 million pounds ($272.4 million) in the six months to March 30, 1996 and full year profits of 276.3 million, down 11.2 percent on the year.
Tate &amp; Lyle said if current exchange rates prevailed for the rest of its financial year, results for the full-year would be ""marginally"" lower than the 1996 year.
But Tate shares staged a recovery from their recent lows, gaining 10 pence to 435, after remarks about the performance of its North American unit Staley were less negative than had been feared.
The company said the currency impact resulted from the translation of foreign currencies and the EU Common Agricultural Policy currency mechanism.
The revaluation of the green pound hit results at Tate &amp; Lyle Sugars in the first quarter where profits were cut by 1.6 million pounds.
""Excluding this currency impact, profit before tax for the quarter was, as expected, below the corresponding period last year which had benefited from good margins in maize sweeteners in the U.S.,"" said the company.
The company said results for the year in dollars at Staley would be in line with its forecasts because of reduced costs and a shift in production towards non-high fructose corn syrup products.
Tate said high fructrose corn syrup prices remained highly competitive but ""management initiatives have reduced costs and directed production towards non-HFCS products.""
The company added that favourable trends in America's sugar markets and reduced operating costs had resulted in higher dollar profits in the group's American sugar companies compared with last year's first quarter.
It said the improvement would more than offset the expected downturn at Staley.
""The statement wasn't as bearish as some had feared,"" said one senior trader.
David Lang, analyst at Henderson Crossthwaite, said there were signs that Tate's prospects were improving, pointing to the company's statement that first-half profits would be above levels in the second half of last year.
""I think the market should take comfort from that. There is a major turnaround coming,"" Lang said.
""If you take a long-term view you would be a buyer. The recovery is starting lower than we thought and next year could be tough, but the long-term outlook is improving.""
The company said profits from its sweetener and starches operations in Africa improved in the first quarter.
But lower production cut profit contributions from Australia and adverse conditions in Russia and Thailand hit results from sugar trading operations.

31,"Regional brewer Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershad Plc on Tuesday reported an 8.5 percent decline in sales of its key brand ale Marston Pedigree in the first half of the year due to the rising popularity of so-called nitrokegs.
But the ale increased its market share by one percent as its competitors real ales suffered even more. Overall sales of the company's own brewed beers rose 0.5 percent and it launched its own nitrokeg, Marston's Bitter Smoothbrewed, in the Spring.
""Nitrokeg is having quite an effect in terms of market share,"" said chief executive David Gordon in an interview.  
The company's shares were 5p lower at 275p. But the country's two largest brewers -- Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Bass -- who boast a huge portfolio of brands, saw their shares rise.
S&amp;N shares were up 6p at 667p after announcing an unexpectedly strong 26 percent rise in its half year profits on Monday. Unlike traditional beers, nitrokegs do not undergo a secondary fermentation in the cask.  
Brewers have scurried to launch their own nitrokegs after the runaway success of Bass-owned Caffrey's, which sold fast in the scorching 1995 summer.
Caffrey's, served chilled, has taken traditional real ale drinkers away from warmer ales and also attracted premium lager drinkers.
Earlier Marston, Thompson reported a 5.3 percent increase in its pretax profits to 14.7 million stg in the half year ended September 28, driven by strong food and liquor sales in its managed estate.  
Food sales were up by 18.9 percent and now account for 30.8 percent of total sales in its managed pub estate. The company's managed estate of 242 pubs made operating profits of 9.4 million up 12.2 percent.
""There is no evidence that demand is dropping. The average spend per head is seven pounds for food and the retired elderly and the young can afford to do that maybe two or three times a week,"" said Gordon.
""I feel there is a touch more consumer confidence,"" he said, adding conditions were better now than for six or seven years.
In a separate statement, Belhaven Brewery said it managed to increase sales of Belhaven Best despite tougher competition from other nitrokegs. Belhaven shares were unchanged at 188p.

31,"British tobacco and insurance company B.A.T Industries reported a nine percent rise in nine-month profits on Wednesday but conceded U.S. tobacco litigation was the dominant issue affecting its share price.
Profits in the nine months rose to 2.04 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from 1.87 billion last time. Profits in the third quarter rose to 714 million from 680 million pounds.
Trading profit from financial services rose by three percent, and profits from tobacco were seven percent ahead.
Overall cigarette sales rose by three percent, although volumes were lower in the United States, a market where total industry sales were flat, the company said.
Chief executive Martin Broughton told a meeting fo share analysts, ""...the dominant issue affecting the share price for B.A.T Industries currently is U.S. litigation, regulation and indeed science.""
The growing pace of litigation claims against the company's U.S. tocacco subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson, and the U.S. industry in general, continues to unsettle investors and hurt B.A.T's share price.
B.A.T shares have fallen from a high of 585 pence on February 2 to around 434 pence, shedding nearly four billion pounds from the company's stockmarket value along the way.
But Broughton said the company did not see value in demerging the group into separate tobacco and financial services companies.
He told Reuters that a recent strategy review showed ""there was no value we could see that would be generated from a demerger.""
Chairman Lord Cairns said in the results statement that the company had never kept from the public any conclusions showing that smoking causes diseases.
Broughton, responding to a recent paper in Science Magazine in the U.S. which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, told analysts the company had no internal research which proved that smoking caused lung cancer, or that smoking was addictive.
He said there was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking.
Turning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.
In financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year. In Britain, its Eagle Star insurance division faced fiercely competitive conditions and profits fell to 162 million pounds from 194 million.
The life insurance and investment business reported a five percent increase in profit.
Shares in the company initially rose after the results, but later fell back to show a loss of 2-1/2 pence by 1130 GMT.
""The numbers are almost exactly in line with expectations, in fact if anything towards the top end of the range,"" said BZW analyst Nyren Scott-Malden. ($1=.6223 Pound)

31,"John McGrath, chief executive of food and drinks giant Grand Metropolitan Plc said the company will continue to unshackle itself from production in its mission to bear down on costs.
""In many cases we don't need to produce what we sell,"" McGrath told Reuters. ""Whether you own the processing is often academic as long as you control the quality.""
The company is looking at further Seneca-type deals in the next year, he said, where a third party takes on the production but GrandMet keeps hold of pricing, marketing and quality.  
Last year, GrandMet contracted out to U.S. company Seneca the processing and packaging of its Green Giant's canned vegetables. Green Giant was acquired as part of Pillsbury, GrandMet's U.S. food arm, in 1989.
Pillsbury currently produces some 75 percent of what it sells and this number will decline in the future.
If a product can be insulated by patent from the competition, then GrandMet would want to continue making it, said McGrath in an interview. But, if it's a bread or biscuit product, for instance, it may make economic sense to allow a third party producer in.  
""We would never get out of distilling whisky or blending... that is a skill which only a few highly skilled people can ensure. They know how to get the right quality, the right taste, the right balance. But, whether you need to bottle it yourself is another matte,"" McGrath said.
""The best example is Coca-Cola who are brand marketeers, brand owner and controllers of the concentrate. But, whether they own the processing is academic as long as they control the quality.""  
McGrath paid tribute to former chairman Lord Sheppard, who stood down as chairman in March, after 21 years with the group, for transforming GrandMet into a leaner, more focused company.
When Sheppard took over in 1987, he found a company with over 30 very different business which he thinned down to three: food, drinks and Burger King retailing.
McGrath, appointed chairman and chief executive of International Distillers and Vintners (IDV), GrandMet's spirits arm, in September 1993, brought a tough, cost-conscious urge to make Sheppard's vision work.  
McGrath, whose management skills stem from the shopfloor and operations rather than boardroom, separates himself from the culture of GrandMet's heady, deal-making days of the last decade when companies were carved up and sold on in droves.
""The view I take which the board strongly supports is concentrating on making those very expensive assets that we have acquired work highly efficiently.""
""Now is the time to concentrate on organic growth very strongly supported by new brand development. We will only make minor acquisitions chiefly in emerging markets or food service in the U.S. where we can get some good returns,"" he said.
""What I am very much concentrating on now is taking all the action we possibly can to as rapidly as possible increase our return on capital,"" said McGrath.
""We are investing for the medium term and no longer for short term gain,"" he said.

31,"British consumers are feeling better, they are spending more on leisure, and the upward trend is set to roll for at least another two years, said Whitbread chief executive Peter Jarvis.
""The markets in which we operate are better than they have been for many years. People are feeling better. House prices are rising again, the job situation is better and they have seen personal tax decreases this year,"" Jarvis said in an interview.
Earlier Whitbread posted a 14 percent rise in half year pretax profits to 177.5 million, beating analysts forecasts.  
""I think the consumer position in Britain is favourable for at least two or three years. Unless we have some kind of catastrophe, the prospects in Britain are good. All the economic predictions from the banks point to low inflation and growing consumer confidence,"" said Jarvis.
He said the outlook was unlikely to be affected by the government's budget statement on November 26 or if the opposition Labour Party wins the next general election. Labour have pledged to introduce a national minimum wage.
""I'm on the record as being in favour of a national minimum wage. I hope and believe it will be set at a reasonable level.""  
Whitbread's workforce comprises 42,000 full-time and 33,000 part-time staff, with many working in catering.
The company's hotels business doubled profits and sales in the six months to August 31. Like-for-like sales were up by 11 percent with occupancy levels and room rates much higher.
""The number of foreign tourists to Britain is growing very, very fast. They spent 13 to 14 billion pounds last year and half of that in London.""
""That's been growing very fast in the last 10 years and its forecast by Henley (forecasting centre) to be the fastest growing sector of the leisure market.""  
Americans stayed at Whitbread's Marriot hotels for the first time in the half year.
""We never had effective marketting in the U.S. for our hotels before. This link up with Marriott in the States gives us a great marketing power. And they are in really attractive places for American visitors like Stratford-upon-Avon and Edinburgh. So we have seen a huge influx of Americans and in many places it has put five extra points on occupancy levels.""
Whitbread acquired health and sports club group David Lloyd Leisure for 200 million stg and a chain of 16 Marriott hotels in Britain for some 185 million in August 1995.  
The company also owns a chain of about 130 low budget Travel Inns, which Jarvis said will be added at the rate of about one every 10 days to reach 300 by the end of the year 2000.
Whitbread plans to expand its hotel presence in London by converting County Hall and bringing Travel Inns into the capital. Consumers also spent more eating out during the half year with Pizza Hut, jointly owned with Pepsico, and TGI Friday's sales ahead by about 20 percent. The Beefeater chain of restaurants increased like-for-like sales three pecent and profit by 7 percent.  
Whitbread Inns, which includes casual dining out pub chain Brewers Fayre, saw profits grow by 15 percent to 77.4 million and total sales by 14 percent.
""The main driving force on like-for-like sales is on food pubs and restaurants and we also opened a lot more new places that appeal to people who would not normally go to pubs,"" said Jarvis.
The group thinks it can add about 40 new Pelican's a year -- the Pelican Group acquired for 133 million in July owns French bistro style cafes the Dome and Cafe Rouge -- bringing the total to about 300.  
""The most satisfying thing for me is the capital we have put into new businesses and invested in them has paid off. They have all performed well.""
Whitbread now owns ""three to four strong concepts that will give us good growth for the next three to four years.""
Whitbread, which confirmed last week it was in talks with BrightReasons about buying its pizza and pasta chains, hopes to agree on terms this month, said Jarvis.
BrightReasons owns a 180-strong chain of restaurants trading as Bella Pasta, Pizza Piazza and Pizzaland.

31,"Cider maker Matthew Clark has put a line under the extent of its losses inflicted mainly by the phenomenal growth of ""alcopops"" and now has a strategy that will turn the company round, said its business development director.
""The numbers we have put into the market today and the issues we have identified, that is all the issues and that is the financial costs of those issues in this whole year,"" said Peter Huntley in an interview. Clark estimated its losses at 22 million for the year from a combination of lower sales and tougher competition over pricing and supply contracts.

31,"Britain's independent brewers on Thursday pressed for a cut in the excise duty on beer ahead of Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's budget statement on November 26.
The brewers are lobbying hard this time round, after Clarke's previous budget cut the duty on Scotch whisky for the first time since 1895, while leaving the rates on beer and wine unchanged. The duty on beer was raised by 2p a pint in 1994.
""Increasing excise duty over a period...has inevitably increased the divergence with our European partners. The single market demands a single fiscal policy and a uniform excise duty,"" said a letter to the Times newspaper from the chairman of the Independent Family Brewers of Britain.
The letter said the group would deliver a petition to the European parliament, asking for the European Commission to take into account the wide differences in excise duty between EU member states on alcoholic drinks and beer in particular.
The Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association (BLRA) are arguing that a 20 percent cut in the beer duty, equivalent to knocking 6p off a pint, would lower inflation, help boost government revenue and discourage illegal cross-border shopping.
Oxford Economic Forecasting researcher Adrian Cooper used the Treasury's own economic model to argue that a 20 percent cut in beer duty would mean lower inflation, more jobs and in the second year of a duty cut more money for the Exchequer.
British duty on a pint of five percent alcohol by volume is 30 pence. In France, it is just four pence, encouraging people to buy their beer in mainland Europe.
The total volume of duty paid beer flooding into the country is estimated by the BLRA to be about 4-1/2 percent of the total beer market. Over half of this is for illegal resale.
The Scotch Whisky Association estimates the government has received 2.0 million stg more in revenue from the industry as a result of the last cut in the whisky duty. It says the reduction has also fed through into lower prices for consumers.
Before last year's budget, a typical bottle of blended whisky costing 10.70 pounds ($18.01) about 67 percent went in tax, with duty at 5.55 pounds a bottle and value added tax at 1.59 pounds.
Since last year's cut in duty, average prices per bottle have fallen to 9.85 pounds for on supermarket own labels, although the price of brands has risen slightly. The Association is pressing for another four percent off duty paid on a bottle.
Britain's tobacco industry wants a freeze on duty, arguing the government is losing revenue because the tax is so high compared with central Europe, that smuggling is rife.
""We would certainly like to see a freeze this year because we are so far out of sight of the rest of Europe that it's causing a major smuggling problem,"" said Clive Turner, media relations at the Tobacco Council. ""The government is currently missing out on 640 million a year in lost revenue,"" he said.
A 50 gram pack of rolling tobacco normally costs about 7.47 stg in Britain but can be bought in Belguim for slightly under 2.0 stg. The Tobacco Council estimate 68 percent of all hand rolling tobacco sold in Britain comes from mainland Europe and some 62 percent of that is smuggled across.
In his last budget statement Clarke, left the duty paid on hand rolling tabacco unchannged but raised thaty on cigarettes by 15 pence per pack. Cigarettes currently retail for around 2.95 pounds.
In the 1993 budget, Clarke pledged to raise tobacco tax on average by the rate of inflation plus at least three percent in future budgets. Last year's rise was equivalent to the rate of inflation plus seven percent. ($1=.5940 Stg)

31,"United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc more than doubled its profits in 1996 to 109 million pounds ($174 million) before tax and exceptional items, reflecting a simpler and slimmed-down portfolio of products.
United, which owns brands such as McVities biscuits and KP nuts but has exited from its U.S. Keebler subsidiary, said total exceptional charges, mainly from the loss on disposal of businesses, amounted to 84.7 million pounds in 1996 compared with 150.3 million in 1995.
Sales rose by three percent to 1.887 billion and trading profits grew four percent to 129.2 million.
Underlying profits growth was in line with stock brokers forecasts, but a presentation by management to analysts was greeted positively, sending the group's shares up 11 pence to 248-1/2p by 1415 gmt.
""It's all quite encouraging. The way they are analysing and managing the business is very much more in line with what the market demands,"" said Richard Workman, an analyst at ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett.
The company said its recovery was strongly led by its British operations, while in mainland Europe, it started to realise the potential of businesses acquired earlier in the 1990's.
UB's British business increased profits before exceptional items by 12 percent to 113.7 million pounds as renewed consumer confidence encouraged shoppers to step up brands.
In an interview UB's managing director Eric Nicoli said UB Has now entered a phase of consolidation after a hectic disposal programme.
""The emphasis is on organic growth as we are now in a consolidation phase,"" said Nicoli.
Over the last two years UB has sold its American snack operation Keebler, pulled out of Portugal and exited from Spanish snacks. It has also sold one of its Italian snack businesses, withdrawn from Turkey and Brazil and sold Ross Vegetables Products business in Britain.
UB expects its margins in Europe to remain firm and to move up over the next two to three years, said Nicoli.
""We expect margins to move to 10 percent in all our businesses over a two or three year period,"" he said.
(Corrects to make clear that company isn't expecting European markets alone to move by 10 percent.)
UB margins are currently at around 10 percent in Britain and four percent in mainland Europe.
In 1997 the company plans to build on the turnaround ""all our markets continue to be very competitive but we expect another year of good progress,"" said Nicoli.
The total dividend payout was increased by 10 pence per share from 9.8p.
The company's leading biscuit brands include McVities in Britain, Verkade in Holland and Oxford in Denmark. Biscuit sales growth came from the launch of Go Ahead! a range of low fat products. UB also owns snacks KP Nuts, Skips and Hula Hoops.
