0,"The potential expansion of the British life and pensions market means Abbey National Plc needs to boost its involvement and lies behind its offer for Scottish Amicable, Abbey chief executive Peter Birch said on Thursday.
Birch was speaking in an interview after Abbey posted an underlying 1996 pre-tax profit 20 percent higher at 1.229 billion stg and raised its dividend a similar amount to 26.1p per share.
""We are very confident that our proposition will be attractive to the ScotAm board and its policyholders,"" Birch said.  
The bank earlier confirmed it would be making a formal bid for ScotAm on Friday but Birch declined to comment on any of the details of the revised bid.
Abbey sparked a bidding war for ScotAm in January when it made a preliminary offer of up to 1.4 billion stg and was followed by a larger bid by insurance giant Prudential Corp.
ScotAm, which had been planning to shed its mutual status and eventually float on the stock exchange, then started a formal bidding process and offers have to be in on Friday.
Abbey is known to be keen to diversify further away from its traditional mortgage lending and savings activities and profits from these other sources now amount to 40 percent of the total.
Birch noted that Abbey's life assurance units raised profit 44 percent in 1996 from a standing start after the purchase of Scottish Mutual five years ago.
""That business has been a very strong earner for us,"" Birch said, ""and as one looks at the future of the country and the need for the private sector to provide benefits in healthcare and pensions, we're still very small...for an organisation that's the 17th largest company in the UK.""
Birch said adding Scottish Amicable makes a lot of sense and provides a great opportunity for Abbey to build on its Scottish-based life business.
Acquisitions are constantly being looked at in other areas of the business, Birch said, as a means of continuing expansion into personal retail financial services.
Birch said Abbey's core mortgage market, where its share rose to a record 14.7 percent, was showings signs of life.
""All the indications in the housing market are that recovery is getting under way,"" Birch said. ""It has a long way to go, a lot of people want to move house...and the market is now stirring in the rest of the country (outside London). We see transactions increasing by seven to 10 percent this year.""
Birch said an expected rise in interest rates after the election would not put a break on the market since this would be offset by low inflation and confidence boosted by a strong economy.
Abbey saw its mortgage margin ease slightly last year with net interest spread at 2.08 percent from 2.15 percent in 1995.
""That doesn't really concern me too much,"" Birch said, ""because we are seeing volume come through. Last year we devoted a lot of time to integrating National &amp; Provincial -- this year, just watch our market share.""

0,"SBC Warburg, the investment banking arm of Swiss Bank Corp, said on Wednesday it had been forced to take a loss on a 300 million pound ($478 million) share deal which is being investigated by Britain's financial markets watchdog.
The deal, the liquidation of part of the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust(KEPIT), is thought to have lost SBC Warburg around two million pounds and led to the resignation of Peter Corrigan, head of French equities, who left the firm last Friday.
Britain's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) confirmed on Wednesday that it is probing the deal.
""I can confirm that SFA is formally investigating SBC Warburg,"" an SFA spokesman said, adding he could make no further comment.
SBC, which announced its 1996 results on Wednesday, did not include a special provision for the loss but executive Marcel Ospel said in Basle that the bank was supporting the investigation ""in every way.""
An SBC Warburg spokesman told Reuters the firm  had ensured that KEPIT had not been disadvantaged as a result of a share sale.
The spokesman said that in connection with a bid for three of KEPIT's portfolios last October, ""the bank sought to sell into the market"" and that this had contributed to adverse price movements of the shares in the portfolios.
The fall in the share prices meant KEPIT might have received less than it had expected for the sale but SBC Warburg said it had ensured that the client did not lose out -- effectively taking the loss, thought to be around two million pounds, onto its own book.
Banking sources said the SFA investigation centred on the sharp fall of several European share prices on October, after SBC Warburg carried out the share sales for KEPIT.
The sources said SBC Warburg is denying allegations of market manipulation and is putting the loss down to an error in its attempt to hedge itself.
It appears this operation was mis-timed and Warburg was punished by the market, later agreeing to book the deal at the price which KEPIT had expected to receive.
Share markets on the day in question, October 30, 1996, were volatile after the Bank of England had raised British interest rates.
The Warburg spokesman said its compliance officials had been notified at once of the deal and had started their own internal investigation.
Sources said the SFA has a duty to investigate the background to such market events, usually as a result of being notified by one of the parties involved.

0,"Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel on Monday announced a deal giving creditor banks 45.5 percent of the company in return for wiping out one billion pounds ($1.56 billion) of its debt mountain.
The long-awaited restructuring brings to an end months of wrangling between Eurotunnel and the 225 banks to which it owes nearly nine billion pounds.
The deal, announced simultaneously in Paris and London, brings the company back from the brink of insolvency but leaves shareholders owning only 54.5 percent of the company.
""The restructuring plan provides Eurotunnel with the medium term financial stability to allow it to consolidate its substantial commercial achievements to date and to develop its operations,"" Eurotunnel co-chairman Alastair Morton said.
The firm was now making a profit before interest, he added.
Although shareholders will see their interests diluted, they were offered the prospect of a brighter future after months of uncertainty while Eurotunnel wrestled to reduce crippling interest payments negotiated during the tunnel's construction.
Eurotunnel, which has taken around half the cross-Channel market from the European ferry companies, said a strong operating performance could allow it to pay its first dividend within the next 10 years.
French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said shareholders would have to be patient before they could reap the benefits of the company's success.
He called the debt restructuring plan ""an acceptable compromise"" for holders of Eurotunnel shares.
The company said in a statement there was still considerable work to be done to finalise and agree the details of the plan before it can be submitted to shareholders and the full 225 bank syndicate for approval, probably early in 1997.
Monday's announcement followed two weeks of highly secretive negotiations between Eurotunnel and its six leading banks. This was extended to the 24 ""instructing banks"" at a meeting late last week in London.
Eurotunnel said the debt-for-equity swap would be at 130 pence, or 10.40 francs, per share. That is considerably below the level of around 160 pence widely reported in the run up to the deal, and will reduce outstanding debt of 8.7 billion pounds by 1.0 billion.
The company said a further 3.7 billion pounds of debt would be converted into new financial instruments and existing shareholders would be able to participate in this issue.
If they choose not to take up free warrants entitling them to subscribe to this, Eurotunnel said shareholders' interests may be reduced further to just over 39 percent of the company by the end of December 2003.
Eurotunnel's shares, which were suspended last week at 113.5 pence ahead of Monday's announcement, should resume trading on Tuesday, the company said. ($1=.6393 Pound)

0,"Royal Bank of Scotland is constantly reviewing its options to expand its distribution channels, especially in the south east of England, its chief executive George Mathewson said on Thursday.
""It's right to assume we've been talking to a lot of people,"" Mathewson told Reuters in an interview. ""People (who are looking for a tie-up) assume they should talk to us because of our lack of penetration in the south east. All I can say is that we are reviewing all the options.""  
He was speaking after the bank announced a 15 percent rise in pretax profits to 695 million stg, towards the higher end of market expectations, which saw Royal Bank shares rise 8p to 530p.
Earlier this year, Royal Bank's arch-rival Bank of Scotland announced a banking joint venture with retailer Sainsburys and other banks are making moves in the same direction.
It has long been assumed that Royal Bank would boost its distribution by buying an English building society and Mathewson again refused to rule out this possibility.  
""That remains a possibility,"" he said. ""Assuming that a building society became available and that the price was not ridiculous.""
Mathewson said any such purchase would have to take into account shareholder value and business criteria like the strength of the brand name.
Some analysts have doubted that Royal Bank's capital position would allow a major purchase but Mathewson dismissed such doubts.  
Noting that its capital ratios had strengthened over the past year (tier one to 6.8 pcercent from 6.3 and total to 11.0 from 10.3), Mathewson said Royal bank would have no trouble raising money if necessary.
""Whatever we have done with our money has been open to market scrutiny -- unlike some other companies,"" Mathewson said. ""We didn't just pay it down the drain. If we need money, we will make a case and we will get it.""
The Royal Bank results included a 22 percent gain for the UK banking operations and a 57 percent rise for its New England banking unit Citizens.  
But difficult trading conditions at its insurance unit Direct Line saw profits there collapse by 86 million stg to just 26 million.
Mathewson said he was not really disappointed by the Direct Line result -- ""But I'd prefer it (profit) to be bigger, don't get me wrong"" -- saying that it stemmed from the higher rate of claims and market pressure against higher prices.
""The pressure in the market means we couldn't put up prices to compensate but we are making an awful lot more than any of our competitors,"" he said.
Mathewson said the outlook was positive for Direct Line.
""But I'm not jumping to any conclusions. Prices are beginning to move (higher), many companies are losing substantial amounts of money and history tells me that can't continue for very long.""
In the UK bank, cost to income ratio dipped to 59.2 percent from 63.2 percent as the effects of the bank's ""Operation Columbus"" restructuring continue to come through. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.

0,"A leasing unit of HSBC Holdings Plc said on Wednesday it would buy recently-privatised British train rolling stock leasing company Eversholt in a politically controversial deal worth 726.5 million pounds ($1.2 billion).
HSBC said its Forward Trust Group financing unit, part of retail banking group Midland Bank plc, would buy Eversholt's shares from their venture capital-backed management owners for 453.4 million pounds and repay debt of 273.1 million pounds.
The widely-leaked Eversholt deal has been heavily criticised by opposition politicians. Labour Party leader Tony Blair on Tuesday said the profits likely to flow to some members of its management was ""entirely unjustified"".
Blair, who is preparing to fight a general election due in the next three months, said in Parliament that the level of gains anticipated for managers after just 14 months as owners of the company could be seen as ""profiteering"".
However, Blair's allegations were based on claims that the deal would be done for 900 million pounds rather than the 726.5 million disclosed today. Eversholt was bought from the government for 580 million pounds.
The Labour party said it would publish a dossier showing how ""fat cats have hit the rail privatisation jackpot"" at a news conference later on Wednesday.
Graham Picken, chief executive of Forward Trust, said it had paid a fair market price for Eversholt and refused to comment on how much money Eversholt's directors might have made on the deal.
""As far as we are concerned, we were presented with the opportunity late last year,"" Picken said in an interview, ""and, after due diligence, we are paying a fair market price.""
Venture capital backer Candover Investments plc said in a separate statement that its 17.7 million pound investment in Eversholt had increased in value to 100.4 million pounds as a result of the sale.
Blair attacked the large sums that Eversholt directors would make on the, saying that its managing director Andrew Jukes was set to make 20 million pounds on an investment of 110,000 pounds.
Picken said the purchase of Eversholt was a natural expansion and excellent fit for Forward Trust which has been providing finance to the automotive and rail industries since 1928.
He said there were substantial opportunities for growth in the business, especially in the area of new rolling stock which the train operating companies will require.
""We believe that the combination of our financial skills and the railway and engineering expertise of Eversholt will make this work,"" Picken added.
Picken foresaw healthy competition in the sector and said new entrants could emerge, although Forward Trust was not planning any further acquisitions.
""We are not opportunistic, leasing is a core area and we are making a long-term commitment,"" Picken said.

0,"Barclays Plc shares dived on Tuesday as the bank reported 1996 pretax profits at the lower end of expectations and a slump in its investment banking unit BZW.
Barclays shares were down 55-1/2 pence at 1144p in afternoon trade, having hit a low of 1131p, after the news that pretax profits at the bank rose by 13 percent to 2.36 billion pounds ($3.8 billion), including an exceptional 70 million pounds gain on disposals.
The shares took a further tumble as analysts returning from meeting the company moved to downgrade the stock. Analysts at SBC Warburg cut the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"", market sources said, and others were cautious on the outlook for the share.
The profits were at the lower end of forecasts and included a 29 percent fall in operating profits at BZW to 204 million pounds.
The company, which has repurchased over one billion pounds of shares in the last 18 months, said it would return 500 million pounds to shareholders in the next twelve months, and raised its dividend by 21 percent to 31.5 pence, in line with forecasts.
But even the buy-back news failed to cheer the market.
""The basic message is that there was disappointment about the headline profits and dividend, the mix of profits and the potential size of any buyback,"" said Michael Lever, analyst at HSBC James Capel.
""The figures were disappointing relative to expectations and everyone will be pulling their numbers back. I don't think they will make much more in 1997 than they did in 1996.""
Market sources said estimates for Barclays pre-tax profit in 1997 were being trimmed by about 200 million pounds.
Barclays chief executive Martin Taylor mounted a spirited defence of the results and his strategy at BZW, saying that the UK banking figures were ""cracking"" and that Barclays was investing for the future at BZW.
""You have to be careful not to be frightened by your own shadow,"" Taylor told Reuters in an interview. ""The reason that the returns are depressed (at BZW) this year is that we're spending so much.""
BZW chief executive Bill Harrison said he plans to improve links between BZW's key areas to build profitable business. He added that the bank's markets division had needed a ""significant upgrade"", but had now been ""re-tooled...and is strongly placed to make a significant earnings contribution.""
In a statement earlier, Barclays admitted underperformance by BZW in the fixed income market, with the exception of sterling, and foreign exchange area.
Taylor said BZW would continue to incur quite high costs in the first half of the current year and would then face the disruption of moving its offices to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands.
""I would hope that the second half would be a lot better,"" he added.
BZW has had had a turbulent time in the past year which started with the death of its chief executive David Band and has included high-level management shake-ups.
On top of this, BZW has also been involved in what have been perceived as some high-profile disasters with its clients. The biggest of these was its takeover defence for Northern Electric against U.S. energy group CE Electric which is being investigated by Britain's Takeover Panel. The late disclosure by BZW of a 250,000 sterling discretionary fee clause meant that CE's offer was extended and it captured Northern by the slimmest of margins.
But Taylor said that well-publicised events last year such as the Northern Electric defence had not done BZW damage.
""I think Northern Electric showed BZW behaving very energetically to try and prevent a client being taken over and almost succeeding,"" Taylor said. ""We very nearly saved it.""
But the head of quity sales at another investment house said, ""The trials and tribulations at the investment banking arm look as if they will probably be continuing into the next year.""
Taylor said Barclays was looking for the best way to return the bank's excess capital to shareholders but rejected the idea of a special dividend, saying that share repurchases help non-sellers to concentrate their position.
He noted that earnings per share had risen by 25 percent to 104.2p per share.
Taylor also rejected the notion that Barclays was devoid of ideas because it wanted to return capital.
He said the bank would make acquisitions if they added to shareholder value but could see none on the horizon at the moment.

0,"Fund management company Mercury Asset Management Plc is expected to post a good rise in pre-tax profits for the first half next Tuesday, having benefited from buoyant exchanges.
On Friday, MAM shares stood near their year highs at 11.32 stg, with analysts expecting pre-tax profits of around 80 million stg, up from 63.6 million stg last time
The market expects a higher interim dividend after six pence last year and some analysts see the company rebalancing the pay-out between the interim and final stage.  
Analysts said Mercury has already proved it can go it alone since it was broken away from former owner S.G. Warburg when the latter was bought by Swiss Bank Corp last year.
At the time, there was talk of Mercury being taken over as banks looked to expand their fund management interests. But, this speculation has evaporated, although the bid premium in MAM's share price may not have, and there is more interest in what Mercury itself might buy.
UBS analyst Martin Cross said any bid premium is unjustified and points out that MAM has a lot of capital, some of which it might want to spend on expansion in the U.S. markets.  
""That could be a worry, however, as there might be a fear that MAM would be buying at the top of the market,"" Cross said.
Phillip Gibbs, an analyst at BZW, said he expects MAM to follow the trend of recent years in making relatively small strategic acquisitions.
""It's been a pretty helpful period in terms of the markets, especially London where the FTSE index went up from 3,700 to 3,954 in the six months we're looking at,"" Gibbs added.
Analysts will be looking at Maercury's cost base to make sure there has been no untoward growth. In any case, cost growth is expected to have been comfortably exceeded by revenue growth.  
Gibbs said the key element would be how much new money MAM has been able to attract as this is the main indicator of the fundamental health of the business.
Mercury will also have profited from realisations in its venture capital business but the effects of problems at other fund managers, notably Morgan Grenfell Asset management, are not expected to have had too much impact in the first half.
Mercury may have picked up some business and the effect may be more marked in the second half. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.

0,"Royal Bank of Scotland on Thursday reported a 15 percent rise in full year pretax profits to 695 million pounds ($1.2 billion) as strong growth in its UK and U.S. banking operations offset a dip at its insurance unit.
Chief Executive George Mathewson told Reuters the bank is constantly reviewing its options to expand market share, especially in the south east of England.
""It's right to assume we've been talking to a lot of people,"" Mathewson said in an interview. ""People (who are looking for a tie-up) assume they should talk to us because of our lack of penetration in the south east. All I can say is that we are reviewing all the options.""
Earlier this year, Royal Bank's arch-rival Bank of Scotland announced a banking joint venture with retailer Sainsburys and other banks are making moves in the same direction including Abbey National, which on Thursday said it would offer financial services in conjunction with supermarket chain Safeway's loyalty card.
It has long been assumed that Royal Bank would boost its distribution by buying an English home loans institution and Mathewson again refused to rule this out.
""That remains a possibility,"" he said. ""Assuming that a building society became available and that the price was not ridiculous.""
Mathewson said any such purchase would have to take into account shareholder value and business criteria like the strength of the brand name.
Some analysts have doubted that Royal Bank's capital position would allow a major purchase but Mathewson dismissed such doubts.
Noting that its capital position had strengthened over the past year, Mathewson said Royal Bank would have no trouble raising money if necessary.
""Whatever we have done with our money has been open to market scrutiny unlike some other companies,"" Mathewson said. ""We didn't just pay it down the drain. If we need money, we will make a case and we will get it.""
Royal Bank said its U.S. bank Citizens, based in New England, lifted profits by 61 million pounds, or 57 percent, adding that it will continue its strategy of deepening its franchise and expanding its core business.
Profits were also higher in UK Banking, up 97 million pounds or 22 percent, and this part of the business also showed a healthy improvement in cost-to-income ratio.
The latter fell to 59.2 percent from 63.2 percent while the group ratio was down to 50 percent from 51.7 percent.
Direct Line, which sells motor, house and life insurance, saw profits shrink by 86 million pounds to 26 million for the year as premium rates continued under pressure and it saw increased claims.
Mathewson said he was not really disappointed by the Direct Line result -- ""But I'd prefer it (profit) to be bigger, don't get me wrong"" -- saying that it stemmed from the higher rate of claims and market pressure against higher prices.
""The pressure in the market means we couldn't put up prices to compensate but we are making an awful lot more than any of our competitors,"" he said.

0,"Royal Bank of Scotland, which reports full year data next Thursday, is expected to raise its pre-tax profit from last year's 602 million stg but not by as much as analysts thought just a few months ago.
They expect Royal Bank's profits to rise to between 670 and 700 million stg, with a much smaller contribution from its Direct Line low cost insurance, but benefits continuing to accrue from the bank's efforts to reduce costs.
Total dividend is expected to be around 18.6 pence a share versus last year's 16.2p.  
The pre-tax figures will be complicated by an exceptional gain from Royal Bank's disposal of its 50 pct stake in Germany's CC Group, from which it said it would make 70 million stg, and by restructuring costs of around 23 million pounds stemming from an acquisition by its New England subsidiary Citizens.
Forecasts for Direct Line vary widely but analysts are generally pessimistic, with the company's main market -- motor insurance -- going through ""probably the most diffucult period in its history"", as chief executive Ian Chippendale told Reuters in an interview last week.  
""I think Chippendale was sending a strong message,"" said one analyst who declined to be named. ""I think he was softening up the market for a poor set of results.""
Some analysts suspect the results may not be quite as poor as hs been feared by some.
They see the core bank as continuing to perform quite well with the positive results of its ""Project Columbus"" helping costs and income.
David Poutney expects a pre-tax profit of 695 million stg, which includes the exceptional items, while BZW analysts expect 675 million.  
The market received a big clue on the performance of Citizens from the recent results of Bank of Ireland which owns 23 percent of the operation.
""Citizens is doing reasonably well,"" Poutney said, but analysts say it is being affected by the rather lacklustre New England economy.
The market will be expecting improvement in the cost income ratio but analysts say that even an improvement this time will leave the bank plenty of scope for improvement.  
The market will be looking for further clues on lending which showed good growth, mostly in corporate lending area, in the first half.
Inevitably, Royal Bank will also be watched for signs of acquisitions.
It is known to be interested in buying a building society to extend its presence in England but in the current climate, it is unlikely to be willing to pay the high prices likely to be asked.
In any case, analysts say Royal Bank would have to raise cash to be able to perform any major acquisition.  
In the meantime, the market will be looking to its relationship with mutually owned insurance and pensions firm Scottish Widows, which some think may result in an eventual merger.
Royal Bank shares were 15p higher on Friday to stand at 519-1/2p.

0,"British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke on Tuesday took the expected step of phasing out tax relief on profit related pay (PRP) schemes.
But analysts were pleasantly surprised the proposal still allowed new schemes to be registered as the tax relief is reduced and were relieved the Chancellor did not abolish the arrangement in one go.
Clarke said there would be no change to the upper limit of pay that is free of income tax, currently 4,000 stg, in profit periods beginning before January 1 1998.  
For 1998 the ceiling will be reduced to 2,000 stg and 1,000 stg in 1999. No relief will be given for profit periods starting on or after January 1, 2000.
""I'm not surprised that the relief was not abolished in one go,"" said Bob Rothenburg of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg. ""It would have created a lot of pressure on employers to compensate employees.""
Douglas Fairbairn of Ernst and Young said he was relieved at the Chancellor's proposals, which could have included immediate abolition.  
For Fairbairn, the main surprise was that new schemes would be allowed at the lower rates of relief.
This was confirmed by the Inland Revenue, where a spokeswoman said if existing schemes were to be allowed to continue, it was only fair that companies wishing to introduce new schemes, even at the lower rates of relief, should be allowed to do so.
Fairbairn said the fact that new schemes were to be allowed, meant he doubted the government's estimate of the yield from the measure would be met.
The Inland Revenue said it expected the proposal to yield 100 million stg in 1997/98; 700 million stg in 1998/99; 1.7 billion stg in 1999/2000; and 3.1 billion stg in 2000/2001.
Tax experts contacted by Reuters said one other possibility for Clarke would have been to limit the relief on PRP to the standard rate of tax, which he reduced to 23 percent from 24 percent, rather than the marginal rate -- currently 40 percent.
After a slow start following its introduction in 1987, there are now around 14,000 PRP schemes covering 3.7 million employees. Take-up of the schemes increased considerably after the tax relief was doubled in 1991.

36,"France Telecom on Thursday announced it was cutting its call tariffs to boost telephone use ahead of its flotation in 1997 and full liberalisation of the market in 1998.
""Now that we are a few months away from our flotation, I would like to unveil our plans,"" chairman Michel Bon told a news conference, reiterating that the first sale of shares in the state operator could be from the second half of April.
He said the exact timing of the sale and details of the capital to be sold depended on market conditions and Finance Minister Jean Arthuis' decisions.
""What is clear is that the government will not sell more than 49.9 percent,"" Bon said. The government has said it will sell about 20 percent in the spring. ""We want to make our market introduction as much a popular success as the Deutsche Telekom sale,"" he said.
From March 4, France Telecom will slash a number of call rates and in October and in 1998 there will be further cuts. The monthly standing charges, however, will increase.
Bon said the reductions were aimed at boosting telecommunications use. ""If the traffic rises by six percent in 1997 the cuts will be good for France Telecom's business model,"" he said, declining to be more specific ahead of the flotation prospectus.
He added that he aimed to increase foreign sales, such as the company's mobile telecommunications subsidiary in Belgium started this year, by 50 percent.
""Our aim is to grow the market. If we grow the market everybody will benefit, we and our competitors,"" he said.
Bon said that recent price cuts had already boosted telephone use and he added that the Itineris mobile telecommunications unit would have 1.3 million subscribers at the end of 1996, against 700,000 in 1995.
Bon said France Telecom's 1996 accounts would not be comparable to previous accounts because they would use U.S. standards. But this would not diminish the value of the company.
France Telecom said it would cut national call rates by 17.5 percent on March 4 and a further 21 percent in October 1997.
This will bring standard call rates to 1.20 francs (22 cents) per minute by end-1997 from 2.30 francs in 1994.
International rates will be slashed by 20 percent in March, putting all European countries at less than 2.50 francs per minute and North America at less than three francs.
France Telecom said it would raise its monthly standing charge by 15.20 francs to 68 francs, but added this was still one of the lowest rates in Europe.

36,"France announced plans to create a major new force in the world defence industry on Wednesday, by selling state-owned defence and consumer electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe for a symbolic franc.
The government said it had preferred the bid by Lagardere, which owns defence company Matra, to the rival offer of largely civilian industrial group Alcatel Alsthom SA.
""The choice I made yesterday and which has been made public today is entirely based on a defence industrial logic,"" Prime Minisiter Alain Juppe told parliament
""We have opted for the offer which was the best to further our defence interest and which would constitute a world leading industrial group with strong export capacities,"" he said.
""The offers were comparable on a financial level. They both needed a capital increase,"" Finance Minister Jean Arthuis told a news conference. The state will make an 11 billion franc ($2.1 billion) cash injection to Thomson SA prior to the sale.
Challenged in parliament about the cash injection, Arthuis said that ""Both Alcatel and Lagardere valued Thomson SA at minus 11 billion francs""
Loss-making Thomson SA owns 58 percent of defence electronics company Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics maker Thomson Multimedia which specialises in digital television and decoders and has Saba and RCA as brands.
Lagardere said it is bidding 156 francs a share, or 7.8 billion francs in total, to buy the minorities in Thomson-CSF which it will then merge with Matra. Lagardere will keep 60 percent of Thomson Matra while the French state will have a golden share to safeguard national security interests.
Lagardere will sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea.
The government said Daewoo was a well known investor in France and had knowledge of mass production techniques. Daewoo has made commitments on jobs -- creating 3,000 new jobs in France -- technology and investments.
Thomson Multimedia management will remain French-based.
Arthuis said the European Commission would have to approve the cash injection and study competition issues. He said the sale would take place before the end of the year and the cash for the injection would come from other privatisations.
The independent privatisation commission, which has an important say in the sale of state assets, still has to give its advice on the sale. Arthuis said the government had not wanted to keep its choice secret, as would have been usual, until the privatisation commission's advice ""to avoid insider trading"".
The decision was a surprise as markets and the media had gambled Alcatel's no-nonsense chairman Serge Tchuruk would take the prize over self-made entrepreneur Jean-Luc Lagardere, 69, who is preparing to hand over power to his son, Arnaud.
Lagardere also owns publishers Hachette and Filipachi.
Thomson SA lost 1.379 billion francs in 1995 and has 25 billion francs of debt. Wholly-owned Thomson Multimedia lost three billion in the first half of 1996, but Thomson-CSF is profitable and had 1995 earnings of 1.01 billion francs.
The government said Lagardere wanted to leave the share capital of microelectronics maker SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV by selling its 20 percent stake to the other main shareholders. France Telecom said it and CEA Industries were ready to buy that stake and keep French interests at the same level as the stake of Italian companies .

36,"France Telecom said on Monday it had taken full control of Keystone Communications, a major U.S. television uplink company, to strengthen its position in the North American television market.
Michel Combes, director general of France Telecom's audiovisual transmisson activities, said the acquisition for less than $100 million gave the company a prestigious client list of the U.S. majors as well as an enhanced position in Asia.
""The acquisition boosts our position on the North American market where our main rival is VIVX Global Access,"" Combes said by telephone from Cannes where he is attending the MIDEM audiovisual market fair.
France Telecom, through its Telediffusion De France (TDF) unit, is already leader in the European market with a 20 percent stake, ahead of British Telecommunications Plc and has an estimated 15 percent in the world market. Keystone has a 20 percent share of the North American market.
The market for audiovisual transmission -- the service of carrying television pictures from an event or studio to the broadcasting centre -- is estimated at eight billion francs ($1.5 billion) and seen growing by eight percent per year.
The market of broadcasting pictures to the homes, both direct to home as well as to cable company receivers, is also seen at some eight billion francs.
Total sales of the unit are two billion francs.
This market stands to grow rapidly with the take-off of digital satellite television companies.
France Telecom is partner and service provider to the Television Par Satellite (TPS) digital satellite television venture with TF1, France Television, Lyonnaise des Eaux and Luxembourg's Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Television (CLT).
Combes said that while the world market was seen growing by eight percent, this growth was less pronounced in Europe while Asia would increase at a quicker pace.
TDF has a pact with Japan's KDD as well as NHK and is service provider to Hong Kong's television company.
He said France Telecom wanted ""to have a foothold in Asia"" which he called an ""interesting market with good growth potential"" but he declined to comment on whether to company would make an acquisition soon in the area.
""It is increasingly important that you can provide services for your television clients from whatever place in the world, be it for news or sport,"" Combes said.
France Telecom already had a 40 percent stake in Keystone and bought the remainder from Simmons Group. Together with its Maxat British unit, the three companies are now offering international services under the name ""Global Skylink"".
France Telecom, official operator for the 1998 World Soccer Championships, also has a 20 percent stake in TBA in Argentina.

36,"France's Rhone-Poulenc SA said on Thursday its 1996 net income grew 28.4 percent to 2.74 billion francs ($494.9 million), but called this an insufficient level.
Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou denied market rumours the company was on the look-out for acquisitions, sought a merger or planned to split its chemicals and pharmaceuticals activities.
He told a news conference the group would focus on internal growth and he maintained his target of an increase in 1997 earnings per share of 20 percent, before exceptionals, from 8.44 francs in 1996.
Fourtou said the group would in 1997 exceed its planned two-year asset sale programme of 10 billion francs, which stood at 6.8 billion at the end of 1996, and would slash debt to below 50 percent of equity, from 61 in 1996 and 72 in 1995.
Sales were three percent higher at 85.82 billion francs and operating income rose 38.5 percent to 6.892 billion. The gross dividend was increased by 16.7 percent to 5.25 francs per share.
The profit figure was in line with analysts' expectations and Rhone-Poulenc shares closed 0.39 percent lower at 179.80 francs while the CAC-40 blue-chip index was up 1.54 percent.
""This is an encouraging figure, but it remains insufficient for a company of our size,"" Fourtou said about the profit.
He said there were three negative elements in the group's results -- the recall of albumin products at Centeon, a worldwide crisis in polyester which reduced operating income by 700 million francs, and a very low price of titanium oxide which had a 500 million franc negative impact.
Centeon is a 50-50 joint venture between Germany's Hoechst AG and Rhone's 68 percent-owned pharmaceuticals unit Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
Finance director Jean-Pierre Tirouflet said that while the negative effects would persist in the first quarter and perhaps first half of 1997, he saw an improvement in operating results of these activities.
Fourtou said that while improving profitablilty and cutting debt was his main priority, he dismissed rumours of a merger, split-up or capital increase.
""I can confirm we do not plan a major acquisition in 1997. We have never had so many opportunities for internal growth,"" he said. ""I can also confirm that we have no plans for a capital increase, as is being rumored, nor do we envisage a de-merger.""
He said later that his company was not interested in buying Elf Aquitaine's health and beauty unit Sanofi nor in linking up with this company.
""Firstly, as far as I understand, Sanofi is not for sale. But Elf has said it is willing to go below 50 percent,"" he said. ""I want to make clear that we are not interested in an acquisition of Sanofi nor in a link-up with this company.""
Fourtou added that while Rhone wanted better access to the Japanese and other Far Eastern markets, the company had dropped its previous goal of finding a Japanese takeover candidate and was now focusing on joint ventures.

36,"South Korea's Daewoo Electronics staged a charm campaign on Wednesday with newspaper advertisements after fierce criticism about its plans to buy France's state-owned loss-making Thomson Multimedia.
Under a banner ""Do you know the dwarf Daewoo?"", the 34th biggest world company"" the group tried to counter growing resentment in France that a ""tiny"" South Korean company was set to buy a ""leading"" French group for one symbolic franc.
France's Privatisation Commission will state in early December whether it agrees with a government plan to sell defence and consumer electronics Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe for one franc after an 11 billion franc ($2.1 billion) capital injection.
Lagardere will sell Thomson Multimedia, a maker of televisions and video recorders and a leader in digital video technology, to Daewoo.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe, giving in a little to opposition from the Socialist Party and some members of his majority, last week said there would be a parliamentary debate before the final government decision on the deal. But the debate will not be followed by a parliament vote on the proposal.
In full-page advertisements in most French newspapers on Wednesday, Daewoo said that its electronics arm had about the same sales figure as Thomson Multimedia, at some 40 billion francs, although with a profit which the French company lacks.
It said that its global sales network, especially in Asia, would allow better market access for Thomson's new products such as flat screen television sets and televisions that can be connected to the Internet computer network.
The company also said that ""Daewoo believes in France"" and said it had made investments in the country and had close ties with a number of French companies.
""Contrary to all other competitors who have based themselves in or moved to neighbouring countries, Daewoo has chosen France. Simply because it believes in France"".
Parliamentarians of the Communist Party are organising a seminar on the privatisation of Thomson on November 13. They want the promised parliament debate to be televised and joined a call by the Socialist Party for an inquiry commission to study the way the government came to its decision.
The European Commission, meanwhile, is studying the Lagardere bid as well as a rival offer by Alcatel Alsthom and could make its findings on competition issues and the state cash injection known by December 4.
Lagardere finance dirtector Philippe Camus said on Wednesday that a change in the government's decision would be a ""total catastrophe in the international financial community"".
Speaking to a seminar organised by brokers Ferri, Camus said he did not understand the hostility toward Daewoo.
""Daewoo has made commitments on jobs and people say to them, Out! France is going to have a big credibility problem,"" he said.
Camus said Lagardere had had ""37 contacts in the whole world. Everybody ran away from the deal, except the Korean group Daewoo,"" he said. ($1=5.143 French Franc)

36,"Cie Generale des Eaux on Tuesday launched its bid to become the main rival to state-owned France Telecom with the start a fixed-line telephone network in a residential area in this southern city.
""Local telecommunications are for CEGETEL a major strategic axis,"" Philippe Glotin, managing director of Generale's telecoms unit CEGETEL, told a news conference.
He said the group aims to have a market share in 2003 yielding 40 billion francs ($7.9 billion) in annual sales, of which more than half would come from mobile communications.
In mobile telecommunications, Generale already competes with France Telecom with its SFR unit and it is allied to British Telecom Plc and MCI for business services.
SFR expects to have one million customers by March 1997, Glotin said, against some 725,000 at the moment.
The local residential market is expected to grow at a moderate pace but nevertheless represent 55 billion francs in annual sales by 2003.
Glotin said he aimed at gaining a 40 percent share in mobiles, 20 percent in long-distance and 10 percent for so-called local loops, or small networks.
CEGETEL, which counts BT, Mannesmann and SBC of the United States among its owners, has received permission from the French authorities for a telecoms experiment in Nice and from the start of 1997 it will offer residential telecoms services, using DECT technology.
The version of DECT, digitally-enhanced cordless telephone, applied in Nice uses radio waves to connect buildings to a telephone switch while the connections inside the building are of the classical type using a telephone socket.
DECT is also available in totally wireless versions.
The Nice experiment is small, with Glotin expecting 1,000 to 3,000 subscribers by the end of 1997, but it is a precursor of CEGETEL's assault on France Telecom and the company would invest three billion francs in local loops with radio links in the coming years to hone its skills ahead of market liberalisation in 1998.
A DECT service in Paris is expected to be ready in 1998 as the biggest part of an initial series of 30 towns which will add up to a population of some 10 million inhabitants.
In Nice, subscribers pay between 20 and 50 francs per month for a subscription, get a 10 percent discount on calls using the France Telecom network and pay about 0.22 francs per minute for local calls.
The CEGETEL shareholders will inject 6.8 billion francs at the start of 1997 to fund investments. Glotin said that the final make-up of CEGETEL's sharecapital would be known by year-end but he said it would be very close to the October agreement with BT taking 25 percent, SBC 15 percent and Mannesmann 10 percent.
""Changes are within the five percent limit,"" he said.
Glotin said that the success of CEGETEL, or any other rival to France Telecom in France, depended to a large extent on the interconnection costs and other payments telecom operators have to make to France Telecom to use its installations.
Telecommunications minister Francois Fillon has started a wide consultation, set to end on November 30, in order to establish in early 1997 a price list of the services France Telecom can provide to its rivals.
""The level of the interconnection costs for us means either the right to live of the right to die,"" Glotin said.
Another future rival to France Telecom is building and communications group Bouygues which has teamed up with Italy's STET.
"
36,"France announced plans to create a major new force in the world defence industry on Wednesday, by selling state-owned defence and consumer electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe, which owns missile maker Matra.
The government said in a statement it preferred Lagardere's bid to the rival offer of largely civilian industrial group Alcatel Alsthom SA.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe's office said the Thomson Matra giant thus created would be a leading force in the world military industry.
""The merger is an important stage in the reinforcement of the European professional electronics and defense industry,"" it said in a statement.
The government said it would pump 11 billion francs into loss-making Thomson, which is a leading maker of televisions under brand suchs as SABA and RCA, as well as a specialist in defence electronics such as missile guidance sustems.
The decision was a surprise as the stock market and the media had gambled Alcatel's no-nonsense chairman Serge Tchuruk would take the prize over self-made entrepreneur Jean-Luc Lagardere, 69, who is approaching retirement and soon to hand over power to his son, Arnaud.
Lagardere's conglomerate also owns publisher Hachette.
The government did not spell out exactly how it had reached the choice, but its statement stressed the importance of a merger between Lagardere's Matra and Thomson's majority-owned defence unit Thomson-CSF.
It said it was sending both offers for Thomson SA to the independent Privatisation Commission, which has an important say in the sale of state assets, while recommending Lagardere's bid.
After advice from this consultative body, which reviews the terms of bids, and clearance from European Commission, the sale is expected to be concluded before the end of the year.
The government said it would raise Thomson's capital by nearly 11 billion francs, blaming past Socialist administrations for leaving the group undercapitalised after nationalisation in 1982 and for the excessive debts of the early 1980s.
France will keep a golden share to safeguard defence interests, it said.
Thomson SA lost 1.379 billion francs in 1995 and has 25 billion francs of debt. Fully-owned Thomson Multimedia lost three billion in the first half of 1996, but Thomson-CSF is profitable and had 1995 earnings of 1.01 billion francs.
Political sources had said President Jacques Chirac was determined to pick a bidder who kept Thomson's key defence technologies firmly in French hands.
Lagardere has in the past said that British Aerospace Plc, with which is has a missiles joint-venture, and Germany's Daimler Aerospace could also be involved.
The government said Lagardere wanted to leave the share capital of microelectronics maker SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV by selling to the other main shareholders.
Thomson-CSF has a 20 percent stake in SGS-Thomson which is controlled by an Anglo-Italian shareholder group including state entities such as CEA and IRI.
Thomson Multimedia, one of the world's leading television set and decoders makers with brands suchs as RCA, SABA, GE, will be sold to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea.
The government said Daewoo was a well known investor in France and had knowledge of mass production techniques. It said Daewoo has promised to maintain Thomson Multimedia jobs in France and even create new jobs.
Alcatel's shares rose sharply on Thursday morning on market relief. Analysts doubted its capacity to finance the Thomson deal. Lagardere shares were suspended for the day.
On Tuesday, Alcatel closed down 2.22 percent at 444.90 francs on rumours its bid would prevail while Lagardere closed up 2.94 percent at 133.10 francs.

36,"French state-owned Air France said on Thursday it was ready to take on the toughening competition in its domestic market posed by British Airways Plc (BA).
BA's TAT French unit on Wednesday announced a joint 780 million franc bid ($151.2 million) with bank Rivaud for domestic carrier Air Liberte that will double its share of takeoff and landing slots at Paris' busy second airport Orly to 20 percent.
An Air France spokeswoman acknowledged BA's increased presence in France aviation would have an impact.
""It certainly has consequences for us. But we will continue with improving our product and service while cutting our costs and prices,"" she said.
BA, one of the world's most profitable airlines, will in first instance manage its French assets from a distance. TAT and Air Liberte will operate separately at least until 1999 when the latter should have returned to profit.
The Creteil commercial court will meet on Friday to study the BA/Rivaud offer while an Air Liberte creditors meeting has the final say. Such a meeting is due within a month.
But the way to the finish line is not without obstacles.
In Brussels, Richard Branson's Virgin Express said it planned to raise its bid for Air Liberte, in administration since September 26. The court-appointed administrator, Maitre Baronnie, reacted sceptically.
""I have never seen any bid by Virgin so I do not see how they can increase a bid,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
""Strictly theoretically, a new bid could be made just up to the moment that the creditors meet and accept the offer on the table. In the end the creditors decide,"" he added.
The pilot's union of Air France's domestic unit Air France Europe urged the government and chairman Christian Blanc to also make a bid for Air Liberte.
""It will allow our country to remain master of its skies. Otherwise, there will not be any French competition because there will be no French air transport industry left,"" the SNPL pilots union said in a statement.
Air France is constrained from expanding in France until 1997, under conditions imposed on European Commission for state rescue cas.
Air Inter dominated mestic routes and Orly airport until as recently 1995 when the French government decided to open some major domestic routes to competition ahead of full liberalisation from April 1997.
A spokesman for Air Inter, now renamed Air France Europe, said the company had at the moment a 60 percent share on the total French market.
Air Liberte, AOM and TAT have all tried to carve out market share ahead of liberalisation with a price war. As a result they have suffered financially.
Industry sources said Air France could strike back in 1997 and make a bid for AOM to prevent another foreign airline from setting foot in France alongside Brr airlines in France are Air Littoral, owned by the Dufour family, the Dubreuil family's Regional airlines, Xavier Leclerq's Brit Airlines as well as Nouvelles Frontieres' Corsair and Euralair.

36,"The planned sale of state-owned Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics has whipped up a storm of protest which on Monday drove down shares in the Korean company's French partner Lagardere Groupe.
Lagardere shares were down more than five percent at midday on investor worries about the backlash of the Thomson sale that risks clouding the outlook for future French privatisations.
French opposition parties, labour unions and most French people, according to polls, are unhappy with the government's plan to sell Thomson, the world's fourth biggest television set maker, to Lagardere and Daewoo for one franc.
Thomson Multimedia workers protested against the deal on Friday and plan a demonstration in November against what they have likened to an enforced ""fire sale"".
The mounting opposition, and the strongly nationalist tone, could augur badly for foreign buyer interest in future privatisations as the government prepares to sell insurer GAN, Credit Lyonnais and Air France.
The backlash also took the steam out of a rally in shares in Lagardere, which had risen as much as 32 percent after the government announced on October 16 that it had selected it over rival Alcatel Alsthom to buy Thomson Multimedia (TMM)- also a leader in the new digital technology.
""Lagardere is down because of the recent news articles that put in doubt the Thomson deal,"" a dealer said.
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Monday the procedure followed by the government was ""sheltered from all politicial criticism"".
Thomson owns 58 percent of defence firm Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of TMM.
The government tilted toward Lagardere's bid because of the defense connection. Lagardere plans to merge its Matra unit with Thomson-CSF and sell TMM to Daewoo -- also for one franc.
""The public authorities focused on the military aspect of the Thomson deal. They neglected the civilian (consumer electronics) aspect...it's now sticking in their throats,"" said the newsletter La Lettre de l'Expansion.
A survey of 1,004 voters published by the newspaper La Tribune found 72 percent disapproved of the sale price, saying it did not reflect TMM's value. Only 12 percent agreed with the government that the price was right given the group's debts.
TMM is saddled with the bulk of Thomson's debt, expected to reach 28 billion francs ($5.44 billion) by the end of the year.
Loser Alcatel broke its silence on Friday and said it would not have sold control of TMM to a foreign group but put together a 50-50 joint venture with an Asian partner.
""This new group would have formed the basis of a global industrial project in which French interests would have been solidly represented,"" Alcatel said in a statement.
The newspaper Les Echos said in an unsourced report on Monday that Alcatel had also pledged to transfer to the state any capital gain on the sale of part of TMM.
The deal hinges on the approvals of France's Privatisation Commission and the European Commission, and speculation is rising that the privatisation commission -- which had been expect to make only a procedural review -- may turn into a more serious stumbling block.
The commission, a body of seven independent experts chaired by Pierre Laurent, has the mandate to ensure that any deal reflects the value of the company.
""Of course they can disagree with the government,"" a Finance Ministry official said. ""If they agree, the deal can go ahead. If they disagree, the privatisation procedure has to be started over again,"" he added.

36,"French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Monday the procedure followed in the planned sale of Thomson SA was beyond criticism.
France's independent privatisation commission, however, always had the right to block the deal, he added.
""It is my conviction that the procedure followed by the government is unassailable. The law has been respected,"" Arthuis told Reuters on Monday.
""The privatisation commission is an independent body. It has full authority and I cannot prejudge the decision it will take. It is sovereign,"" he said.
Thomson's planned privatisation has raised a storm of criticism in France. The opposition Socialists and Communists in the National Assembly have called for a committee of inquiry into the conditions of Thomson's privatisation.
The French privatisation commission, comprising seven ""wise men"", is currently assessing the value of Thomson SA and its proposed sale to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo Electronics. The commission is expected to issue its decision early December.
Commission members are appointed by decree for five years during which they cannot hold any other function.
The commission is currently chaired by Pierre Laurent, a former section chairman at the country's highest constitutional authority, the Conseil d'Etat or State Council.
Its members are Pierre Alby, a honorary chairman of Gaz de France, Andre Blanc, Daniel Deguen, honorary chairman of bank Credit Commercial de France, Daniel Hua, honorary managing director of bank Societe Generale, Jean Serise and Jean Pineau.
The Bank of France's Francoise Pallo-Guillabert is the commission secretary general.
The commission has the task of determining the value of state assets which are being sold, and to express an opinion about the government's choice.
A spokeswoman for the Finance Ministry said that the goverment always made its preference clear to the commission but sofar has never publicly stated its preference.
In the case of Thomson, however, Arthuis judged it necessary to publish the government's preference to avoid insider dealing because both bidders, Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom, are quoted companies.
There is only one case known where the privatisation commission did not agree with the government -- at the start of 1996 the commission opposed the sale of the state's 83.3 percent stake Radio Monte Carlo (RMC) because it considered the bids too low.
""The first thing the commission has to do is to establish the value of Thomson and see whether indeed it is worth minus 11 billion francs, as both bidders say,"" a ministry official said.
""After that they will have to express their opinion on the government's choice,"" he added.
If the privatisation commission's decision, expected by the end of the year, would be in line with the government's preference there still remain hurdles.
The European Commission in Brussels has to agree with the planned state capital injection of 11 billion francs and has to consider the competition aspects of the deal.

10,"A senior Clinton administration adviser said Friday electronic commerce over the Internet could become the world's largest trade category within the next decade if it did not become over-regulated.
Ira Magaziner, senior advisor to President Clinton for policy development, said in a keynote speech to an Internet Tax Policy Conference here the Internet must remain a free market for electronic commerce to take off.
""If we get the right kind of environment in place, we can accelerate this growth so that in a five- to 10-year time frame, trade across the Internet will actually be more than any other category of trade,"" he said. ""If we do it wrong, we could spend 30 to 40 years trying to undo bad policy.""
The Clinton administration last month proposed a global electronic commerce framework and put forth a draft policy which proposes making cyberspace a duty-free zone, with no new taxes and minimal governmental regulation.
""One of the reasons we wanted to move quickly is we wanted to pre-empt what we saw as bad policy already being thought about,"" said Magaziner, who said he knows of a dozen countries contemplating slapping duties on the Internet.
Magaziner, who organized the task force on health care which failed in its bid to introduce sweeping health care reforms in Clinton's first presidenctial term, said the White House wanted to be ""completely open"" in its developing its initiative.
The draft document is posted on the Internet at the White House home page (http://whitehouse.gov). The administration is collecting responses and hopes to issue a final version of the policy paper in March, the Clinton adviser said.
Magaziner said intellectual property protection was a key issue, along with fair use, liability and privacy, and he said the government's policy towards encryption, which has been sharply criticized here in Silicon Valley, is still evolving.
""We want to preserve the Internet in its somewhat anarchic form...,"" he said of the White House position. ""The economic potential is tremendous, and what we in government must do is make sure we don't mess it up or interfere.""

10,"For many computer owners, 1997 will be the year when Internet users will begin to see more features aimed at making the Net more lifelike. But it is also likely to be marked by frequent communications breakdowns caused, in part, by increased demand.
""I wrote a year ago about a collapse, but it's really collapses, getting more frequent, deeper and longer,"" said Robert Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet computer networking technology and founder of 3Com Corp who is now vice president of technology at International Data Group of Boston.
Metcalfe said the congestion that causes many people to call the World Wide Web the ""World Wide Wait"" is only one of many problems that can prompt it to crash. Major outages have been caused by such seemingly minor events as a rodent chewing a power cable or an ampersand typed in the wrong place in software on central Internet devices.
This summer, more than 6 million customers of America Online Inc., the world's largest online computer service, were without service for 19 hours because of a software problem. In October, a failure at Internet service provider BBN Corp's Stanford University Internet facility cut off access for 400 top high tech firms for nearly a day.
Experts such as Metcalfe predict similar types of outages next year as telecommunications companies and Internet providers struggle to keep up with demand. Still, Web surfers are likely to see many new features in 1997, from advanced graphics to slick ways to communicate with each other using animated characters in virtual chat rooms and high-tech games.
Dozens of companies, including Germany-based Black Sun Interactive, which recently opened an operation in San Francisco, have been developing new virtual worlds based on a technology called Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML).
The technology, pronounced ""ver-mul,"" enables creators of multi-player computer games, for example, to design lifelike characters and three-dimensional settings that will exploit new 3-D computer chip designs and speeded-up microprocessors with added multimedia features due next year. New capabilities include interactive three-dimensional fly-over cities created by the startup Bigbook, which allows users to swoop down on a building and click on it with a mouse to see who is inside.
But as the Net becomes more lifelike, the prospects for a showdown between regulators and free-speech advocates over the issue of online pornography is likely to increase. In October, the FBI said it was investigating an electronic mail message sent to thousands of Internet users offering child pornography for sale.
The question of whether to regulate the content of the Internet, both within a country's borders and internationally, comes as officials in Washington are pressing for reductions in sexual and violent content in film and television. One solution offered by some software firms is a device like television's V-chip, which allows parents to restrict access to certain programmes.
Next year will also see new electronic communities in which people can participate as consumer, customer, contributor or even investor in enterprises over the Web.
Although 1997 will not be the year people rush out to do all their shopping on line, it will be a critical year for deploying the technologies that will make electronic commerce widely available in 1998 and 1999, according to analysts.
Michael Parekh, Internet analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects companies to continue using Internet technology both in internal networks, known as Intranets, and to create what are known as Extranets, to reach customers and suppliers.
""The big thing for 1997 is going to be the way users think of the Web goes from a pull paradigm to a push paradigm,"" he said, referring to the goal of being able to send data to individuals rather than waiting for them to seek it.
In the United States, only about one third of the country's 97 million households have a personal computer and just 11 percent of U.S. households are estimated to have the modem devices necessary to link them to the Internet.
Faster, 56-kilobit modems are due next year, but analysts expect a battle over standards will slow their spread.

10,"Intel Corp. stock fell for the third straight day Friday on concerns that a series of upcoming price cuts could slow the company's momentum.
The stock tumbled $6.75 to $130.50, off a total of $16.125, or roughly 11 percent, since Tuesday.
The fall led the entire market lower, and analysts cited nervousness about Intel's first-quarter results, due after the market close on Monday. The earnings report will serve as a critical barometer of whether strong corporate earnings can keep underpinning stock values.
Industry analysts said Intel's quarterly price cuts on Pentium processors are expected to lead to slightly lower prices for personal computers. Some speculated that in expectation of rival chips, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s new K6, Intel will cut Pentium prices more than usual, from 25 percent to 30 percent.
""This continues to fuel normal PC demand,"" said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc in San Jose, Calif. ""This is the normal stuff that keeps stimulating the market.""
According to First Call, which tracks Wall Street estimates, analysts expect Intel to report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 a share, up from $1.02 a year ago, when Intel posted net income of $894 million on revenues of $4.64 billion.
If Intel meets those expectations, it will be the second straight quarter in which the world's largest maker of computer chips has more than doubled its year-on-year profits.
An Intel spokesman said the company could not comment this close to its earnings report, but the company said in mid-March -- within two weeks of the close of the quarter -- that market fundamentals ""remain very strong.""
Intel executives told analysts in January they expect revenues to be around $6.4 billion, about even with what it reported in the fourth quarter. Gross margins -- the difference between revenue and the costs of goods -- are expected to be even with or below the fourth quarter's 63 percent.
Analysts said Intel's bellwether role -- it has recently made a habit of re-energising flagging stock markets with particularly upbeat earnings reports -- is especially crucial given Wall Street's current moodiness.
Wall Street is particularly wary of the outlook for corporate earnings following the Federal Reserve's March 25 decision to raise interest rates and fresh speculation about chances of another rate increase based on Friday's report of underlying price pressures at the wholesale level in March.
""People are scared. Intel is one of the biggest holdings and they can still sell it at a profit,"" said David Wu, high-tech analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. ""They're scared because tech stocks are going down. If technology stocks can't do corporate earnings, you can forget about the rest.
Analysts said the much-heralded ""whisper"" number for Intel is for it to make $2.15 a share, and that even $2.20 a share could be possible given another blow-out quarter.
But, one analyst cautioned, ""anything less than $2.15 would not be good"" for the market.
Market researcher Dataquest said last week that Intel will continue to dominate the personal computer industry, where its processors currently account for 95 percent of the market, although clone-makers will start to make inroads this year.
Intel spokesman Howard High said Friday the company will continue with its routine quarterly pricing changes, but that he saw no unusual changes in the upcoming pricing pattern from that to which the PC industry has grown accustomed.
""We do our price declines in a pretty predictable, orderly fashion,"" he said.
Analysts expect Intel to cut some prices when it unveils its new high-end Pentium II chip next month, and High said Intel's practice is to ""move other products down a notch"" to make room for the new processors.
""The movement is always in a relatively consistent direction, which is down. The rate is dependent on market conditions ... They (the pricing reductions) seem to have been pretty constant over the years,"" he added.
In February, Intel's pricing changes for its Pentium and Pentium Pro family of microprocessors ranged from no change at all to roughly a 34 percent decline, he noted.
Intel's processors range in price from around $100 for the lower-end, older models to over $1,000 for the highest-end chips.

Just two years after the unveiling of Java, a language for programming computers which began as a tiny project within Sun that was nearly scuttled, it has created an awkward alliance between fierce rivals.
Wednesday's proceedings, to be witnessed by thousands of computer developers in San Francisco, will not be without controversy.
Down the hall from where Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNeally and other Java luminaries will be giving keynote addresses, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates is due to showcase Microsoft's own implementations of Java.
""Certainly the center of the nuclear attack is going to be right here at ground zero in San Francisco,"" Gartner Group analyst David Smith said of the duelling keynotes.  
The pre-conference hype in the industry over the JavaOne conference reached such grand proportions that San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown issued a proclamation designating this week as ""Java Week"" in the city.
Analysts see Java -- which promises to enable programmers to write one piece of software that can run across all computer systems -- as a technology that will eventually creep into pretty much every company's systems.
Sun hopes that by de-emphasizing individual platforms, especially Microsoft's Windows operating systems which are themselves nearly ubiquitous on business and home PCs, it can level the playing field and extend sales of systems like its Solaris Unix platform, analysts said.
International Business Machines Corp. and virtually every other major computer systems maker, including PC industry giants Microsoft and Intel Corp., have clambered aboard the Java bandwagon.
But Gates, who is not used to playing second fiddle, and other industry players over time are expected to vie with Sun for leadership of the growing number of developers entranced with Java, now estimated at 400,000.

10,"USWeb Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Joe Firmage on Monday said the fast-growing Internet services company had launched the second stage of its business plan, agreeing to acquire affiliates in six U.S. metropolitan areas.
Firmage, who started the Santa Clara-based company just 13 months ago, said the second phase of the plan called for the expansion of its corporate-owned operations. He said USWeb would also expand outside the United States, particularly in Southeast Asia and Japan, by the end of October.  
Next year, USWeb will concentrate on profitability, he said. ""In January 1998 the focus is on leveraging what we built,"" Firmage said in an interview in Palo Alto.
He said the company was seeking to achieve economies of scale in the market for services related to building Internet sites and intranets -- internal corporate computer networks that take advantage of inexpensive Internet technologies.
Firmage said USWeb in its first phase succeeded in building a string of franchises in 54 locations in 26 states, including recent affiliates in Austin, Texas., Seattle, Pittsburgh, and Irving and Laguna Hills, Calif.  
The chief executive said USWeb had also succeeded in building a strong name and thus a currency for expansion. A recent study rated USWeb third among information technology executives for brand awareness, behind AT&amp;T Corp and MCI Communications Corp, he said.
Firmage said the company was close to arranging a second round of financing. Last year, USWeb raised $17 million from Softbank Corp of Japan and Crosspoint Ventures, which valued USWeb at $31 million, he said.  
Firmage declined to project the size of any new investment.
By next year, the company's expansion should help USWeb become ""broad and deep and profitable,"" he said, declining to elaborate on expected profit margins.
Firmage said more than 50 percent of USWeb's business was ""the $50,000 to $1 million range of companies setting up business-critical sites for department-sized operations.  
That work, and even much of the business of setting up enterprise-wide sites ranging in value from $500,000 to $3.0 million, is below the horizon of some of the bigger high-technology consulting firms, he added.
Firmage said Internet technologies accounted for an increasing share of the $20 billion information technology out-sourcing market.
The affiliates that USWeb is acquiring are in Washington, San Francisco, the New York City area, Orange County, Calif., Philadelphia, and Milwaukee.
Firmage declined to discuss when or whether the company may consider an initial public stock offering. But, he said, with the current moribund IPO market and declining share prices, ""the private market is the place to be right now.""
Meanwhile, acquisition offers the owners of its franchises a way of creating some liquidity in their holdings, he said.
""There's no question that this does open the possibility of liquidity,"" he said. ""We have a liquidity path.""
USWeb's operations now encompass some 400 to 500 people. The company will hold its semiannual affiliate meeting, known as Velocity, in San Francisco next week.

10,"Wired magazine remains one of the publishing world's hottest 1990s startups, but on the brink of its parent's initial stock offering some analysts are warning the chronicle of the digerati of the Internet age may prove a better read than investment.
""It's a great read, off Wall Street, but the balance sheet is not quite as neo-designed as the magazine,"" said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at Mecklermedia's iWORLD.
The initial public offering of Wired Ventures Inc., the publisher of the magazine, were due to be priced late on Thursday, according to lead underwriter Goldman Sachs.
The offering had been initially due in July but was pulled at the last minute as the market for technology and Internet stocks was tumbling.
Now Internet stocks, most of which have only gone public since the Netscape Communication Corp.'s milestone offering in August 1995, have rebounded nearly 10 percent from their July lows.
Wired Ventures' revised offering has reduced the company's projected market capitalisation by some $200 million, or 42 percent, from its initial plan, according to Harmon, who calculated the company's new market capitalisation at some $300 million based on an IPO price of $13 a share.
Wired intends to sell up to 4.75 million shares at a range of $12 to $14 a share to raise gross proceeds of $61.75 million. This compares with its earlier plan to raise $76 million from sale of 6.3 million shares.
IPO analysts said the company was wise to hold off on its initial offering, enabling it to take advantage of the current pickup in new share offerings coming to market.
Some Internet analysts also said the offering faces a market that is becoming more discerning than in the past, when investors snapped up shares of companies which had minimal operating history and little promise of near-term profits.
""I think they're going to have a little bit of a challenge with this one. It's just fundamentals,"" said one analyst. ""A couple of years ago, when the Internet was just starting, you could have taken your dog named 'Net' public.""
Many investors and analysts compare Wired with traditional print media, since some 90 percent of its revenues are still derived from its high-tech monthly, which since 1993 has been promoted as the magazine of the digital revolution.
Early investors in Wired have included high tech guru Nicholas Negroponte, who heads the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Labs, and publisher S.I. Newhouse.
Wired continues to be among the fastest-growing publishing properties, growing in circulation from 90,000 at the end of 1993, its first year of publication, to an estimated 325,000 in August, according to the company's offering documents.
The company also runs HotWired, a hip Web site geared for those who want to keep on the leading edge of digital developments, and the search engine HotBot.
But IPO experts note the business plan for the Internet operations was still in early development and the company continues to post heavy losses, with a net loss for the first six months of 1996 of $34.7 million, including a $20.5 million writeoff, more than double its revenues of $15.63 million.
At an expected price of some 7.3 times estimated 1996 revenues, the valuation would be cheaper than recent Internet content companies like CNET Inc., which has traded at 20 times 1996 revenues, or Yahoo! Inc., which has been trading at more than 40 times estimated 1996 revenues.
But this is pricey compared to more conventional print media valuations, where two times revenues is often the norm, and four to five times for properties exhibiting strong growth in an otherwise maturing sector, analysts said.
""Wired changed journalism, especially high-tech journalism, and made it cool,"" said Harmon, adding that investors may have difficulty valuing this in financial terms.
""I think Wired expected everybody to just assume it was the emperor emeritus of the digital world and that everything they did turned to gold,"" he said.

10,"Netscape Communications Corp's first quarter results were better than Wall Street's most gloomy projections despite investor worries about sweeping product upgrades next month, analysts said.
Not only did the company manage revenues of $120.2 million in the quarter to March 31, essentially matching more upbeat estimates, but the Internet software pioneer topped analysts' $0.08 a share mean estimate by a penny.
Analysts said company executives appeared confident they will be able to introduce a broad upgrade of its new software within the current second quarter, allaying some concerns the date could slide.
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale told analysts and media by teleconference that the company will hold its third developers' conference in San Jose on June 11-13 and analysts said it will likely ship final versions of its Communicator and SuiteSpot upgrades before then.
""Relative to what was being presumed for the quarter this should be a sigh of relief for a lot of folks out there,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Parekh. ""There was no bogeyman under the bed, as some folks had feared.""
The company told analysts and reporters after the earnings report that sales of its ""client"" browser products as a portion of total revenue declined to 38 percent from 51 percent in the final 1996 quarter.
Server software accounted for 37 percent of total revenue, up from 33 percent in the December quarter, while services soared to $25 percent of revenue from 16 percent.
Compared to a year ago, when analysts noted the company had essentially four products, Barksdale said a total of 15 products had been introduced, upgraded or entered beta testing since January 1.
""We continue to think the market opportunity is significant, and we feel terrific about our product line, particularly our new releases which are in final beta cycles today and which will be released commercially this quarter,"" Barksdale said.
Some analysts expressed surprise at the growth in services revenue, which included greater emphasis on content reachable from its Web site and a fresh focus on growing Netscape's service offerings on their own.
""In my mind it's absolutely a positive, given that they are competing with a software company that is also on its way to becoming a content company,"" said Parekh, referring to Microsoft Corp's media initiatives.
The company was also at the tail end of its Navigator cycle, ahead of the introduction of Communicator, with one analyst saying retail browser revenues fell to two percent from seven percent in the December quarter.
But Netscape retains its share of doubters.
Zona Research said in a report after the results that a dip in overall margins might be a one-time event, but it was nonetheless ""a warning that cannot be taken lightly.""
""Although we believe jackrabbit growth rates are not infinitely sustainable, there is an ominous statistic in today's announcement,"" it said of the margin levels.
On Tuesday, brokers Volpe Brown Whelan &amp; Co. said that though Netscape might report ""a perfectly respectable"" first quarter result on Wednesday, it was entering a period of significantly greater stakes and higher risk.
Two analysts at the firm, Charles Finnie and David Locke, initiated coverage of Netscape with its lowest investment rate, an underperform, setting a 12-month price target of $21 based on comparable valuations.
Netscape faces more substantial risks in the next 18 months than earlier in its short history, the analysts said in a research report, in addition to having drawn ""the unwelcome, and undivided, attention of Microsoft.""

10,"International Business Machines Corp's Lotus Development Corp unveiled the company's next productivity suite, SmartSuite 97, and said the product will begin shipping in January.
Lotus President Jeff Papows said on Sunday night the company will continue to add Internet functionality, with a further upgrade planned in the first quarter of 1998.
He took a shot across the bow of Netscape Communications Corp's aspirations in challenging Lotus's share of the corporate marketplace.
""If they thought the browser war was bloody, just wait,"" he said of Netscape's ambition to expand its role in supplying corporate internal networks, or intranets.
""This will be a whole new level of bloodiness,"" he told reporters after the launch of the new SmartSuite package on the eve of the Comdex annual computer show here, the largest industry trade gathering in the United States.
Lotus executives made clear Lotus plans to continue building new features into its applications suite, while undercutting the prices charged by market leader Microsoft Corp, which dominates the market with nearly 70 percent share.
Although the new Lotus SmartSuite carries an estimated retail price of $399, current Lotus applications users, or those using competing products, may upgrade for just $149.
Those buying the current SmartSuite edition through year-end 1996 will receive a free upgrade and a $50 rebate, bringing the effective price to $99.
Users of certain recent Corel applications packages will be allowed to trade these in for a free CD upgrade to the current SmartSuite for Windows 95 or Windows 3.1 by year-end.
Papows cited a 1996 International Data Corp survey showing the size of the suite application market growing from around $4.4 billion in 1997 to around $6 billion by the year 2000.
Lotus achieved a 26.3 percent share of unit volume in the third quarter, according to IDC data, and has benefited from nine million units sold through computer makers worldwide in the first year of its preloading program.
Online registrations in this program have been rising 600 percent quarter over quarter this year, and retail sales have soared 65 percent, the Lotus executive said.
Lotus aims to differentiate its productivity suite by providing the ability to easily find, share and collaborate, as well as publish, using Internet technology.
SmartSuite 97 works on Microsoft's 32-bit Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems, and permits users to drag and drop Internet information for use on the desktop, dynamically update spreadsheets and conduct searches over the Web.
Lotus product managers also gave previews of Lotus Components for the Internet ""applet,"" due to be released in 1997, to create spreadsheets, charts and diagrams within applications. An applet is a small program, written in the Java environment developed by Sun Microsystems Inc.
Lotus said it currently has some 300 to 400 programmers working in Java -- roughly equivalent to the numbers that Sun's JavaSoft unit itself has had, although Sun now plans to accelerate its number of Java programmers to around 700.

10,"The legal barrage by Netscape Communications Corp. against arch-rival Microsoft Corp. may end up dampening investors' enthusiasm for both stocks, analysts said on Wednesday.
Gary Reback, Netscape's outside counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, has urged the Department of Justice to take immediate action against Microsoft for alleged violations of its 1994 consent decree and antitrust laws.
Separately, Tim O'Reilly, head of Internet publisher O'Reilly &amp; Associates, said he was recently approached by a Justice Department official asking about Microsoft's behaviour, perhaps indicating fresh interest in the matter.
Microsoft, which has weathered legal battles successfully in the past, has rebuffed the allegations, saying Netscape's claims are ""full of wild and unsubstantiated statements.""
The software giant went on the offensive Wednesday, accusing Netscape of failing to live up to its own promises that it would support open Internet standards.
""Netscape should take a good look at themselves in the mirror,"" said Brad Chase, vice president or marketing for Microsoft's Internet division, noting Netscape had blocked users of Microsoft's browser from parts of the Netscape site.
Nevertheless, analysts noted the market has a distaste for legal uncertainty, and investors were likely to start factoring in at least some degree of risk that the battle could escalate into a full-fledged government investigation or lawsuit.
""The legal risk is starting to get heightened on this,"" said Montgomery Securities analyst David Readerman, who covered Microsoft during Apple Computer Inc.'s failed five-year copyright lawsuit against the software giant.
Microsoft also was probed by the Federal Trade Commission and, subsequently, the Justice Department for five years until its July 1994 signing of a consent decree agreeing to alter the way it licenses operating system software.
That accord was viewed by some of its software rivals as having been lenient, and Netscape's lawyer asked the Justice Department in a letter released Tuesday to examine whether Microsoft was now using its control over computer operating systems improperly.
In both cases, analysts noted that the hint of further legal difficulties could dampen further advances in the companies' stocks as the market seeks to sort out the business impact, if any.
""We've been there with the Apple vs Microsoft and we've been there with the (Justice Department) and the experience is that these stocks tend to stall as the market tries to figure out what the risk is all about,"" said Readerman.
Microsoft stock closed up 12.5 cents at $123.50, while Netscape was unchanged at $37.25, both on Nasdaq.
Lawyers in Washington, D.C., said they doubt the Justice Department would find Microsoft had acted improperly, based on the charges leveled against the company by Netscape.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape alleged through its letter to the DOJ that Microsoft had offered ""clandestine side payments"" and discounts on its operating system, and other inducements, to promote use of its own Internet browser.
The lawyers contacted by Reuters noted that while Microsoft dominates the PC operating system market with around a 90 percent share, Netscape has an estimated 80 percent share of the market for Internet browser software.
""In the browser category, Netscape is the elephant and Microsoft is the mouse,"" said Robert Skitol of Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath. ""It's a bit of a stretch to call what Microsoft is described as doing a violation of the consent decree or a violation of antitrust laws.""
"
10,"WebTV Networks Inc. on Wednesday unveiled a new technology it said enables full-screen, television quality video to be delivered from the Internet through conventional telephone lines.
Steve Perlman, co-founder and chief executive of WebTV, said in an interview the new technology will be deployed in upcoming versions of its Internet service, which lets people access the global computer network using their television sets.
The privately held company numbers among its equity investors Microsoft Corp., Citicorp, VeriFone Inc., Times Mirror Co. Inc. and Lauder Partners.
Perlman said the advance, which was being demonstrated publicly for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, speeds download times significantly and greatly increases the quality of video compared with existing systems.
WebTV said the new technology, which it has dubbed VideoFlash, has impressed officials from companies that might use it to show television and movie previews, news clips and advertising and animation through the WebTV Internet service.
Publisher National Geographic, known for producing quality videos and photographs, said the technology was the first to provide acceptable quality video over an Internet link.
""VideoFlash is the first Internet video technology that will allow National Geographic to deliver a visual experience on the Internet comparable to the imagery, drama and depth we offer with our television programming,"" said Larry Lux, vice president of National Geographic Interactive.
VideoFlash can achieve three to 10 times the video compression rates of existing compression technologies, such as MPEG, which itself can compress video data by a factor of around 100, Perlman said.
Even with the fastest modem connections now available, previous technology could take up to half an hour to download a 30-second video clip which could be played on a small window on a computer with generally grainy, shaky quality.
VideoFlash provides much faster downloading and higher-quality display with little perceptible distortion, according to WebTV.
Perlman said the software would be licensed at no charge to content providers to make videos available to WebTV subscribers. He said he expected major suppliers of video content over the Internet to adapt VideoFlash this year.
The technology is software-based and relies on the WebTV reference design, which takes advantage of WebTV server capabilities as well as its proprietary TV set-top box, and will not be available on other systems, at least initially.
But Perlman said he would expect at least one on-line Internet service provider may license the capabilities by the end of 1997.
WebTV terminal units, introduced in September, are currently manufactured and distributed by Philips Electronics NV and Sony Corp.

7,"MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 long distance phone company, said Friday it was in talks to be acquired by British Telecommunications Plc in what would be one of the biggest mergers ever.
Industry analysts said that if a deal emerges, it would send shudders throughout the worldwide telecommunications industry, and present an especially tough challenge for AT&amp;T Corp., the leading -- but struggling -- U.S. phone company.
British Telecom already holds a 20 percent stake in MCI.
No price has yet been agreed upon, a source close to the deal said, but analysts were speculating on $40 a share, which would value MCI at $28 billion, and leave British Telecom with a bill for $22.1 billion for the 80 percent of the company it does not already own.
Washington-based MCI said it expected the talks to be concluded this weekend, although it noted that there were no guarantees an agreement would be reached. ""MCI anticipates that its deliberations will be concluded this weekend and an announcement will be made prior to Monday morning,"" it said.
Analysts said a combination of the two companies would be a good fit in the super-competitive U.S. long distance phone industry, where MCI and No. 3 Sprint have been battling an ailing AT&amp;T Corp.
""This is AT&amp;T Corp.'s worst nightmare. (AT&amp;T Chief Executive) Bob Allen will not get a wink of sleep this weekend,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan, of Kagan Telecom.
""This is an extremely competitive business, and horizontal mergers like this make sense,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisors. ""The economies of scale in this case could be considerable, and the leverage in terms of potential profits is high ... It would be good purchase.""
A spokesman for British Telecom confirmed the British company was interested in a merger with MCI.
A British Telecom-MCI deal would be the largest between a British and American company, and it would rank as the second-biggest ever involving a U.S. company, behind the RJR Nabisco Inc. buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., worth $30.6 billion including debt, according to Securities Data.
British Telecom is aiming to offer a mixture of cash and stock for the 80 percent of MCI it does not own, one source told Reuters. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an announcment was expected on Sunday, if not before.
""If it is true, it would have huge implications for the U.S. market,"" said analyst Ken McGee of the Gartner Group. ""MCI had taken competition about as far as it could go, and needs an infusion of capital for the next stage,"" he said.
MCI has around 20 percent of the $75 billion U.S. long distance market, compared with 55 percent for AT&amp;T. But both are also preparing to enter the $90 billion local calling market.
""It gives MCI an enormous warchest to attack the local markets and defend itself against the regional Bells in the long distance market,"" said analyst Guy Woodlief of Dean Witter Reynolds.
Analysts said British Telecom has a very strong balance sheet and free cash flow, which could help fund the coming multi-front marketing war, from wireless, long distance and local calling to satellite TV, Internet and business data services.
British Telecom suffered a serious setback in September after German utility RWE severed links with British Telecom to join a rival consortium led by Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless Plc. to provide service in Germany.
At the end of September British Telecom signalled its ambitions in the French market through a consortium involving Compagnie Generale des Eaux.
""It would be a good fit for British Telecom and provide a major foothold in this country,"" said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.
In Washington, lawyers and analysts said a deal would likely win approval of U.S. regulators.
""It appears this deal would pass (Federal Communications Commission) approval at first glance,"" said Scott Cleland of the Washington Research Group of Schawb Capital Markets.
An FCC rule adopted last year permits a foreign carrier to invest in a U.S. carrier in excess of a 25 percent cap, as long as the overseas company's home market is open for competition from U.S. telecommunications companies.
Scott Harris, a former head of the FCC's international bureau and now an attorney with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, said that other than the U.S. telecommunications market, the British market is the ""most open"" in the world.
MCI was founded in 1968 as MICOM, or Microwave Communications of America Inc. It was the first company to be authorised by the Federal Communications Commission to compete against AT&amp;T in the domestic long-distance market.
MCI started offering point-to-point private-line service between Chicago and St. Louis in January, 1972, sold stock and was incorprated as MCI Communications in 1973.
The Washington-based company filed an antitrust suit against AT&amp;T in 1974. Six years later, a jury ruled in MCI's favour on almost all counts and awarded the company $1.8 billion, providing a warchest to fund its expansion following the 1982 decision by the Department of Justice and AT&amp;T to break up the giant's monopoly on the nation's long distance industry.

7,"Four regional Bell telephone companies reported strong fourth-quarter results Tuesday, riding a wave of demand for extra phone lines, wireless phones and ""smartphone"" services like caller ID.
Two sets of merger partners -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. and Pacific Telesis Group -- all produced results fairly close to analysts increasingly ambitious expectations.
""These companies have clearly raised the bar on expectations for demand growth. It should be sustainable for 1997,"" said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber.
The Bells have been powered by the mushrooming demand for phone lines to link home computers to the Internet, falling costs of mobile phone service, which has lured more users; and by technology to get more from a phone call -- call waiting, caller ID and call management systems.
Even the companies are surprised by the market's power.
""I'm amazed by how much momentum we have. Frankly, its in advance of our business plans, and its due to both the healthy economy and an overall exploding telecom marketplace,"" SBC Chief Financial Officer Don Kiernan said in an interview.
However, the Bells' stocks continue to be subdued, as investors worry about who will win when regional Bells and long-distance companies follow the lead of telecommunications deregulation and enter each others' markets later this year.
Nynex Corp. said its net income rose 10 percent to $416.5 million, or 95 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $378.7 million, or 88 cents a share, in the 1995 period.
Revenue edged up 0.9 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.30 billion, the New York-based company said. It was reduced by a change in accounting for directory revenues, the assessment of prior-period service rebates and Nynex's decision not to stimulate certain markets while it was in the process of improving services.
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. said its profits, depressed by one-time items, fell to $346 million, or 79 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $392 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion.
Excluding onetime gains and losses, however, Bell Atlantic's operating income rose 7.3 percent to $424 million from $395 million.
""We posted strong gains in our key communications markets in 1996 as we prepare to complete our merger with Nynex in 1997,"" said Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond Smith.
The two companies agreed to merge in April 1996, hoping to create a company with over $50 billion in market value. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March.
For the year, Bell Atlantic earned $1.88 billion, or $4.28 a share, on revenue of $13.1 billion. In 1995, it earned $1.86 billion, or $4.24 a share, on sales of $13.4 billion.
""Both Bell Atlantic and Nynex reported better-than-expected results compared to analysts' consensus,"" said Bill Vogel, analyst at brokers Dillon Reed.
""Bell Atlantic had a very strong and robust quarter. There were quite a few charges in the quarter, but fundamental volumes of the business are at or above expectations,"" he said. ""For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth.""
SBC Communications Inc., parent of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., said its net income rose 4.8 percent to $542.9 million, or 90 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $517.8 million, or 85 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
""Our outstanding financial performance was driven by excellent results by our wire line and wireless businesses, as strong demand and effective marketing led to the addition of a total of 1.5 million customer lines during the year,"" said Edward Whitacre Jr., chairman of the San Antonio, Texas-based company.
Pacific Telesis reported profits of $191 million, or 45 cents a share, before one-time adjustments, down from $233 million, or 54 cents a share, last year. Excluding adjustments, net income rose to $282 million, or 66 cents a share.
The parent of San Francisco-based Pacific Bell said its earnings before adjustments were driven by expanding business in data delivery and new custom calling services, as well as increases in access line and minutes-of-use volume.
Nynex closed unchanged at $50.375, Bell Atlantic fell 25 cents to to $67, SBC fell 25 cents to $52.50, and Pacific Telesis rose 12.5 cents to $37.75, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

7,"Worries about regulatory hurdles and a lengthy 12 months to completion took the edge off market euphoria over MCI Communications Corp's merger with British Telecommunications Corp, analysts said on Monday.
MCI shares were trading on Monday morning just 1/4 firmer at 30-1/2, well adrift of a theoretical value that oscillated around $39 per share, based on the price of BT American depositary shares.  
""The arbs are probably demanding between 15 and 20 percent on this deal because of the lengthy time to closing and the uncertainties of U.S. regulatory approval,"" said analyst Richard Klugman of PaineWebber.
The deal is an offer of 0.54 new American depositary shares in the new combined group, named Concert, for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one BT American depositary share and $6 cash.  
Analysts noted a yawning gap between the value of the deal taken by using BT shares in London and the ADS shares, and a fuzzy debate about how much of the $5.60 BT special dividend should be deducted from the ADS price.
""It depends on what you use as the implied exchange rate,"" said analyst Julie Kennedy of Goldman Sachs. At Monday's one pound equals $1.64, the ADS shares look to be too far ahead.
In any case the final calculations will seesaw with changes in both BT's stock price and the exchange rate.  
Given the broader uncertainties, arbitragers didn't expect to push up the shares to the point where they would have to go over the details looking for the last few cents.
""MCI is trading where is should, in line with BT based on a nine to 12 month transaction, and figuring MCI holders not getting the special (BT) dividends,"" one arbitrager said.
Analysts say the market is not expecting much of the possible buyback of up to 10 percent of Concert shares, which could take place after the deal closes.
Klugman said that though a buyback spreads a given level of earnings over fewer shares, the cost of purchase show up in operating earnings as higher interest charges.
By how much earnings per share improves hinges on how much cheaper debt is than equity, analysts say.  -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610

7,"BellSouth Corp, seeing regional Bells merging around it, feels no pressure to seek a merger itself and sees little value in other deals so far.
""We haven't seen a compelling value proposition in any of the mergers so far,"" chief financial officer Ron Dykes told Reuters.
Dykes said there were few efficiencies in neighboring Bells merging and buying long distance assets was even less attractive.  Competing with Internet service providers was easier and better than paying a premium to buy one.  
As for vertical takeovers, like home security, financial services, software or other firms which are big customers for communications facilities, Dykes was even more blunt.
""It is hard to merge a cat with a dog,"" he said.
By this he meant BellSouth would be much less sure of its footing in a business where it does not have expertise, and management cultures would be very different.
Dykes believes that filling out service provision in BellSouth's huge nine-state region and building franchises for individual businesses is the best way to succeed in the competitive landscape sketched by the 1996 Telecom Act.  
Others have different ideas.
Neighbors Bell Atlantic Corp and NYNEX Corp decided to merge, as did SBC Communications Inc and Pacific Telesis Group, while Ameritech Corp has expanded into home security.
Some analysts believe there are attractive bid targets for regional Bells in the long distance industry, but Dykes said BellSouth doesn't want to own assets of declining value.
""With long distance you are looking at an industry where prices are at their peak.  The same would be true of buying a second tier long distance company,"" he said.  
Dykes believes that long distance rates will fall sharply as companies like BellSouth enter the industry, especially as so much wholesale capacity is for sale.
BellSouth has a deal to use AT&amp;T Corp's network to provide long distance service and expects to be serving customers in at least two states in its region by year-end.
Firms like WorldCom Inc have acquired Internet service providers (ISP's), but Dykes says it is unnecessary.
""In our view it is cheaper to steal the customer than pay for them (by buying an ISP),"" he said.  He said that BellSouth already had tens of thousands of Internet customers.  
""By the end of 1997 we believe we will be the largest Internet service provider in the South,"" he predicted.
BellSouth has worked hard to fill out its wireless coverage, adding new licenses in Federal Personal Communications Services (PCS) auctions earlier this year to its existing PCS and cellular licenses.
It has also bought licenses in other areas in order to swap them for licenses held by other firms in its home region.
On Wednesday it finalised such a deal with a unit of Telephone and Data Systems Inc, trading its interests in 12 licenses in Wisconsin and Illinois for 23 owned by TDS in the South, plus receiving an undisclosed cash sum.
In addition the company has bought licenses for wireless cable which allow it to beam microwave TV signals by line of sight to the homes of viewers. ((-- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610))

7,"Eastman Kodak Co. sees continued innovation as the key to protecting profit margins in a business that becomes more competitive every year, its new president and chief operating officer said Thursday.
""Brand image is fleeting. If you don't innovate ... then that (advantage) goes away,"" said Daniel Carp, who was appointed Thursday to the positions previously held by Kodak Chief Executive Officer George Fisher.
""There is pricing pressure in all products. What happens is that you have to innovate and bring out products at new price points,"" Carp said in an interview.
The Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic giant is counting on new products not only to increase its sales, but also to lift it out of markets where price-cutting is the weapon of choice and into areas where consumers pay a premium for what is new and exciting.
Carp, who was previously assistant chief operating officer and an executive vice president, said Kodak launched 30 new products at this year's Photokina, a key industry show in Cologne, Germany.
Advanced photo systems (APS) and digital cameras are two types of innovation for which Kodak has high hopes.
The APS cameras work with special film containing encoded digital information that allows users to specify different print sizes on the same film and change film rolls half-way through in case light conditions change.
Kodak and long-time rival Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd put aside their long-running dispute over the Japanese market to work jointly with several Japanese camera makers to set standards and develop the APS cameras.
Innovation, Carp said, is increasingly combined with more flexible manufacturing processes so that launches take place with minimal inventory but with a quick follow-up to ensure that strong-selling products do not run out. ""The old way was to build inventory, then launch,"" he said.
Restructuring in such an environment will be a continuous process, he said, with some areas, which he declined to specify, requiring imminent reappraisal on product lines, sales channels or manufacturing processes.
""There are areas of the company that will probably need to have some downsizing going forward,"" Carp said.
He said Kodak would not rule out acquisitions as one way to fill a gap in product lines, but declined to say where he saw Kodak's deficiencies. ""It would give you more strategy than I would want to,"" he said.

7,"GTE Corp. Wednesday said earnings rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosted by strong demand for new phone lines from people setting up businesses or hooking up computers at home.
The results were in line with expectations, but GTE's stock jumped as investors cheered the report from the nation's largest local telephone company, as well a court ruling late on Tuesday that suspended key parts of federal rules designed to foster competition in local phone markets.
Other local phone company stocks also rose after the ruling by a three-judge appeals court panel in St. Louis. The judges said they had ""serious doubts"" about the Federal Communication Commission's authority to impose its pricing policies.
The FCC rules, among other things, would require the Baby Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.
Analysts said state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts. The appellate panel put the new rules on hold while it considers a court challenge to the FCC's plan.
The challenge to the FCC rules had been spearheaded by GTE, which was joined by some of the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators.
""(The legal challenge) improves the probability for getting higher prices to resell local networks than under the FCC guidance,"" said Bette Massick at brokers Bear Stearns.
GTE jumped $3.625 to $42.25 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Other Bell stocks that rose included BellSouth, up $2.50 to $38.875, Bell Atlantic, ahead $2.125 to $60.875, Nynex, which gained $1.625 to $44.50, Ameritech, up $1.75 to $56.125 and Pacific Telesis, which added $1.375 to $34.625, all on the NYSE.
In its report, Stamford, Conn.-based GTE said net income rose to $756 million, or 78 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $695 million, or 72 cents a share, in the 1995 period.
The results matched analysts' forecasts of 78 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates. The 1995 figures included a gain of $11 million, or 1 cent a share, from the sale of secondary telephone properties.
Sales grew 7 percent to $5.34 billion from $5.0 billion.
In addition to strong line demand, GTE cited growth in its cellular and long-distance services.
""The continued pace of our revenue growth, driven by record line growth as well as strong demand for new and enhanced services, is particularly encouraging,"" Chairman Charles Lee said in a statement.
The number of domestic access lines grew 7 percent in the quarter, with more than half the growth in the residential side of the business from additional lines to the home, GTE said.
GTE said its number of cellular customers grew almost 5 percent in the quarter, while cellular revenue surged 15 percent.
It also said it doubled its number of long-distance customers to more than 500,000 from the end of the second quarter.

7,"WorldCom Inc. said Monday it agreed to acquire MFS Communications Co. Inc. in a stock swap worth about $14 billion, creating a giant international business communications company.
The combined company, to be called MFS WorldCom, will provide businesses with local and long-distance telephone, data communications and Internet services all on one network -- something no competitor yet can on a significant scale.
""We are creating the first company since the breakup of AT&amp;T to bundle together local and long-distance services ... controlled by a single company,"" said Bernard Ebbers, chief executive of WorldCom.
The deregulation of the telecommunications industry early this year promises to bring end-to-end service, but neither AT&amp;T Corp. nor any regional Bell can yet achieve it because of regulatory checklists and other issues.
""We think this gives us at least a two-year headstart over our competitors,"" Ebbers said in an interview.
For WorldCom, the fourth largest U.S. long-distance company, the deal will allow it to muscle into business markets that the regional Bells and biggest long-distance providers thought they had to themselves.
For MFS it provides the long-distance connection between its metropolitan circuits that it long needed, and a very healthy premium over the prevailing share price.
The merged company will have current sales of about $5.4 billion a year, with more than 500,000 business customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia.
It will have an end-to-end fiber optic network with 25,000 miles of fiber in service or under construction connecting all major metropolitan areas in the United States.
The merger comes only two weeks after MFS's $2 billion purchase of internet provider UUNET Technologies Inc. was completed on Aug. 12. Monday's merger is expected to close within eight months, the companies said.
Under the agreement approved by both companies' boards, each share of MFS common stock will be exchanged for 2.1 shares of WorldCom common stock. Owners of MSF stock will control about 56 percent of the enlarged company.
MSF's stock leaped $9.75 to close at $44.75 on Nasdaq.
But Worldcom stock fell $3.75 to $22.625 on Nasdaq after the company said the merger would dilute earnings for three years.
Although the transaction was valued at $55.39 per WorldCom share based on Friday's closing price, the steep drop in WorldCom's stock brought the value down to $47 a share, traders said.
""Over time, I think the deal will be viewed very positively, but it will take time,"" one takeover trader said.
Omaha, Neb.-based MFS has local networks in dozens of major U.S. cities, which could help it outflank regional Bells' lock on access to local business customers. This gave it a strong bargaining position in the merger talks.
""He (Ebbers) had the only one sizable company to merge with whose stock we really wanted (to own),"" James Crowe, chief executive of MFS, told reporters.
Despite the substantial stock premium for MFS, savings would soon cover the cost of the deal, Ebbers said.
Jackson, Miss.-based WorldCom said it expects significant cost savings from reduced line and access costs. For example, MFS no longer has to build a $500 million intercity network, because WorldCom already has one. WorldCom will not have to take a share in a $450 million trans-Atlantic cable for its expanding international business because MFS is already a partner in one.
Ebbers said access charges that Worldcom pays to local telephone companies to reach their local customers would drop because MFS already has local lines to businesses in 45 U.S. cities, rising to 85 cities in two years.
Worldcom said in a separate statement that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan to discourage a hostile takeover. It said its move was not affected by the deal with MFS.
However WorldCom could nevertheless be a target for a regional Bell, tempted by the company's long-distance network, said mergers and acquisitions advisor Robert McNamara at consultant Broadview Associates.
""You have effectively put WorldCom into play with this (takeover) move,"" McNamara said.

7,"Citizens Utilities Co. said on Thursday it is aiming to be among the largest eight or 10 U.S. telephone companies by the year 2000 by buying up companies in small but important local telephone markets across the country.
""We are looking at acquisitions of this type every day,"" Ronald Spears, vice president for Citizens' telecom business, told Reuters.
Citizens, currently the 15th-largest U.S. phone company, is looking for new properties on both the western and eastern seaboards, particularly in the South and Southwest, where people are already concentrated or are expected to move.
The Stamford, Conn.-based company is a big stakeholder in wireless telephone firm Centennial Cellular Corp. and owns Electric Lightwave Inc., which provides telecommunications services in five western cities.
To facilitate the growth it needs, Citizens is seeking regulatory changes in the markets where it is the incumbent local phone company, hoping to encourage competitors to come in.
""We want to bring the benefits of a competitive market to customers in the second and third tier markets ..."" he said.
Citizens was to file with New York state regulators Thursday to request price cap regulation for the 250,000 customers it has in upstate New York instead of a cap on its rate of return.
Citizens acquired the business in this area from GTE Corp. in 1993.
If approved, Citizens will also change its New York rate structure, merging local calling areas and making wholesale rates on its network more attractive for new market entrants in a plan it has dubbed ""Customer Wins"".
At the moment it is regulated with a cap on its rate of return, which discourages efficiencies because savings have to be shared with customers.
Price caps instead allow companies to keep their cost savings so long as they meet price targets.
While most regional Bells are being accused of dragging their feet over competition, why would Citizens want to encourage rivals to snare its customers?
The difference, Spears says, is in the type of markets. ""The introduction of competition should stimulate demand in these markets, which is historically what happens,"" he said.
Spears said Citizens would get 85 percent of the revenues as a wholesaler, compared with 100 percent as a retailer -- but the market would be larger and grow more quickly.
Already about 20 companies, mainly cellular telephone providers, are lining up to talk to Citizens about interconnection and resale agreements.
The process is being played out in other parts of the country. Citizens has already moved to price cap regulation in California, Tennessee and West Virginia, and plans to do so in the remaining eight states where it operates as soon as possible.
Citizens Utilities' revenues in the first half of 1996 were up 25 percent at $647 million, with telecommunications the main engine of growth.
This year telecom will account for 65 percent of revenue, and in 1997 near 70 percent, with electricity, natural gas and waste water services taking the rest. Telecom operating margins are a healthy 30-33 percent of revenues.
""We're taking a very aggressive posture for what has been recognised historically as a small independent telephone company,"" Spears said.

7,"British Telecommunications Plc stock and cash share offer is worth between $36 and $39.60 per MCI share at Friday's closing BT share price, MCI chief financial officer Doug Maine told Reuters.
The deal is an offer of 0.54 new American Depositary Shares (ADS) in the new combined group, named Concert, for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one BT American Depositary Share and $6 cash.
BT ADS's closed at $55-1/2 in New York, giving a value of $30 per MCI share plus $6 cash per share before the effect of a buyback by BT which is part of the deal, Maine said.  
BT said Concert will make a buyback of up to 10 percent of its shares after the closing. The maximum buyback would increase the value of the deal to MCI shareholders to $39.60 per MCI share.
""The buyback is very important to us,"" Maine said, adding that it was designed to offset some of the skewed stock ownership patterns which often happen in a transnational merger.
Maine said that the 80 percent of MCI shares held by owners other than BT would translate into a holding of 33 percent in the combined Concert company.  
The terms value MCI at a total $25.2 billion before the effect of the buyback, but as BT already owns 20 percent it need only issue Concert stock and cash worth $20.1 billion.
The new Concert company will have 9.5 billion shares in issue, including 3.1 billion new shares issued for MCI.
Maine said the buyback would be available to all shareholders, and didn't expect problems with U.K. tax law.
British tax complexities have been an obstacle recently to some companies' planned distributions of cash to shareholders in Britain.
MCI shareholders will receive the full BT dividend for fiscal 1998 providing the merger closes before BT's year end of March 31 1998.  Maine said that U.S. shareholders would be as much as 25 percent better off from the dividend proposals.
""A dividend from a U.K. company is worth more to a U.S. taxpayer than a dividend from a U.S. company because of the way the ACT (advance corporation tax) works, and because in the U.K. you don't double tax dividends,"" Maine said.
BT said it is planning a 6.1 percent increase in U.K. dividends for fiscal 1997, but did not give the figures for American Depositary Share dividends.  
Each BT ADS is worth 10 ordinary BT shares, so the 19.85 pence U.K dividend for fiscal 1997 translates to 1.98 stg per ADS, translated into dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the record date in August 1997.
For fiscal 1996, BT paid $2.92 per ADS.  -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610

""Brand image is fleeting. If you don't innovate...then that (advantage) goes away,"" Daniel Carp, newly-appointed president and chief operating officer, told Reuters on Thursday. ""There is pricing pressure in all products. What happens is that you have to innovate and bring out products at new price points.""  
Carp, who was previously assistant chief operating officer and an executive vice president, said that Kodak brought out 30 new products at this year's key industry show in Germany.
Innovation, risky anyway, is increasingly combined with more flexible manufacturing processes, so that launches took place with minimal inventory, but with a quick follow up to ensure products selling well did not run out, he said.
""The old way was to build inventory then launch,"" he said.
Advanced photo systems (APS) are a case in point where inventory judgement has become a more critical issue.  
Kodak and Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd each announced cameras early this year with special film containing encoded digital information allowing users to specify different print sizes on the same film and allowing mid-roll film changes.
Kodak has eight Advantix models, priced between $100 and $500. Carp said a shortage of supplies earlier in the year had now been corrected, but there may be some changes needed to the product mix across the range.
""There may also be some wrong product mix,"" he said, noting that the whole industry was finding demand higher in the mid-range products than expected.  
Restructuring in such an environment would be a continuous process, with some areas -- which he declined to specify -- in need of imminent reappraisal on product lines, sales channel or manufacturing processes. He did not say if jobs would go.
""There are areas of the company that will probably need to have some downsizing going forward,"" Carp said.
In Kodak's main consumer film business, retailers are also increasingly running lean on supplies, or leave inventory management to vendors like Kodak. This makes the crucial Christmas selling season a nervous time.
""Between Thanksgiving and Christmas is a hold-your-breath time. We've had reasonable sell-in (to inventory). It's way to early to get a read on the sell-through (sales from those stores' inventory),"" he said.
Carp said that Kodak would not rule out acquisitions as one way to fill a gap in product lines, but declined to say where he saw Kodak's deficiencies.
""It would give you more strategy than I would want to,"" he said.

13,"Czech paper concern Sepap Group a.s. on Friday said its nine-month net profit fell as a shutdown of its main paper mill, coupled with a downturn in the paper cycle bit into its bottom line.
Sepap said its nine-month net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, fell to 188.4 million crowns ($7 million) from 520.4 million over the same period in 1995, while revenues slumped to 3.94 billion crowns from 5.34 billion.
The firm said results from the third quarter only had stabilised after a first half industry downtrend, though ""the planned annual shutdown of the Steti mill lowered earnings by virtue of the expected higher maintenance costs associated with the stoppage"".
""Overall, Sepap year-end earnings are expected to rise and show a slight improvement over third quarter levels,"" a company statement said.
The Steti mill, which accounts for some three-quarters of the group's revenues and profits, saw its pre-tax profits plummet to seven million crowns.
Comparative figures were not immediately available, but the mill's nine-month 1995 gross profit was some 95 million crowns.
""The market place is sending mixed signals for the fourth quarter. Anticipated price increases have not taken hold at the anticipated levels in all of the pulp and paper grades,"" the statement said.
It added that the group's second biggest subsidiary, newsprint maker ROTO, ""continued to produce good results in a market that is weakening"".
ROTO showed a nine-month pre-tax profit of 149 million crowns on sales of 1.25 billion crowns.
Last year, Sepap was the centre of a heated battle for control between Bahamas-based investor Michael Dingman and Swedish forestry concern Assidoman.
Dingman, who controls 48 percent of Sepap through his Daventree Ltd investment company, won the battle, but later accepted Assidoman's role as a strategic partner in the paper industry. The Swedish firm holds a 39 percent stake in Sepap.

13,"The United States on Tuesday raised the stakes in a battle to supply NATO aspirants in central Europe with advanced fighter aircraft by offering the Czechs free use of seven Navy Hornet jets for five years.
Representatives of the U.S. Navy, on behalf of the U.S. government, offered to lease the Czech Republic seven McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 ""Hornet"" fighter planes under a no-cost, five-year agreement, McDonnell Douglas Corp.said.
Czech officials reacted warmly to the offer, saying the support of the U.S. government was welcome, but that it did not guarantee success for the bid.
""We welcome the U.S. government's support but we will look at all bids. We have experts who will examine all of them and investigate which is the best,"" said Petr Necas, chairman of the parliamentary defence committee after a meeting with U.S. Navy vice-admiral John Allen Lockard.
On offer are six single-seat F/A-18A and one two-seat F/A-18B aircraft currently used by the U.S. Navy.
The offer also includes the supply, at cost, of replacement parts, pilot and ground personnel training programmes and support equipment. ""Supply and service costs will be the subject of further discussions,"" a company statement said.
""The advantage of the lease is that it allows the Czechs to quickly obtain the Hornets, and they would gain almost immediate operational and maintenance experience with these aircraft,"" McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman Barbara Anderson told Reuters.
""As opposed to purchasing, they can take that experience and then make a more sound purchase decision later,"" she added.
Also competing for post-Cold War business in central Europe are U.S. Lockheed Martin, which makes F-16s primarily for the U.S. Air Force, the Anglo-Swedish consortium of SAAB and British Aerospace,, which makes the Gripen, and France's Dassault Aviation makers of the Mirage.
Necas expressed disappointment that governments from other competing countries had failed to step forward formally to lend their support, saying it appeared the U.S. was far more active in the pursuit of a contract.
""I have to say that it's too bad for the Czech side that the activity of the French, Swedish or British governments from the perspective of cooperating (with their companies)...isn't comparable with that of the U.S.,"" he said.
The Czech government, seeking to prepare for eventual membership in NATO, has been debating whether to buy any aircraft as proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading of the fleet.
The Czechs, along with Poland and Hungary, are seen as leading candidates for early NATO membership, when the western security alliance expands.
Czech defence officials have said they have the will but not the wallet to buy brand new Western-made advanced fighters, but are keeping their options open as a battle over the long-term military budget goes on.
They have said they would need about 24 fighters to replace their ageing Soviet made MiG-21s to be more compatible with NATO, but at more than $20 million per fighter, new western planes are too pricey.
Czech pilots could begin training in the planes in six months, with delivery of the aircraft 18 months after the contract is signed, the statement said.
To strengthen its bid, McDonnell Douglas also said that it is preparing to locate component production for the Hornet at Czech Aero Vodochody a.s. regardless of whether new or leased aircraft are chosen to re-equip the Czech Air Force.
Cooperation could also include Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s., the firm added.

13,"Czech telephone operator SPT Telecom a.s. on Thursday said its nine-month gross profit hit 6.0 billion crowns, in line with analysts predictions and likely to have little effect on the firm's share price.
SPT said in a statement that revenues for the first three quarters totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns in total revenues for 1995.
SPT's 1995 full year gross profit was 7.0 billion crowns. All figures are calculated according to International Accounting Standards (IAS).
SPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 on the Prague Stock Exchange on Thursday, though dealers said the results came out after trading ended for the day.
""The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth,"" said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance.
The statement added the number of lines installed accelerated in the third quarter, putting the year-to-date figure at 272,000 lines and the overall installed base at 2.67 million lines.
""The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines,"" the statement said.
SPT, of which a Dutch-Swiss consortium comprised of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom bought a 27 percent stake last summer, is aiming to increase the network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998.
The statement said that investment expenditures for the first nine months totalled more than 20 billion crowns, ""more than the full year 1995 capital expenditure.
""If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned,"" said one local telecom analyst.
Analysts said that the figures would probably not have an immediate effect on SPT's share price, since the entire Czech capital market is in a downturn as investors avoid a market they characterise as plagued with a lack of transparency.
Company officials have been adamant that SPT would not pay a dividend before 1998, as profits would still have to be ploughed back into the network's modernisation.

13,"Senate runoff elections on Friday and Saturday should have little impact on Czech capital markets, as investors focus on macroeconomic fundamentals rather than political influences.
Analysts said last weekend's first round of voting gave a mild boost to the Czech crown and the Prague Stock Exchange, and unless results from the second round of voting on Friday and Saturday vary greatly, little further movement should be seen.
""Provided that nothing drastic happens, it's pretty much a non-starter from a foreign investor point of view. I think that for the markets, it will be pretty much a non-event,"" Jay King, of Wood and Company, said on Thursday.
In last weekend's voting, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) posted a strong result, capturing over 36.5 percent of the national vote, an increase of some six percent from June lower house elections where his coalition lost its majority.
The opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) were second with 20.3 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists.
Only 35 percent of the electorate voted in the elections.
Of the 81 Senate seats, the ODS won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates were to go into the runoff, compared with 48 for the CSSD. In 47 constituencies, the runoff is a straight fight between the two main parties.
Analysts said that with the two main parties assured of dominating the Senate, a body which will have limited powers anyway, little change appears imminent for the country's economic, or political course.
""Our expectation is ODS gaining somewhere around half of the total, and including the rest of the coalition it might be well over 50 seats. I don't think there should be any surprises,"" said Radek Maly, an economist at Citibank Prague.
Following last weekend's vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week.
But dealers said the gains were based more on weak local buying than a change in sentiment from key foreign investors.
The crown too, ratcheted up slightly after the first round of voting, but has since steadied at 2.9 percent stronger than its dollar/mark basket midpoint.
Some analysts said foreign investors might be tempted, as they were the previous week, to play on a strong Klaus victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.
""There may be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown,"" said Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. ""There's no other factor, more or less the basic impulse for that (a stronger crown) was really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets.""
Citibank's Maly added: ""I wouldn't foresee any major changes in the fixed income market. The fixed income market is rather less sensitive to these political events than is the FX (foreign exchange) market.""

13,"The Czech crown, boosted recently by demand brought about by a wave of Eurobond issues, is showing no sign of losing strength, prompting market speculation on Wednesday of possible central bank intervention.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) has said it is monitoring the development of the crown, but is prepared to allow the market to decide its rate within the fluctuation band.
Since the start of 1997 the currency has gained some three percentage points against its fixing basket, mainly on foreign buying to finance a wave of some 30 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) in new crown Eurobond issues.
Analysts said that while the crown may hold steady over the next day or two, it should again test 5.5 percent above its parity level next week.
""I don't expect much of a move higher this week, but next week the crown could again test +5.5 percent,"" said Martin Strauch, a dealer at Citibank.
Jakub Perina of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka added: ""A lot depends on London traders because they are very interested right now.""
The Czech crown is fixed daily at up to plus or minus 7.5 percent of the mid-point of a basket comprising 35 percent dollars and 65 percent marks.
On Wednesday, the Czech National Bank (CNB) fixed the crown at 27.712 to the dollar and 16.846 to the mark, putting the currency 5.05 percent above the mid-point.
""If the crown does not exceed its fluctuation band, the central bank will not intervene,"" CNB Spokesman Martin Svehla told the econoimc daily Hospodarske Noviny on Wednesday.
Last February the CNB widened the corridor within which it fixes the crown each day to plus or minus 7.5 percent of parity, from plus/minus 0.5 percent.
Since then the foreign exchange market, and not the central bank, has been much more of a force in determining the crown's rate within this controlled float.
Several dealers, however, confirmed to Reuters that the CNB had contacted them on Tuesday when the crown hit 5.3 percent above parity, and said they took the move as a signal that intervention was possible whn the currency hit plus 6.0 percent.
""The market was a little spooked by this move, and the crown fell immediately,"" said one London-based analyst. ""But it regained its strength today, and I think many people now expect some intervention if it moves much higher.""
CSOB's Strauch said: ""They (the CNB) could be ready to intervene at some point, possibly +6.0 percent, but it depends on whether it appears to have strength to move even higher at that point.""
The main underlying reason for foreign interest in the Czech crown is the large interest rate differential between the Czech Republic and western countries.
In the middle of 1996 the CNB raised the discount rate to 10.5 percent from 9.5 percent and increased minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent. Interbank money market rates up to three months hover around 12.5 percent.
Though interbank market rates eased some 60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage points, in January, the central bank and government officials have both expressed reluctance to officially lower rates because of strong demand for money and investments.
Analysts said rates are still high enough, howeer, to continue attracting large inflows of capital.

After a strong rise last week, market heavyweights SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka, which together account for almost half of the PX50 index, all fell sharply to drag the index down 0.28 percent to 598.0 points.
""The market has corrected a little bit, but there seems to be good support at this level,"" Marco Anderegg of Patria Finance told Reuters.

""We saw some of the blue chips such as Komercni and SPT rebound in late deals, which could show that the market's weakness will be short-lived. I expect to see prices begin rising again soon,"" said one local trader.
The PSE has been climbing steadily since a slump in the fourth quarter 1996 took 25 percent off the index. Analysts blamed a lack of government commitment to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency for the dive.
The index has gained 9.7 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors.
Bram Buring of Brno Broker Group said the correction could last for several weeks as lower than expected company results began to flood in, possibly taking as much as five percent from the index before it rebounds.
But he added: ""Foreign investors are definitely interested and kick starting the market...We expect that to continue but things have overheated a little at the moment.""
Analysts added that the recent strong performance of the crown should also boost the equities market since investors are shielded from wide currency fluctuations.
The crown has gained over three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks.
In late afternoon trading on Monday it was holding steady at 5.32 percent above its basket mid-point, up slightly from the central bank's daily fixing at 5.28 percent over the mid-point. The crown was fixed on Friday at 5.23 percent above the mid-point.

13,"The Czech Republic has recorded its first budget deficit despite last ditch efforts by the government, which has staked its reputation on fiscal responsibility, to achieve a fourth consecutive surplus.
The Finance Ministry said on Friday that definitive data showed the budget ending 1996 with a deficit of 1.56 billion Czech crowns ($57.28 million).
Modest though the budget may be by Western standards, it was the first shortfall since the Czech Republic became a sovereign nation in 1993 following the demise of Czechoslovakia.
The centre-right government made a final effort to balance the books in December when the budget seemed to be heading for a deficit of more than five billion crowns.
It postponed some spending until 1997, and required early repayment of credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.
Finance Ministry spokeswoman Ludmila Nutilova said revenues for 1996 totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.3 billion.
Ministry officials have said the deficit might edge up even further since more bills might be delivered after the deadline.
The budget has been hampered continually by lower than expected tax revenue and delayed repayment of credits to Russia.
The original 1996 budget was balanced with spending and revenue at 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.
Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the opposition Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome. But he was concerned about the effects that government payment adjustments might have on the 1997 budget.
Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which had been due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the ""alpha and omega"" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus made by the finance ministry soon after the New Year, as a sign of continued fiscal responsibility.
Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.
But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.
Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay.

13,"The Czech December trade deficit should rise to 16 billion crowns ($575 million) from 14.3 billion in the last month of 1995, ending the worst Czech trading year on another sour note, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Friday.
Czech 1996 trade figures are to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Monday.
Most economists surveyed said they expected steady growth in the deficit but few surprises. ""I expect that the figures will be in line with the development throughout 1996,"" Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance, told Reuters.
Whatever the December deficit, the full-year trade gap is guaranteed to be a record given that the January-November figure reached 140.1 billion crowns, already far beyond 1995's record total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns.
Most analysts agreed a 15-17 billion crown December gap, after a 16.6 billion crown shortfall in November, would match prevailing trends and the consensus forecast of a 1996 deficit of 155-165 billion crowns.
The foreign exchange and money markets are expected to show little reaction to the figures -- the worsening Czech trade balance has been long built into crown rates -- as long as the results do not vary greatly from the estimates.
Analysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in western European economies. Effects of a recovery in demand have yet to help Czech exports.
CSU figures consistently show the rate of import growth exceeding export growth, although the gap has narrowed in recent months.
Czech exporters told the CSU in a survey released earlier this month that, among other suggestions, they would want a 20 to 25 percent devalution of the crown against a mark/dollar basket to help boost lagging exports in 1997.
The exporters said that if there were no devaluation of the strong Czech currency, then they expected the government to adopt administrative measures such as higher tariffs and surcharges to regulate imports.
The government and central bank, however, have repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports.
Analysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness.
""There are concerns of the effect this has on the current account deficit,"" said one London-based economist.
""There is a question of the sustainability of the current account deficit. If you have a significantly higher (trade) figure than 15 or 16 billion crowns for December, I think people will get a little bit edgy,"" he added.
The current account ran a deficit of $3.1 billion for the first three quarters of the year, in the latest available figures, spurred by the spiralling trade deficit which stood at the time at $4.1 billion.
Economists have said the current account deficit for 1996, forecast at roughly seven percent of gross domestic product, could be financed in the short to medium term through the capital account surplus and strong central bank reserves.
However, the deficit might start putting pressure on reserves in the second half of 1997.

13,"Czech equity and forex markets pushed higher on Monday, buoyed by a strong showing by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's rightwing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in the first round of Senate elections at the weekend.
But analysts warned profit taking and uncertainty leading up to a second round of voting this weekend will temper gains.
The Prague Stock Exchange, mired in a two-month long slump that has felled the bourse by some 16 percent, jumped 10.1 points, or 2.08 percent, at its daily price fixing to 496.8.
Brokers expressed muted optimism at the prospect that the rise was long-term, saying that domestic investors looking for a quick rise to profit from, and not key foreign investors were at the heart of the gain.
""There is very little foreign institutional buying as a result of the elections. It's mainly domestic buying. This was just the first round and the (vote) isn't won yet,"" said Jan Sykora of the brokerage Wood and Co.
Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings added: ""We had expected some speculation on the outcome of the elections.
Vystavel said the upsurge could continue into next week and beyond if ODS sustains its strong position in the second and final round next weekend, adding that the results may give cause for the long awaited rebound in Czech equities. ""It is quite likely that this is the start of a trend,"" he said.
The crown also strengthened on the back of the election result, gaining around 0.3 percentage points to three percent above its dollar/mark basket in early trading, before settling at around +2.9 percent.
""Some of those who pushed the crown up in early dealing took profits, so its dropped slightly on the index,"" said Petr Korous, a trader at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.
""There will be some bias toward a stronger crown in the coming days but I don't think there will be any major move -- the majority of the move was seen already today,"" he added.
The central bank fixed the crown at 2.96 percent above the basket midpoint on Monday, after fixing it at +2.45 percent on Friday.
In what was billed as a key test of the minority coalition government, Klaus's ODS party took a commanding 36.47 percent of the first round vote, with the opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) trailing on 20.27 percent.
The result was a major improvement for the ODS, which won only 29.6 percent in elections to the lower house in June when a strong Social Democrat performance of 26.4 percent stripped Klaus's three-party coalition of its majority.
The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists.
The strong ODS showing was tempered though by poor turnout as only 35 percent of the electorate voted.
Of the 81 Senate seats, Civic Democrats won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates go into next weekend's runoff.
The CSSD meanwhile, will send only 48 candidates into the second round of voting slated for Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.

13,"Markets across Eastern Europe
remained mired in an autumn slump this week, with analysts
saying they see little impetus on the horizon to break the
bearish trend.
Stock Exchanges in Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest,
Zagreb and Ljubljana all lost ground on the week, while
Budapest bucked the trend, rising slightly though it appeared
to lose steam by week's end.
PRAGUE
Not even a strong showing by the centre-right governing
coalition in Senate elections at the weekend could break the
Prague Stock Exchange out of its current slump, as the PX50
index dipped 0.8 points on the week to close Thursday at 509.3.
Analysts said that while the coalition of Prime Minister
Vaclav Klaus may feel heartened by the showing which gave him a
majority to the Czech upper house, which will have little
power, investors are still put off by poor market regulation.
""I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the
Senate will help bring changes to the market,"" said Pavel
Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka.
""I think there will be a lot of pressure from market
participants on the government to do something...but I have not
seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with
respect to this topic.""
Investors have long complained that market regualtion and
legislation in the Czech Republic is weak, providing little
protection for minority shareholders.
WARSAW
The Warsaw Stock Exchange stayed virtually flat this week
and analysts were divided over the market's direction.
Some said the bourse could extend its three-week horizontal
trend as no fresh signals were in sight. ""We are still in a
horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create
a clear direction for the market,"" said Mateusz Andrzejewski,
an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage.
But others saw the generally positive economic climate as
an impulse strong enough that it could help the bourse climb
above 14,000 points next week.
Analysts said a senior central bank official's comment on
Tuesday on a possible rise in interest rates next year was
bringing some uncertainty to the bourse but was unlikely to
signficantly hurt prices.
BUDAPEST
Hungarian shares, triggered by last Thursday's government
decision to hike energy prices, started off the weekend
strongly, but ran out of steam by mid-week.
Oil and gas company MOL led the charge, but dealers said
its weakening on Thursday could be a harbinger for the bourse.
""MOL turned around today (on Thursday), that is a warning
sign,"" said New York Broker's Kalman Schuszter. ""Sellers are
stronger now."" The BUX index closed on Thursday at 3,674.61, up
3.1 percent from Monday's open.
BRATISLAVA
Slovak share prices continued their freefall over the
course of the week, in a rampant bear market that has seen the
Bratislava Stock Exchange lose about 25 percent since the end
of August.
The 12-share SAX index fell 12.49 points on the week to
close at 161.82 on Thursday.
Dealers said the silver lining to the bourse's woes may be
that prices are becoming so cheap, foreign investors will soon
be lured back.
BUCHAREST
Scant demand kept volumes modest at both weekly sessions in
Bucharest, with turnover low and most prices edging down or
staying flat.
The unofficial VAB index inched down from the previous
session by 1.1 percent to 294.2 points, while the BIG index
eased 1.07 percent to 293.41.
Fertiliser maker Azomures SA dominated trading,
while newcomer, an oilfield equipment maker, put on
a poor show.
ZAGREB
Croatian stocks were mostly lower in dwindling trade and
analysts said they could see no end to the bearish period as
big buyers continue to shy away from the market because of
political developments.
Croatia has been shaken by a wave of strikes, and last week
Zagreb saw its biggest protest in years.
LJUBLJANA
Political concerns were also apparent in Ljubljana this
week, with investors waiting for a new prime minister to be
named, probably in the second half of December.
""The market will be uneasy until it is clear who will form
the new government,"" one trader said. The SBI index fell 6,7
points from MOnday's open to close on Thursday at 1,145.5.
Although the Liberal Democrats of current Prime Minister
Janez Drnovsek were the strongest single party in the November
general election, winning 25 out of 90 parliamentary seats,
they are facing a loose alliance of rightist ""Spring"" parties,
who got 45 seats.

19,"Newspapers in Hong Kong were dominated on Friday by reaction to the death of Deng Xiaoping, with many eulogising his reformist policies that made China, Hong Kong's future sovereign, rich and strong.
""Nobody in the course of this century raised the material standards of living of more people than Deng Xiaoping,"" the widely-circulated South China Morning Post said.
""That, in itself, would ensure Deng his place among the leading figures of the century,"" it said in its editorial.
Little effort was spared as newspapers splashed full-colour photographs of mourners in Hong Kong and China's southern border city of Shenzhen in Guangdong province.
While some papers noted Deng's role behind the military crackdown against 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the issue was not emphasised.
The military suppression had outraged Hong Kong at the time and shook confidence in the territory, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30.
""He deserves to be treated as one of China's greatest leaders,"" the Hongkong Standard said in a front-page editorial.
Deng, who died late on Wednesday at the age of 92 of complications from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection, was widely credited with transforming China from an improverished Stalinist state into an emerging economic powerhouse.
China's economic flowering helped drive Hong Kong, as factories owned by the territory's businessmen mushroomed in neighbouring Guangdong province and Chinese products poured through Hong Kong's port.
Deng also engineered the ""one country, two systems"" formula paving the way for the return of the British colony to China.
""Learn from Xiaoping's merits, actualise the one country, two systems,"" the independent Chinese-language Ming Pao said. ""This is the best way to fulfil his dream...to ensure his vision lasts forever.""
Some papers ran polls, awarding high marks for Deng's achievements. A Ming Pao survey of over 1,900 respondents found Deng scoring 6.4 out of nine for his achievements, while 60 percent thought his death would not affect Hong Kong.
Tin Tin Daily News said a poll of 90 people it conducted showed 85 percent were confident that the one-country, two-systems formula would be implemented.
Normally trim Beijing-backed newspapers Wen Wei Pao and Ta Kung Pao boasted separate takeouts filled with condolence advertisements from companies and individuals.
Perhaps the only discordant note in Hong Kong's eloquent song of praise was an off-colour quarter-page photograph on the front page of the Chinese-language Apple Daily, which it claimed to be Deng's last picture taken while alive in hospital in December.
Photographed secretly through a crack in the door, it showed a wan Deng, with eyes red-rimmed and puffy, staring blankly into space.

19,"China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was greeted by angry protesters on Friday when he arrived to open a historic meeting to choose Hong Kong's future leaders.
Police scuffled with demonstrators when they blocked access to the Convention Centre, where Britain will formally return its colony to China in 228 days' time.
Qian will preside over the 400-member Selection Committee, which began its month-long mission to select the Chief Executive and 60 members of a replacement legislature.
A group of about 30 police surrounded a handful of student activists and herded them towards barricades where other protesters were sequestered. Many had spent the night on a protest fast outside the building.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy lobby has attacked the process and refused to take part in the selection committee which they have branded as undemocratic.
They are adamantly opposed to China's plan to dissolve the elected legislature and replace it with an interim provisional chamber until new elections are staged.
One student was pushed to the ground before being hauled over the barricades into the cordoned-off area by other protesters. ""I am very frightened,"" the university student said. ""I don't know why they pushed me.""
Waving banners and using loud hailers, about 40 demonstrators chanted ""We want a directly elected legislature"" and ""We reject the deterioration of democracy"".
Police flung themselves against the barricades to hold back surging demonstrators, some of whom held up a large black box.
""This is a coffin. It represents the death of democracy and freedom in Hong Kong,"" one demonstrator said.
Members of the Democratic Party had planned to pass a letter to Qian but were unable to get past police lines.
""We hope you would exchange views with Hong Kong people on the setting up of the Provisional legislature and selection of the Chief Executive,"" the letter to Qian said.
The Selection Committee is due to hold a first round of voting on Friday to narrow down the list of candidates to step into the shoes of colonial governor Chris Patten when British rule draws to a close at midnight on June 30 next year.
To enter the final run-off for the job, a candidate must be nominated by at least 50 members of the committee.
Two business magnates and two former judges are regarded as the frontrunners in the race.
The Selection Committee meets again on December 11 to pick the winner.

19,"China, in a bid to boost the its aerospace industry, this week put on what has been touted as the biggest and costliest airshow it has ever held.
""It has been a dream for years for China's aerospace community to host a grand international airshow,"" Liang Guangda, vice-chairman of the organising committee of Airshow China '96 said on Wednesday.
""(It) will demonstrate the great success of China's reform and opening-up and improve understanding between China and aeronautical communities around the world,"" Liang said.
The six-day airshow at Zhuhai airport in southern Guangdong province, which started on Tuesday, is estimated to have cost China 350 million yuan ($42 million), organisers said.
The show brought together 300 domestic and foreign aircraft and parts producers, including heavyweights like Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas.
Held over a 53,000 square metre site overlooking the South China Sea, China put on show its premier jet fighter the China F-8II, and the Russian SU-27 fighter jet, of which China is known to have sizeable numbers.
And standing prominently in the large open grounds was China's space rocket, the Long March Number 2.
The event has been a venue for local and foreign aviation companies to sign joint venture agreements.
Collins Avionics &amp; Communications Division, a unit of Rockwell International Corp said on Wednesday that it signed a deal with two Chinese parties Shanghai Avionics Corp and Shanghai Broadcast Equipment Factory to develop a tracking system, normally used in aircraft, for ships and cars.
They would form a new joint venture company Shanghai Rockwell Collins Navigation and Communications Equipment Co Ltd in Pudong, Shanghai, to develop the product.
The device, called a global positioning system (GPS), can be used to track location, read tide changes and fuel consumption.
China, eager to make the airshow a biennial event, has left little to chance. Work started in May this year, beginning with building of two large exhibition halls and thousands have been recruited to put together the show, organisers said. (US$1 = 8.33 yuan)

19,"In another sign of Britain's slow retreat from Hong Kong before its handover to China, the British army on Friday packed up its radio station -- literally into a shipping container.
Britain departs its colony of more than 150 years at midnight on June 30 and the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) plans to keep broadcasting until the very last moment, but not from its old studio in military headquarters.
In an informal ceremony to the tones of a lone bagpiper, Commodore Peter Melson, chief of staff of the British forces in the territory, declared the new BFBS station open in a standard 20-foot container.
The air-conditioned container sits alongside an office block at the Prince of Wales Barracks on Hong Kong's harbour front and comes replete with disc-jockey, studio equipment and soundproof styrofoam walls.
""It works!"" Melson declared to reporters as he stepped out of the container -- commissioned for use in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War -- after a token inspection.
A staff of 15 who used to occupy two proper studios at the barracks will keep the station going until the handover although ""the shack"", as it is called by its users, itself will be loaded on the supply and troop ship Sir Percivale on June 29.
The extension to the Hong Kong Convention Centre, where the grand handover ceremony will be held, can be seen from container's sole window.
""I'm sure there'll be something in the last hours. It's not something we'll let go easily, not after so long,"" Melson said.
BFBS, with a network of other stations, has operated since 1971 in Hong Kong, where it hit a peak staff strength of 45 in 1990. It broadcasts non-stop news and programmes from Britain.
The British army has been packing up since last year, leaving only a skeletal force just before the handover.
Melson said BFBS has been more than a mere radio station to the garrison in the territory.
""It's meant an awful lot over the years, having our own radio station in Hong Kong. It's something we've been able to relate to, to talk to, have requests from loved ones at home.

19,"Its wheels whirring non-stop, Hong Kong is moving into top gear to prepare for one of the high points in its history -- its return to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 after a century and a half as a British colony.
In a land where people are often too busy rushing about their own business and civil servants too occupied to pay heed to the walk-in visitor, the historic changeover is giving the city a sparkling facelift.
Roads and tiny lanes leading to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the midnight handover ceremony will take place, have been cleared of street-sleepers. In theiur place are pretty potted plants and ornamental iron fences.
Elaborate ""1997 handover"" lighting displays depicting dragons, dolphins and orchids illuminate glassy tower blocks.
In just 12 days, Britain will hand Hong Kong back to China.
As the big night nears, over 4,000 VIPs including heads of state, ministers and officials from all over the world will descend upon the territory to witness the historic flag change.
Thanks to almost 8,000 foreign reporters, specially flown in for the occasion, the event will be beamed to every television set and chronicled in every newspaper on the planet.
Tiny, famously industrious, Hong Kong is leaving nothing to chance.
Hotels have given intensive training to bellboys and chambermaids so they can field, as well as any schoolmaster, tough questions from puzzled VIPs or hustling reporters on Hong Kong history, geography, nightlife and typhoon threats.
At front-line government offices, civil servants seconded to the huge celebration machinery beam from ear to ear as they try to cater to the whims of visiting and local newsmen.
""I'm really impressed,"" a local reporter said as she walked into a press liaison office to get her identification dog tag.
On hand were a dozen staff and she was on his way in under 10 minutes with a stylish sling-bag full of giveaways -- courtesy of blue-chip sponsors only too happy to play a part.
At Hong Kong's top-notch hotels, employees have been given security clearance by police and their best suites, reserved for the VIPs, will be swept clean with bomb detectors.
Anyone up to mischief or with no business at the hotel stands little chance of getting his toe over the lintel, said a public relations manager at the five-star hotel JW Marriot.
""The Hong Kong police is very much involved. From the 28th, guests coming in and out must go through metal detectors, just like in airports,"" manager Peachie Dieken said.
JW Marriot will be playing host to 11 heads of state, and some rooms have even been reserved for police officers during the handover, in case they are needed for any emergency.

19,"Chinese flags flew at half mast across Hong Kong, Thursday morning newspapers were delayed and pupils at ""patriotic"" pro-Beijing schools stood in silence after news that China's patriarch Deng Xiaoping had died.
""Deng Dead,"" screamed banner headlines in Hong Kong's Hong Kong's newspapers when they eventually appeared. All devoted acres of newsprint to the life and times of China's paramount leader, who had wanted to visit Hong Kong after it was reunited with China in July this year.
""Come later. Lots of papers are changing their main sections,"" a newspaper hawker told early commuters en route to Hong Kong's Central business district.
Deprived of reading matter many plugged in their headphones and switched between different Hong Kong radio stations.
Some expressed grief but many inhabitants of the British colony of Hong Kong took Deng's demise in their stride.
""I couldn't sleep well the whole night. He was a great leader of our nation. He improved China,"" said Ko Chiu, 80, who was among a group of elderly practioners of Tai Chi, or Chinese shadow boxing.
But another elderly resident Auyeung Pak, 85, paused from his slow jog in a Hong Kong park to shrug off Deng's death.
""It's normal for a man of that old age. I'm not too sad.""
Chinese flags at China's de facto mission in Hong Kong, the Xinhua News Agency, flew at half-mast.
Pupils at the Piu Kiu Middle School, which follows a mainland Chinese curriculum, observed a minute's silence.
Some analysts have predicted Deng's death will create uncertainty in Hong Kong, threatening stability during its delicate transition to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, 1997, a date now 131 days away.
But there was scant sign of much emotion in the business district.
""It's business as usual,"" said an employee of the state-owned bank of China as he hurried into the bank's futuristic highrise headquarters.
He's lucky to have lived for so long,"" said a 55-year-old women, pausing briefly in her tai chi regime.
A camera-toting Taiwanese tourist, accompanied by her two young daughters, said she did not care.
""I don't feel anything. I heard it early this morning.""

19,"One of Hong Kong's best-known pro-democracy politicians, Emily Lau, was dragged away kicking and screaming by police after lying down on a road to protest against China's methods of choosing a post-colonial leader.
Up to 40 pro-democracy activists scuffled with riot police outside the Hong Kong Convention Centre, where a committee of 400 chosen by Beijing voted for a chief executive to rule Hong Kong after Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight next June 30.
Police said 29 demonstrators were arrested for obstruction and would be released on bail later in the day.
A dozen activists shouting ""oppose the phoney election"" lay down on the road and were dragged away by police.
Lau, an independent democrat fiercely critical of China's communist rulers, was among those carried off, witnesses said. It was not immediately clear whether Lau was among those arrested.
Fellow legislators Andrew Cheng of the Democratic Party and trade union leader Lee Cheuk-yan were also hauled away.
""It's a sad day for Hong Kong. What can ordinary Hong Kong citizens do -- they cannot vote,"" John Wing-ling Tse, a legislator of the Democratic Party, said.
Earlier, protesters erected a ""tomb of democracy"" outside the building and condemned the voting as the end of freedom and the rule of law in the territory.
A panel of 400 chosen by China voted for the future leader. None of the rest of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people had a vote, causing the democracy lobby to dismiss the process as a sham.
Several hundred pro-democracy activists demonstrated on Tuesday evening and 20 diehards camped out overnight with an imitation tomb in front of the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
The first thing in the line of sight when Selection Committee members arrived was the imitation ancient Chinese-style grey arched tomb, constructed from wood.
The structure faced the Hong Kong Convention Centre with the inscription ""Tomb Of Hong Kong Democracy And Rule Of Law"". Candles flickered in the wind beside it.
The committee was convened to carry out the first of two historic tasks -- to elect the man who will step into the shoes of Governor Chris Patten when Britain pulls out. The clear favourite, shipping magnate Tung Chee-Hwa, emerged victorious.
The committee's second task, on December 21, is to choose a provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legco (Legislative Council) on July 1.
The scuffles erupted after police urged the demonstrators, from the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, to move to a cordoned-off area.
Occasionally the group marched a short distance bearing the tomb aloft, as in a funeral procession. In front of the tomb a banner was posted saying ""Death of Hong Kong Rule Of Law"".
""We are against the Selection Committee's so-called election of the first chief executive,"" said Cheng. ""The selection is not real because it is done by Beijing,"" the legislator said.
The protesters brandished a colourful banner with the slogan ""Oppose the False Election Of The Chief Executive, Oppose The Provisional Legislature"" and denounced China for not allowing Hong Kong's electorate to vote.

Top British and Chinese officials on the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a body handling details of Hong Kong's transfer, also said they were confident the matter would soon be resolved.
Beijing's request to have more of its People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops positioned in Hong Kong before the handover emerged last week and was quickly surrounded in controversy.
British officials were adamant there was no question of London agreeing to China's request as the British garrison alone remains responsible till the handover, barely two weeks away.
But on Monday, a top British representative on the JLG said both sides would soon discuss the issue.
""The subject has been on our agenda to discuss and we're continuing to discuss it,"" Hugh Davies told reporters.
Zhao Jihua, Davies' Chinese counterpart on the JLG, told reporters that Beijing thought it was necessary to have more troops deployed in Hong Kong before the handover.
""There is a practical need. It is a matter that needs to be resolved and we hope to solve it,"" Zhao said.
China has said it needs a few hours before the midnight handover ceremony to deploy its main force.
Beijing has already sent an advance party of 200 soldiers to prepare garrison, supply and communication facilities. Britain insisted they be unarmed and wear uniforms only in barracks.
Many Hong Kong people are jittery about the arrival of the PLA as they remember the comunist army's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
But both Zhao and Davies gave no sign whether Britain would concede to China's latest request.
""We've made our position clear already,"" Davies said, but he added: ""I think the arrival of the PLA will take place as around July 1. We're not going to discuss what we're going to be talking about privately on the subject.""
Beijing's request to send more troops and London's clear refusal last week threatened to deepen a rift over Hong Kong's sovereignty changeover.
London, together with Washington, angered Beijing last week by saying they will boycott the swearing-in of a China-backed legislature during the midnight handover party to replace Hong Kong's current democratically-elected chamber.
Beijing has vowed to disband the existing chamber, removing at a stroke democratic reforms introduced unilaterally by Britain inthe twilight years of its rule in Hong Kong.

19,"Hong Kong's pro-Taiwan community flew Nationalist Chinese flags across the territory on Thursday to mark Taiwan's national day for what could be the last time before China takes over in mid-1997.
As champagne glasses clinked amidst the laughter of hundreds of guests, Taiwanese hosts and well-known artistes flown in for the grand event in the posh Regent Hotel fronting the Victoria Harbour, many wondered if they would be able to celebrate in the same style next year.
""We don't know about next year, we have to see how the future Hong Kong government decides,"" Zheng An Guo, general manager of the Chong Hua Travel Agency, Taipei's de facto mission in Hong Kong, told reporters.
Hong Kong, a British colony for over a century and a half, reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. Under its Basic Law, a mini-constitution which takes effect from the handover, is a clause that Hong Kong must observe the ""one-China"" principle.
Communist China regards Taiwan as a rebel province since the Nationalist government fled to the island after losing the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has long sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.
""I'm not sure what the future is for the celebration of the Double-ten event next year but we really want to continue if we can, even (if it is) within some other format,"" said Zhang Su Hui, a Chong Hua spokeswoman.
She added the form of the event next year and the fate of future Hong Kong-Taiwan relations would have to be sorted out through high-level cross-straits negotiations.
Pro-Taiwan sources believe the post-handover authority is likely to prevent flashy celebrations of the event -- known as ""Double-ten"" because it falls on the 10th day of the 10th month -- and to bar public display of Taiwanese flags and gatherings.
While the continued existence of the de facto Taiwanese mission is less in doubt -- so long as it abides by rules -- the raising of the Taiwanese flag, representing clear skies, white sun and the earth flushed with redness of the warrior's blood, would probably not be allowed.
""This is very clear, and the principle is very clear... after 1997, Hong Kong must abide by the 'one China' principle as laid down in the Basic Law,"" said a spokesman with Xinhua, Beijing's de facto embassy in Hong Kong.
Asked if raising of the Taiwan flag after the handover would contravene the Basic Law, he said, ""It should be. After 97, this matter according to the Basic Law would be enforced by the Hong Kong government, the central (Beijing) government would not interfere in this matter.""
"
19,"Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa will unveil on Thursday revised plans to curb civil liberties and rights in the territory after it reverts to China at midnight on June 30, a spokesman from Tung's office said on Wednesday.
The original proposals, announced in early April, restrict demonstrations and ban overseas funding of political parties. They have been revised after Tung launched a three-week consultation exercise seeking views from the public.
""The proposals have been revised after the consultation, considering what people said,"" the spokesman told Reuters.
""We will have a compendium of the thousands of submissions...what sort of responses there were,"" he said.
The revised plans will be announced on Thursday by Michael Suen, a top civil servant recently seconded to Tung's office, and are expected to be made into post-handover Hong Kong laws by the China-backed provisional legislature.
The interim chamber, under China's plans, will itself replace Hong Kong's current elected legislature on July 1.
Tung's plans had long been expected after China's parliament, the National People's Congress, endorsed in February a proposal to change or drop some laws protecting civil rights in Hong Kong.
Tung, the territory's chief executive-designate, argues the intended changes are mere technicalities, needed to strike a balance between freedoms and social order.
But they have drawn a groundswell of opposition from Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp as well as strong criticism from Britain, the United States and human rights groups.
Tung's revised plans were preceded on Wednesday by a fierce debate in Hong Kong's legislative council, with prominent lawmakers condemning the controversial plans.
Independent legislator Christine Loh said Tung had given no basis for his intended changes to current laws that have worked well for Hong Kong.
""The proposals are an invitation to political self-censorship and predictably have a serious, heinous effect on participation in public affairs and an assault on the international character and public spirit of Hong Kong civil society,"" she said.
But a motion, put forward by Democratic Party legislator Cheung Man-kwong, expressing deep regret over the proposals, was rejected by a vote of 27 against 23.
Legislator Ngai Shiu-kit and a member of the pro-business Labour Party argued the proposed changes were necessary.
""Some people have behaved themselves in such a manner in public that have given rise to some alarm,"" he said, referring to a protest last year when a group of Hong Kong activists stormed into the Japanese consulate in a row over disputed islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan.
""If a society is manipulated by such people, then Hong Kong will be embarking on a very dangerous path and that would not be in the overall interest of the community,"" he said.

28,"Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp is in talks with France's Cie Generale des Eaux about taking a stake in its French railway venture, a CGE unit said on Tuesday.
The talks could bring the world's biggest telecoms group closer to one of its keenest suitors -- British Telecommunications Plc.
CGE's subsidiary Cegetel, in which BT is investing 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) to take a 25 percent stake, confirmed the talks after a source close to CGE told Reuters in London NTT was considering a 9.9 percent stake in CGE's railway venture, Telecom Developpement, TD.
""Generale des Eaux is in talks with NTT,"" a source close to the French company told Reuters.
Cegetel, which is France's second telecoms operator and majority-owned by CGE, can take a stake of up to 49.9 percent in TD. But it might limit its holding to 40 percent and seek a minority partner to take the balance, the source said.
BT, with its U.S. partner MCI Communications Corp , has been trying to gain a foothold in the lucrative Asian markets for years as has been openly courting NTT.
Asia remains the last gap in BT and MCI's global jigsaw of deals that span the globe, offering sophisticated communications services mainly to high-margin, corporate customers.
Although BT and NTT are collaborating in a bid to secure the second national licence in Singapore, BT has so far failed to clinch a closer deal with the company in Japan.
The Japanese company, which is looking to make its first foreign investment in a key European market, has been eyeing the 117 billion franc ($20 billion) French telecom market since the summer when it started talks about joining Cegetel, the source said.
Analysts say Cegetel is well-placed to launch as assault on monopoly France Telecom when the market, which is expected to grow to 187 billion francs by 2003, is eased open to competition in 1998.
But Cegetel's partners -- CGE, BT, Germany's Mannesmann AG and SBC Communications Inc of the U.S. -- were unwilling to make place for the Japanese heavyweight by selling part of their stakes in a pivotal European market.
However in February, Cegetel was selected to run a network owned by Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF) via the state-owned rail group's subsidiary, Telecom Developpement.
The move boosted Cegetel's position as second national operator, giving it access to 8,000 kilometres of optic fibre across the country, as well as radio links, which will be expanded to some 12,000 kilometres in the next six years.
It also opened up the possibility of a deal with NTT.
Cegetel, which already runs France's second-biggest mobile telecommunications network SFR, plans to buy at least 40 percent of the shares in TD, leaving up to 9.9 percent for the right strategic partner.
""(Cegetel) can go up to 49.9 percent in a partnership where this partner will be a minority partner,"" the source said, adding that talks with NTT have now centred on this venture.
He declined to divulge how much the stakes were worth.
Although NTT is not the only potential minority partner in talks with CGE, the source declined to name other parties.
""It is quite possible that nothing happens for a year,"" he noted.
Investment bankers expect NTT to be looking to gain a toe-hold in the top four or five European markets and say they would be surprised if efforts are being focused exclusively on France.
The company has not been short of suitors. NTT, which was in December freed by the government to pursue international business, controls virtually all of the local network in Japan as well as having a large presence in Asia.
There are three main global alliances that are eager to link up with NTT; BT and MCI's Concert, Global One; which incorporates France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom AG and America's Sprint Corp and U.S. telecoms giant AT &amp; T Corp's loosely-knit global alliance World Partners/Unisource.

28,"London telecoms analysts are split about the prospects of Britain's Cable and Wireless Communications, the telephone and television cable company that made its market debut on Monday.
CWC started trading, as expected, at around 300 pence per share and rose to 309 pence before edging back to 299.5, valuing the group at around 4.46 billion pounds.
CWC, which was formed last year when the Mercury subsidiary of Cable and Wireless Plc merged with the three cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada, floated a 14.7 percent stake in London and New York.
Brokers Lehman Brothers says a 4.5 billion pound implies an enterprise value of about 6.0 billion pounds, assuming pro forma net debt at the end of 1996 at 1.5 billion stg. The valuation assumes a 700-800 million stg premium to the sum of the parts, assuming a valuation of Mercury of 2.0 billion pounds.
""The timing required to accomplish the technical integration of the various parts as well as the investments necessary to establish the new brand on a nation-wide basis suggest that at 4.5 billion stg, CWC assets are fairly valued.""
With 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure, CWC plans to complete its sophisticated broadband cable and local telephone networks and offer its services to six million customers by 2001.
However, other analysts, such as Richard Jones at brokers Yamaichi and Andrew Harrington at Salomon Brothers, were more bullish.
Jones is recommending buying the stock up to 350 pence per share. Harrington values the shares at 438p and the company at 6.5 billion pounds.
Harrington argues that CWC's network cost structure has a competitive advantage against its main telephony and multi-channel television provider -- British Telecommunications Plc and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.
""It's got 50 percent fewer employees per line than BT,"" he said. ""We think CWC has a unique competitive advantage in the provision of multi-channel TV and telephony. I think it's going to exceed expectations in the next year.""
CWC's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury. Initially, 91 percent of revenues will come from telephony and only nine percent from entertainment, but it will be the first company to be able to bundle multi-channel television and telephony.
Nevertheless, some analysts are cautious about the new company's prospects. Cable television companies have yet to make a profit in Britain's stagnant market.
""On a longer-term view, any valuation becomes almost entirely dependent on your view of what the longer-term penetration rate is going to be for telephony and cable TV,"" noted one analyst, who declined to be named.
He said BT would move into broadcasting by 2001 at the latest, when current regulatory restrictions are lifted, and the group was likely to move into interactive services such as home shopping and home banking sooner.
""Put that alongside the impact of BT's on-going marketing muscle in basic telephony, combined with the impact of digital terrestrial TV and digital satellite TV, and I think that will all serve to put a brake on our expectations of long-term cable TV penetration,"" he said.
Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, says CWC is not worth more than 3.75 billion pounds -- and says his valuation is already stretched.
But Harrington brushed aside these concerns, noting that BT's network will need a lot of investment to upgrade its telephone lines so they can support multi-channel TV and interactive services.
""Everything BT can do Cable and Wireless Communications can to better and sooner,"" he said.

28,"British Telecommunications (BT) and its American partner MCI will ""move heaven and earth"" to link up with Japan's restructured telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), analysts said on Friday.
BT welcomed news that the Japanese government had decided to split NTT into three parts under one holding company as part of its efforts to reach a compromise while liberalising the world's second biggest telecoms market.
""BT...welcomes the news that NTT is to be given the opportunity to operate on a truly international basis,"" a company spokesman told Reuters.
The British telecoms giant, which announced last month that it wanted to merge with America's second biggest long-distance carrier MCI to create Concert Plc, has openly stated that the enlarged group should give it more clout to woo NTT as part of its ticket into the booming Asian telecoms markets.
But he declined to say whether news that Japan will restructure NTT into two regional and one long-distance group would help BT in its quest to link up with the Japanese titan.
""We've always said we'd like NTT to be our partner in Japan,"" he said, but added: ""We can't say whether this makes it easier and better...""
Analysts said that Japan's decision to restructure NTT, the world's biggest telecoms company, had been well flagged and it was now up to BT, MCI and their proposed combined company, dubbed Concert Plc, to forge a deal.
But the difficulty was how to establish partial ownership of an asset in Japan without significant earnings dilution.
""If BT can form a partnership with this new holding company structured NTT -- with access to the international market -- then that's game, set and match,"" said John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
""My feeling is that Concert will probably move heaven and earth try and do a deal with NTT now -- and NTT would probably be crazy to take on anyone else as a partner. Concert has got the product set which everyone wants.""
Taking any significant stake in NTT would not only be hugely expensive but dilute earnings. Foreign companies would find themselves paying a lot of money for few earnings simply because the price earnings ratio of NTT is so high, analysts noted.
""There are still foreign ownership restrictions on NTT which will not be lifted until next year,"" said Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers.
""But we do know BT wants to establish some form of global alliance with NTT, be it in the form of a marketing agreement, some sort of equity swap or a straightforward equity stake.
""I dont think BT knows what it is going to do yet.""
If the creation of Concert wins regulatory approval next year, it will be one of the largest end-to-end telecoms services providers for multi-national companies as the worldwide telecoms market is rapidly being liberalised.
Rivals include French and newly-floated German telecoms groups France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, that have linked up with U.S. long-distance carrier Sprint to form Global One -- and U.S. telecoms giant AT&amp;T, which has set up World Partners with 16 companies.
NTT, which currently is a purely domestic operator with a stranglehold on the domestic Japanese market, has a market capitalisation that at around $120 billion, eclipses all others.
Japan's Posts ministry said earlier today that the NTT restructuring may not be put into place until 1999-2000.

28,"British cable operator Telewest Communications Plc disappointed the market on Wednesday by reporting widening annual losses and telephony and cable television margins that were below expectations.
The group also told Reuters it might delay building out its national network because of heavy investments needed to provide multi-channel digital television and because of its plans to link up its seven franchise areas with its own fibre optic network.
Annual losses before tax widened to 249.9 million pounds ($397.3 million) from 114.67 million pounds while turnover jumped to 290.27 million pounds from 144.78 million, excluding the effect of franchise aquisitions.
Telewest will lose its position as Britain's biggest cable operator after the expected completion in the next few weeks of a merger between Cable and Wireless Plc's Mercury unit and three other cable operators.
The company, which announced fourth quarter and final subscriber figures in January, saw its shares slip three pence to 117-1/2p in slim trade after the results.
Alan Lyons, telecoms analyst at brokers ABN AMRO Hoare Govett said he was disappointed that the company's telephony margins came in at 67 percent and at 42 percent for its cable television operations.
He had been looking for margins of 70 percent and 45 percent respectively. ""That really bodes badly for the business and that's what I'd take as the main bear point from the results,"" he said.
Symptomatic of the growing competition faced by cable firms, Telewest's finance director Charles Burdick said the group might seek to raise more funds for investment plans as fierce price wars keep a lid on margins.
Telewest, which has about 900 million pounds of debt, has secured a 1.2 billion pound bank facility of which it has so far drawn about 100 million pounds.
Burdick said Telwest was considering ""cherry picking"" or slowing down the building of its parts of its national network, which covers 65 percent of the country, in 1998 and 1999 to concentrate on offering digital television as the services comes fully on stream.
Telewest, along with Bell Cablemedia Plc and NYNEX CableComms, has already signed a deal with General Instrument of the U.S. in an attempt to gain the advantage over satellite broadcaster BSkyB in supplying set-top boxes for digital TV and information services.
Telewest, which wants to complete the rollout of its national network by 2000, also wants to link up its regional areas by the end of this year by laying new lines or leasing lines from other operators.
In this way, it can by-pass high interconnection prices charged by dominant telecoms players such as British Telecommunications Plc and Mercury.
Capital expenditure over the year rose 31 percent to 515.6 million pounds and Burdick said Telewest expected to spend a similar amount this year. ""This year will be another year of substantial build,"" he said.
Telewest said average monthly revenue per cable television subscriber edged up to 22.95 pounds from 21.11 pounds in 1995, although average residential telephony revenue billed per line slipped to 20.26 pounds from 20.69 pounds because of a tariff price war with BT.
In business telephony, attempts to remain competitive helped drive the average revenue per line eight percent lower to 54.5 pounds per month.
Telewest, along with other cable companies, has been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications by Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating agency because of slower than anticipated network buildouts and competitive pressures from rivals such as BT and BSkyB.
Higher-than-expected capital expenditure and debt levels and a delay in operating cash flow generation in the industry has concerned the American agency.
But Burdick said Telewest had the best credit rating of all cable companies at BB plus and had had a ""very productive meeting"" with S&amp;P.
""We expect to have a response as a company and industry at the end of the month,"" he said.

28,"LONDON - Shares in British Telecommunications (BT) surged on both sides of the Atlantic on Monday as traders furiously dealt the stock higher in the wake of a $20 billion mega-merger with America's second biggest carrier, MCI Communications.
Analysts said the deal with MCI, which turns the BT/MCI combine into the world's second largest international telephone group with annual revenues of over 25 billion pounds ($41 billion), was mainly welcomed because it would force BT to become more capital efficient by increasing its borrowing.
Weekend news of the biggest transatlantic deal in history, linking Britain's dominant telecoms company with a major American player, also prompted some analysts to reassess BT's growth prospects.
Just under 82.5 million BT shares exchanged hands in London on Monday and the stock ended a sharp 22.5 pence higher at 373.5 pence, having touched 392 pence during trade.
Some analysts recommended buying BT shares up to 400 pence on the back of the tremendous growth prosepects in the telecoms market, one of the world's most rapidly changing industries.
The deal, which creates the world's fourth largest telecoms group in terms of sales after Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT), America's AT&amp;T and Germany's Deutsche Telekom also allows BT to limit its dependence on the heavily regulated British telecoms market.
""This deal will force people to look at BT in a new light; look at the international operations, look at the international alliances in Europe, look at what they could be doing with the Internet because MCI is a big player there,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
""All these much higher growth and much more exciting elements of BT in which the company has been quietly building value will come much more to the fore,"" he added, noting that he was pitching the stock's value at nearer 430 pence.
The merger, which was sweetened with a 2.2 billion pound special dividend for BT shareholders, helps lift the company's debt-to-equity ratio, or gearing, to 65 percent from under five percent.
Analysts have been valuing BT, which had a market value of about 22.6 billion pounds before the MCI deal was announced on Sunday, as a British utility that had about 60 percent of its revenues governed by a regulatory price cap.
But having lined up six European joint-ventures, BT's share of the population in Europe alone for which it may win a licence could rise to 90 million. Armed with MCI, it also hopes to be better placed to win market share in Asia -- possibly with NTT.
""In one year's time, only 15 percent of BT's revenues will be covered by a price cap. And, with their European operations getting off the ground, they will have a very substantial business in international markets,"" said one analyst.
BT and MCI's alliance, dubbed Concert Plc, still needs to win regulatory clearance in both America and Britain.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said that it was still unclear whether the merger, which BT believes will be cleared in about 12 months, would fall under its remit for clearance or under that of the European Commission.
One of the issues that determines which regulatory authority rules on the merger will be the turnover of the new company. However, any EC decision would be made in conjunction with advice from Oftel, the British telecoms regulator, and the DTI.
Most analysts believe that while there are hurdles to the deal, the merger is likely to be shown the green light.
Under U.S. rules, a 25 percent stake limit in U.S. communication companies can be lifted if it is in the public interest. Concert Plc, as a major competitor both in the U.S. and internationally, would help drive down call rates. ($1=.6107 Pound)
"
28,"British Telecom unveiled the largest transatlantic deal in history on Sunday, linking up with America's MCI Corp in a $20 billion merger that catapults it into second place in the world's international telecoms market.
The deal with MCI -- the number two U.S. long-distance phone company after U.S. telecoms giant AT &amp; T Corp -- creates a $54 billion group to be called Concert Plc, which will have 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.  
""Tomorrow begins a new era for all of us as we go forward in Concert and harmony,"" Gerald Taylor, MCI's president and chief operating officer told a news conference as journalists were plied with champagne.
In an attempt to keep one step ahead of rivals as world telecom markets are liberalised, BT is taking on a partner with a powerful position in the world's biggest telecoms market, generating about 40 percent of the world's long-distance calls.  
Under the deal, which has yet to win regulatory approval on both sides of the Atlantic, MCI shareholders would receive up to 2.3 billion pounds cash and new Concert American Depositary Shares. For each MCI share, investors will get 5.4 new BT shares and $6.0 cash, valuing MCI shares in the mid $30 each.
BT is also paying its 2.4 million shareholders a special dividend bonanza of 2.2 billion pounds ($3.6 billion), or 35p per share, which is not dependent on any completed merger.
The company also said it would ask shareholders to approve plans for its first ever share buy-back at an extraordinary meeting to approve the MCI deal.  
BT, whose motto ""It's good to talk"" appears to have paid off since alliance talks failed with British rival Cable and Wireless six months ago, already owns 20 percent of MCI.
Sir Peter Bonfield, BT's chief executive, denied that the deal with MCI was the second best choice for BT, which has been keen to get access to the world's fastest growing telecoms market -- Asia -- via Cable and Wireless' 57.5 percent stake in highly profitable Hong Kong Telecommunications.
""It's not second best, it's first best,"" he told the news conference.  
BT already has a joint venture with MCI called Concert, which provides a whole range of communications services to customers in more than 50 nations. MCI also carries 40 percent of the worldwide traffic on the Internet.
""The merger combines the substantial financial resources and global position of BT with the growth momentum and market expertise of MCI, known for its success in the competitive U.S. long distance market,"" BT said in a statement.  
The new telecoms giant, which will have annual cash flow of about 7.5 billion pounds, will be incorporated in Britain with headquarters in London and Washington and operate under the BT and MCI brand names in Britain and America.
BT expects the merger, after an initial five percent earnings dilution, to yield savings from combining overlapping services of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.46 billion) over the first five years and 500 million pounds pre-tax annually after that.
BT also forecast dividends of 19.85 pence per share for the year to March 31, 1997 -- a rise of six percent over last year -- excluding the 35p per share special dividend.  
BT, which will release full year results on November 14, has declared a half year dividend of 7.90 pence payable in November, six percent more than in the same period last year.
The deal is believed to be the second largest ever involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.
Analysts said a combined company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry, where MCI's major competitors are AT&amp;T Corp and Sprint.
Current market leader AT&amp;T, which would be the hardest hit by a financially muscular new enlarged rival, said on Friday it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government. ($1=.6096 Pound)
"
28,"The global empire of British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp. charged into the vast Spanish-speaking world Friday, leaving them with only Asia to conquer.
In a long-expected move, BT confirmed that flagship Spanish telecoms carrier Telefonica de Espana SA would join its Concert alliance, enabling it to pursue the booming Latin American telecommunications market, which is expected to be worth $60 billion by 2000.
The deal, which was unwittingly revealed by Concert's newest parter, Portugal Telecom, earlier this week, was seen as a blow to AT&amp;T Corp., BT's arch-rival, and heralds a major change in the telecommunications landscape across the Americas and Europe.
In its new deal with Concert, Telefonica is taking a 1 percent stake in BT and BT is taking a 2 percent stake in the Spanish group. Each deal is worth about 280 million pounds ($457 million).
""This is good news although it had been expected in the market,"" said Jim McCafferty, an analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
With a fiber-based network that includes a marine link between Spain and Latin America, the companies plan to establish a state-of-the-art communications portfolio offering voice, data, internet/intranet and video stretching from Alaska to South America.
In a seemingly inexorable journey across the world, Concert now offers seamless global communications services to customers in 41 countries, focusing on high-margin, multinational corporate customers.
The latest deal with Telefonica means that BT, which entered the Spanish market in 1993, aligns itself with a former rival in a key European market.
International telecommunnications groups like Concert are trying to plug holes in their coverage and make up for growth lost in home markets due to increasing competition. But some experts are also stepping up warnings that vast investments abroad might be too risky.
One such investment, which has sparked some concern among the analyst community, is BT's proposed $20 billion merger with MCI. The planned deal, which won overwhelming shareholder support Tuesday, is awaiting regulatory clearance in Brussels and the United States.
BT expects to win final approval for what will be the largest transatlantic merger in history by the fall.
BT says it is in constant talks with telecoms operators in the last, major gap in global geographic jigsaw -- the lucrative Asia-Pacific region.
Concert, which needs to service multinational firms with offices in Japan, has been trying to forge a link with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the world's biggest telecommunications group.
Concert is competing against AT&amp;T-led partnerships such as Unisource and World Partners as well as Global One, an alliance between Deutsche Telekom AG, France Telecom and America's third long-distance carrier, Sprint Corp.
The addition of Telefonica came just four days after BT clinched a strategic alliance with Portugal Telecom that opens the door on South America's biggest market, Brazil.
The Internacional SA (Tisa) subsidiary will manage a new 50-50 joint venture called Telefonica Panamerica MCI, which will dig deeper into the $36 billion South American continent.
Tisa already dominates Latin America's communications with an empire spanning Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Argentina and is well-placed to take advantage of the continuing privatisation trend in the region.
"
28,"Telecoms analysts in London were amused on Monday by Portugal Telecom SA's gaffe in stating that Telefonica de Espana SA had linked up with America's MCI Communications Corp.
Despite Telefonica's denials that a deal had been signed with MCI, the partner of British Telecommunications Plc, most analysts expect a four-way alliance to be announced and said such a deal was already reflected in BT's share price.
BT announced earlier that its Concert venture with MCI was forming a strategic partnership with Portugal Telecom but declined to comment on whether a similar deal had been struck with Telefonica's international arm Tisa.
""I'd say it's a bit of an 'oops' situation and someone has probably got egg on their face,"" laughed one analyst.
Another noted: ""It looks to me a bit like a cock-up for Portugal Telecom."" But he added: ""It is becoming obvious that the four are going foward together. It should be good news.""
Apart from winning exposure to Brazil through today's alliance with Portugal Telecom, Concert has little direct presence in other South American countries.
But a deal with Telefonica's international arm Tisa will add the rest -- the booming markets of Peru, Argentian, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Puerto Rico -- to its growing geographic portfolio.
John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at SocGen, said he would welcome a deal with both Iberian partners because it would ""close the door"" for Concert on the Americas. MCI is already the second largest carrier of international telephone traffic from the U.S. to Latin America.
Because few expect Telefonica to be able to remain in its current alliance in Europe, AT&amp;T -led Unisource, while joining arch-rival Concert in Latin America, analysts expect Telefonica to abandon Unisource.
Without Telefonica, analysts said Unisource would be severely weakened and this could force AT&amp;T to rethink its European strategy.
""The benefit for Concert of joining forces with Telefonica is that they weaken AT&amp;T while at the same time strengthening themselves,"" Tysoe said.
""The more people join in Concert, the less attractive AT&amp;T's option is,"" he added.
Another analyst noted that Telefonica had always been understood to want to be on the side of Portugal Telecom ""so that they don't need to fear that Portugal Telecom will invade Spain and vice versa"".
The analyst, who declined to be named, added that he had expected BT and MCI to take a five percent stake in Portugal Telecom, rather than the 1.5 percent holding they had agreed on.
""You could argue they are now spending their money more wisely and they are not going to invest that much in Portugal Telecom because they need money elsewhere,"" he noted.
Although few believe that Telefonica will allow a partner to buy a stake in Tisa, BT is expected to try to break into the booming Asian markets. Analysts say BT is in talks with most strong players, including the likes of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.
While global telecoms alliances such as Concert fall over themselves trying to plug holes in their geographic portfolios and make up for the growth lost in more mature markets, some analysts warn that not all strategic investments will be successful.
""Overall, it is more important to look at the core business which, for Concert, is the U.S. and UK -- and there, prices will only go one way -- down,"" said the analyst. ""Volumes will presumably also not continue to grow as healthily as they are growing at the moment.
""Perhaps not in the next week or two, but certainly within 1997, people will be much more sober,"" he warned.
BT's transatlatic roadshows should pay off on Tuesday when shareholders are expected to approve the group's planned 12.3 billion pound ($20 billion) merger with MCI.
Analysts then expect the group to stop what one called ""its marketing machine"" and start concentrating again on its operations.

28,"B.A.T Industries Plc said on Monday that its U.S. subsidiary would pay $1.7 billion as its share of a downpayment on a landmark deal between the tobacco industry, legislators and public health authorities.
Amid concern that thorough scrutiny awaits a  controversial U.S. proposal under which tobacco groups could pay $358 billion over 25 years, B.A.T said it might withdraw its support for the deal if it were significantly changed during the legislative process.
B.A.T, whose Brown &amp; Williamson (B&amp;W) unit is the third largest cigarette-maker in the U.S. with brands such as Kent and Lucky Strike, saw its shares slump to close 22.5p weaker at 566.5p.
But most analysts said the deal was broadly positive, and some said the shares could eventually climb to 670p.
Under the agreement, the tobacco industry has accepted tougher regulation on both their products and advertising in return for immunity from big legal claims.
However individual claims can still be brought, albeit under significant restrictions including no claim for punitive damages.
Tobacco companies have also been forced to concede that tobacco is addictive and the money raised by the levy will be used to pay for treating smoking-related illnesses.
Although few analysts said they were surprised at the broad details of the deal, Mark Duffy, tobacco analyst at SBC Warburg, said the settlement was tougher than the market had been originally expecting.
""The share price is valuing (B.A.T's) U.S. tobacco business at nil -- and given that most future cash flows of that business will be going to the U.S. government, then that's how it should be valued,"" he said.
The deal has so far only been struck with U.S. state attorneys, plaintiff's lawyers and public health representatives and still needs to win the approval of the U.S. Congress.
B.A.T welcomed an end to financial uncertainty which has been dogging the industry amid the threat of escalating legal claims by victims of smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer.
""Although B&amp;W remains confident that it would ultimately win these cases, B.A.T's shareholders and B&amp;W's employees should benefit from the removal of financial uncertainty and its replacement with a greater degree of financial predictability,"" the group stated.
The irony of the settlement, according to Duffy, is that the tobacco industry had agreed to a settlement at a time when its recent track record in court was good.
But other analysts welcomed the settlement, saying that although cigarette prices would have to be raised significantly to pass the costs onto consumers, chunky payments by the industry to ward off its foes had been expected.
""Obviously volumes will go down, but that's what we're used to seeing in the UK...but the industry's profits still go up -- although by not very much,"" noted Nick Bunker, analyst at HSBC James Capel.
""I think fair value (for B.A.Ts shares) is somewhere around 650-670p.
But he warned: ""It'll take time. There will be a lot of uncertainty as we go through the whole Congressional process and lots of days when people will panic a bit when it looks like things are going badly.""
Some analysts said they expected B.A.T to turn its attention now to a demerger of its tobacco and insurance businesses in an effort to boost shareholder value.
Simon Willis, analyst at Charterhouse Tilney, said he thought a demerger more likely when B.A.T was trading nearer five pounds rather than six.
Shares in Britain's biggest cigarette manufacturers Imperial Tobacco Group Plc and Gallaher Group, which are facing a string of law suits by lung cancer victims, were also sharply lower on Monday.
Imperial closed at 393.5p, a loss of 13.5p, and shares in Gallaher Group Plc, Britain's biggest cigarette maker, ended 19.5p weaker at 280.5p.

28,"A plan by disgruntled French luxury goods group LVMH to spin off the brewing, food and burger businesses in a planned merger between Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc is winning some analysts' sympathy.
But Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, smarting from having been sidelined in a proposed 23.8 billion pound ($39.2 billion) merger despite his 14.2 percent Guinness stake, has taken the market by surprise.
In two share raids he has snapped up a 6.29 percent stake in GrandMet and spent around 800 million pounds in an effort to leverage a better negotiating position, analysts said on Friday.
He is now the largest shareholder in both of the hopeful merger partners.
A merger between the two British giants to form a new group called GMG Brands brings together an empire stretching from Johnnie Walker and Bell's whisky, Gordon's Gin, Smirnoff Vodka, and Guinness' traditional stount to the Burger King fast food chain, Haagen Dazs ice-cream and Green giant canned vegetables.
Despite some concerns that a hurried sale of unrelated businesses might not get the best or prices, most analysts expect GMG Brands to eventually spin off at least Burger King -- which one said stuck out like a ""sore thumb"".
""The fact is GrandMet has a spirits and food business together and there isn't any clear logical fit,"" noted one analyst, who declined to be named. ""So perhaps on that basis it would seem sensible to spin it off.""
Analysts said the added value in the planned merger, which is awaiting European and U.S. regulatory clearance, was clearly in the spirits division.
But the food businesses are also more than mere chicken feed. Excluding Burger King, they could be worth 5.0-6.0 billion pounds -- on conservative estimates, some said. And that cash could be spent in emerging markets in an earnings enhancing way.
""I think there is added value putting the sprits divisions together,"" noted another analyst. ""By spinning off the other pieces, LVMH...wants to capture as much of that extra value for its own shareholders as it possibly can.""
Separately, credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's  on Friday placed its 'A-1'-plus commercial paper rating of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) on CreditWatch with negative implications following announcement of LVMH's increased stake in GrandMet and its intention to exercise its option to purchase the 34 percent stake in Moet Hennessy owned by Guinness PLC.
S&amp;P said the acquisitions would place further pressure on the French company's existing financial profile, which had already been stretched in 1996 by the purchase of a 61 percent stake in Duty Free Shopping.
It said the move also reflected uncertainties regarding the possibility that LVMH may further increase its stake in GrandMet to obtain a blocking position regarding the proposed Guinness merger.
While Arnault piles up his bargaining chips amid mounting speculation that he may raise his GrandMet stake to 10 percent, U.S. competition authorities requested more information on the planned merger.
The European Commission, which has until 2200 GMT to decide whether to conduct a second-stage probe, is expected to follow suit.
In the meantime, Arnault can convene an extraordinary general meeting if he raises his stake to 10 percent, and put his views to shareholders and the board.
But in order to block the bid, he needs more than 24 percent of GrandMet shares.
While analysts and the companies are braced for LVMH's next move, few believe it realistic to expect the French company to buy such a large stake despite its threats. Such a move would push the price up too high, only to fall back significantly once the bid was blocked, they said.
""I don't think that's a viable strategy,"" noted one.
While GrandMet was holed up in a meeting and unavailable to comment, Guinness said only that as far as it was concerned, it was pressing ahead with the merger.
""We are confident it will go through at the end of the year and we're watching the developments with interest,"" a company spokesman said.
By 1210 GMT, GrandMet shares were trading at 598p, a loss of 5-1/2p, while Guinness stock slipped 6-1/2p to 598-1/2p.

29,"China on Friday angrily denied that its worsening pollution was a threat to the world environment and accused developed countries of concocting the fallacy to monopolise global resources.
""It is rumour and sensationalism,"" the official China Daily said of the ""China environmental threat"" theory. ""It is a cry that the sky is falling when a leaf flutters from a tree.""
China had done more to clean up its environment than developed countries in their initial stages of industrialisation, it said.
Officials announced plans in September to spend up to 320 billion yuan ($38.6 billion) over the next five years to curb pollution and limit damage to the environment.
By last November, the Legal Daily said China had shut down almost 57,000 small polluting factories in a bid to limit environmental damage. Most of the closed enterprises produced paper, fertilisers, electroplates, or extracted sulphur.
It said more than 20,000 environment officials fanned out across China to inspect factories and close down polluting units after the State Council, or cabinet, issued an edict in August to step up environmental protection.
""It is the developed countries that should shoulder the major responsibility of the current condition of world environmental pollution,"" the newspaper said.
""China, at its initial stage of industrialisation, has drawn a lesson from the industrialised countries and has never been willing to sacrifice its environment to develop its economy.""
Even though China's annual per capita income stood at only $400, it was committed to protecting the environment whereas developed countries only began fighting pollution when their per capita incomes hit $3,000, it said.
Factory chimneys across China spew out columns of black smoke, their pipes eject millions of tonnes of untreated waste into rivers and lakes, and a blanket of smog hides the sun above many cities as almost two decades of rapid economic growth have pushed China toward a sink-or-swim market economy.
Some of the world's highest levels of air pollution have been recorded by Chinese cities and acid rain is common.
China, a rising superpower, sees international criticism of issues ranging from its military build-up to human rights abuses as a conspiracy to contain its development.
The China Daily ran a cartoon of a man pointing a finger at a couple who were cleaning their yard and shouting: ""Hey, you dirty the environment!"" while smoke billowed from a chimney in his own filthy backyard.
The newspaper took a swipe at developed countries for polluting the environment, saying they were responsible for emitting 75 percent of the carbon monoxide in the atmosphere.
""The motive for concocting the amazing 'China environmental threat' fallacy is not hard to see through...It is a trick employed by some developed countries to direct people's attention away from reality and to evade their own responsibilities.
""There are those who are unwilling to see China progress and who are trying to contain its development by pointing their fingers at the world's environmental problems,"" it said.
""They hope to maintain the pattern of the past, in which already developed countries continue to enjoy the majority of the world's resources.""

29,"China's propaganda tsars have axed all the novels and two films of controversial writer Wang Shuo, among the earliest victims of a crusade to resurrect communist puritanism.
The state-owned Hua Yi publishing house decided recently to stop publishing a four-volume collection of Wang's 30-odd novels after coming under fire from the Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party, the author said on Friday.
""Someone reported me to the Propaganda Department. They said my works were reactionary...and ridiculed politics,"" Wang told Reuters by telephone.
""They said the taste and the language were vulgar...I do not deny this,"" said Wang, the author of colloquial novels that depict the underbelly of society in Chinese cities and are peppered with strong language and sex.
Propaganda tsars forced Hua Yi to write a self-criticism for publishing such politically incorrect books, Wang said.
""Hua Yi dared not continue publishing my books...No other publication house will dare to publish them,"" he said.
""The decision is very regrettable...I hope this is temporary...Not all my books have problems. I hope they will allow publication of some of them.""
The publishing house and the Propaganda Department could not be reached for comment.
Hua Yi has published about 200,000 copies of the ""Collected Works of Wang Shuo"" since 1992. Wang earns more than 100,000 yuan ($12,000) a year from reprints of his works, about 20 times the average urban salary.
""Reprints each year are my major source of income. It will have a big impact on me,"" Wang said of the ban.
The publisher has not been required to recall Wang's books, but military-owned bookstores have been banned from selling them.
Pirated copies of Wang's works, such as ""I'm Your Father"" and ""Life Fast, Die Happy"", have reportedly now appeared.
Wang is the most prominent victim so far of the Communist Party's crusade to resurrect what it calls spiritual civilisation, communist jargon for toeing the party line that has been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms.
The Communist Party elite ended a four-day, annual closed-door plenum in Beijing on Thursday with a pledge to ""use outstanding works that inspire people to cultivate citizens of a socialist (society) with ideals, morals, culture and discipline"".
Chinese film censors have been dragging their feet on giving approval to the public showing of the movie ""Dad"", said Wang, who directed and wrote the script for the film and wrote the extremely popular television series ""Stories from the Newsroom"".
""Basically, it's done for,"" Wang said of his movie, which was completed late last year. A private film company spent 3.3 million yuan ($398,000) on the film.
Shooting of ""Relations between Man and Woman"" was halted in April because the movie had ""mistakes and too much description of sex"", said Wang, who wrote the script.
The spiritual civilisation campaign has left Chinese filmmakers at a loss and the number of movies shot so far this year has plunged to about 30 compared with an annual average of 160 in the past, a Chinese source said.
Eight movies shot by the state-owned Beijing Film Studio had met the same fate as Wang's films, the source said.
""People don't know what kind of movies can be approved,"" said the source who asked not to be identified.
Asked if he was repentant, Wang said: ""I only have two roads to take. The first is to change my style and write things the government can tolerate and encourage. The second is to do nothing.
""It's very hard to write things the government likes...I will need two to three years to adjust,"" he said.
"
29,"China vowed on Tuesday to intensify a crackdown on economic disorder in 1997, citing tax evasion, financial irregularities, smuggling and counterfeiting as some ills that cost the state billions of dollars a year.
""Basically, the situation of economic disorder still has not changed. Some problems are even considerably serious,"" the official People's Daily said in a commentary.
Chinese authorities uncovered tax, auditing and pricing violations valued at 161 billion yuan ($19.4 billion) in the past 11 years, or an average of 14.6 billion yuan a year, the commentary said.
""Increasing the intensity of regulating and revamping economic order has become an important mission which brooks no delay,"" the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party said.
""We cannot be soft when dealing a blow to various economic crimes,"" the commentary said.
Tax evasion and smuggling were now rife, springing up along with market-oriented economic reforms introduced by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s.
State media said taxpayers had evaded personal income tax worth an estimated 12 billion yuan since the tax was introduced in 1980.
Up to 60 percent of state-run or collective firms in China evaded taxes, the media said. It gave no figures.
""Many enterprises have two sets of accounting books and fabricate financial statements, budgets, sales and asset appraisal,"" the commentary said.
Chinese companies owed 35.7 billion yuan in industrial and commercial taxes in the first 11 months of 1996, up 72.9 percent from the year-ago period, Xinhua news agency said.
Beijing collected 563.9 billion yuan in industrial and commercial taxes in the first 11 months, up 1995 percent from the year-ago period.
Smuggling of goods, ranging from drugs to stolen cars, was rampant in China's thriving and porous coastal areas and inland border regions.
Chinese customs seized 5.6 billion yuan worth of smuggled goods in the first six months of 1996, latest figures showed. No comparative figures were available.
Cheng Xiusheng, an economist with the Development Research Centre under the cabinet, said economic disorder was inevitable as China abandoned central planning and embraced market reforms.
The authorities have reined in galloping inflation, allowing them to now turn their attention to restoring economic order, Cheng said.
""It can be said that inflation is under control... The next step is to revamp economic order,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
The People's Daily said financial irregularities, including financial institutions paying exorbitant interest rates and extending huge loans to loss-making state-owned enterprises, have been ""repeatedly banned but do not stop"".
Counterfeiting and piracy were common and almost led to a trade war between China and the United States in February 1995 and June this year. China has declared war on piracy and clamped down on manufacturers of pirated compact discs.

29,"A Chinese court has jailed a 56-year-old dissident for five years for subversion, dealing another blow to the country's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
The Intermediate People's Court in Xi'an city, in the northern province of Shaanxi, convicted Zhang Zong'ai this week of spreading ""counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement"", his lawyer, Zhang Jiankang, said on Saturday.
The dissident, detained since June, has appealed to the Shaanxi provincial Higher People's Court, the Hong Kong-based Human Rights and Democracy in China Information Centre said.
""Their (Chinese authorities) intention is to kill the chicken for the monkey to see... to frighten other dissidents,"" a spokesman for the centre, which monitors human rights abuses in China, said in a telephone interview.
Zhang was previously jailed for five years for demanding Premier Li Peng be impeached for ordering the military to crush student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989, the human rights watchdog said.
He lost his seat in the local lawmaking body along with his teaching job at the Xi'an Institute of Statistics and his wife divorced him after his incarceration in 1989, his family said.
Asked to comment on Zhang's latest conviction, his sister, Zhang Xin, said he was innocent.
""He was wrongly accused,"" the sister said by telephone. ""He didn't commit any crime... He didn't do anything.""
His lawyer told Reuters the court had found Zhang guilty of attacking China's judiciary in an interview with former student leader Wang Dan that was later published in a Hong Kong newspaper.
Wang, a former student leader of the 1989 democracy demonstrations, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government.
The court also found Zhang guilty of signing a petition last year urging authorities to show political tolerance, the lawyer said.
The court cleared Zhang of any wrongdoing in accepting money from an overseas group, the lawyer said. The court ruled Zhang did accept money but that he did not use the funds for counter-revolutionary activities.
The lawyer said the verdict also did not mention a charge in the bill of indictment that accused Zhang of ""pledging loyalty"" to the Taiwan authorities by writing to General Wego Chiang.
Chiang is the sole surviving son of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province.
The dissident had not mailed a letter to Chiang that was found in his home in Xi'an.
Beijing's Communists and Taipei's Nationalists have been political rivals for almost five decades.
In recent months, the Chinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the struggling democracy movement.
Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.
China dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.
Three pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei, capital of the central province of Anhui.
In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that neighbours Hong Kong, two labour activists are standing trial for conspiring to subvert the government.
"
29,"China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, reported to be in fragile health, was absent from a rally on Tuesday to pay tribute to him and other survivors of the 1934-36 Long March.
Deng, 92, one of about 700 surviving veterans of the Red Army who trekked 9,650 km (6,000 miles) across China on foot to flee Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops, did not appear on state television which showed the 45-minute rally live.
Deng, who no longer holds any office but is believed to remain highly influential, has not been seen in public since early 1994.
His health is a matter of intense speculation in China, Hong Kong and the Asian region because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.
The official line is that Deng is in good health for a man of his age.
Extensive preparations were made last year for Deng to grace official celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the World War Two victory against Japan, but his scheduled appearance was cancelled at the last minute, Chinese sources said.
The Long March rally was seen by some analysts as a show of support for Deng's successor, Communist Party boss and state president Jiang Zemin, who has been eager to shrug off the patriarch's shadow.
""It was staged to show Jiang has the support of military from the old to the present and future generations,"" one Chinese analyst said.
Long March survivors, including former state president and Jiang's bitter rival Yang Shangkun, were at the rally. A representative of the three million-strong People's Liberation Army pledged to follow Jiang's leadership.
Eight Young Pioneers -- China's version of boy and girl scouts -- recited poems at the rally at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing adjacent to Tiananmen Square.
Wearing his trademark army uniform with no stars or stripes, Jiang urged the ruling Communist Party to inherit the spirit of the Long March.
""The spirit of the Long March...is a strong spiritual force that guarantees our walking from victory to victory,"" Jiang said, reading from a prepared statement.
The gruelling Long March slashed the Red Army's numbers to about 7,000 from 100,000, but survivors were hardened and went on to defeat and drive Chiang and his troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
""The road after the revolution is even longer and the work greater and tougher,"" Jiang said.
Jiang has declared war on crime, corruption and poverty -- problems plaguing China today -- and embarked on a crusade to resurrect socialist ethics, which have been eroded by almost two decades of economic reforms.
He paid little tribute to his mentor, mentioning Deng only twice in his lengthy speech.
The People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, splashed on its front page a photograph showing portraits of Jiang, Deng and chairman Mao Zedong hanging over a cultural performance on Monday evening to mark the anniversary.

29,"A group of foreign legal experts has asked China for permission to observe next week's trial of detained dissident Wang Dan, a human rights group said on Saturday.
Wang faces the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison.
The legal team consists of French senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys-general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said.
""The request ... is in part to see whether the right of Wang Dan to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal ... is respected,"" the human rights group said.
Wang, 26, who vanished into detention in May 1995, would plead not guilty at his Beijing Intermediate People's Court trial which opens on Wednesday, family members have said.
The human rights group said the chances of China allowing the foreign legal experts to observe the trial were slim. ""Admittance to the courtroom is often denied to ... journalists and other 'outsiders' on grounds that the courtroom is 'too small',"" Human Rights Watch said.
Wang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister have been allowed to sit in.
The court has refused to give details of Wang's trial other than the fact that he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government, but one official has said Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.
Wang's mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, though she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention.
Human Rights Watch was not optimistic about an acquittal. ""He has not had adequate time to prepare a defence,"" it said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile.
""Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers are generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence,"" the group said.
Wang's family have found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader after being given just one day in which to do so.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
He had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has in recent months cracked down on its tiny band of remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been imprisoned.

29,"China said on Sunday it will tighten inspections of imported animals and plants next year for possible diseases after Chinese quarantine officials banned poultry imports from several U.S. states and a part of Britain.
""The country's animal and quarantine authorities will carry out stricter inspection on a wide range of goods,"" the China Daily Business Weekly newspaper said.
Inspections would cover imports and exports of plants, animals, fruit and agricultural goods, as well as containers, packages and other materials used to transport them, according to new regulations approved this month by the State Council, or cabinet.
Quarantine and customs officials would inspect both hand-carried items as well as goods imported or exported by traders, the newspaper said.
Pets and plants of diplomats who have diplomatic immunity would also have to be inspected, it said.
The authorities could slap fines of up to 50,000 yuan ($6,000) on violators, the newspaper said.
Agricultural officials would be on the lookout for animal and plant diseases at home and abroad, it said.
Last week, China announced a ban on poultry imports from Missouri and Oklahoma, alleging that five cases of Newcastle disease were discovered in the two U.S. states between July and September.
The United States denied the accusation and said it sought talks with China to lift the ban.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the disease broke out in pet birds only, and that all the pet birds infected with the disease were destroyed.
The spokeswoman said she had no information on which U.S. states found pet birds with Newcastle disease or when the problems were discovered.
The newspaper said China banned in July poultry imports from an unidentified area of Britain it believed was affected by Newcastle disease.
In October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza. But the ban did not go into effect after China and the United States held talks on the issue.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products.
Some 330,000 tonnes of U.S. poultry products -- worth $445 million -- were exported to China through Hong Kong last year, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Every day, 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China, the council said.
Beijing and Washington are also at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector.
China had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.
Beijing said it was delaying by one month the implementation of those curbs, which had been scheduled to take effect December 10, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.

29,"The father of Chinese dissident Wang Dan protested his son's innocence on Wednesday, just hours before the start of the former student leader's trial, and said the family would not give in to the authorities.
""He is definitely innocent,"" Wang Xianzeng told reporters as he left his home to go to the court.
The trial of Wang Dan, 27, on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government was due to begin on Wednesday morning at the Beijing People's Intermediate Court.
The public was effectively barred from the court, which was surrounded by police who had set up roadblocks across all major roads leading to the building.
""It just depends on whether the government wants to convict him or not,"" Wang Xianzeng told reporters.
""I'm not optimistic about the results... We will definitely appeal... We will not give in,"" he said.
""Speech can't overthrow the government,"" he said.
The court charges against Wang say that his writings in foreign publications are part of evidence to back up the charge that he had tried to overthrow the government.
His mother, Wang Lingyun, said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty to the capital charge.
She said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days. Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.
The former student leader, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.
His family found a lawyer willing to defend the dissident after being given just one day in which to do so.
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.
The mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he was detained in May 1995.
Human Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.
""The fact is that China's urban dissident movement...has in effect been comprehensively smashed,"" it said in a statement.
""At least where political dissidents are concerned, all the judicial signs thus far point...to intensified repression by the country's state security forces,"" it said, calling for a freeze on trade missions from the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.
Wang's court appearance was expected to resemble the in-camera proceedings last December against Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
He was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.

29,"China's Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin appears to be making all the right moves to shore up his position to retain power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, diplomats and analysts said on Friday.
Jiang has declared war on corruption, crime and poverty -- scourges that have plagued China for centuries and led to the downfall of many a dynasty.
In his latest move, he used the party's four-day, annual closed-door plenum that ended in Beijing on Thursday to resurrect ideological puritanism -- spiritual civilisation -- which has been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms.
Whether Jiang would be able to stave off challenges from rivals in the party and cling to power in the post-Deng era hinged in part on the crucial 15th party congress to be held in late 1997, diplomats and analysts said.
The party's political heavyweights will be jockeying for position in the run-up to next year's congress, a five-yearly opportunity for reshuffles in the party's powerful Politburo and its yet more influential standing committee.
Chinese sources say the Communist Party is debating a plan to revive the post of chairman and to create one or two vice chairman positions -- one of which could be given to Premier Li Peng, a loose ally of Jiang whose term ends in 1998.
Li is required by the constitution to step down as premier in 1998 after serving two six-year terms and is keen to find another job to remain in the top echelons of power.
Armed with the weapon of spiritual civilisation -- communist jargon for toeing the party line -- Jiang is battling to avoid the fate of his two predecessors, analysts said.
Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang were sacked from the party's general secretary post in 1987 and 1989 respectively because their ""grip on material civilisation was tight but their grip on spiritual civilisation was loose"", one Chinese analyst said.
""They did not pay enough attention to ensuring that the party's position could not be challenged...that was what brought them down,"" an Asian diplomat said of Hu and Zhao.
A plenum communique attested to Jiang's worries. ""From the start to the end, we should be resolute on tightening the grip on both,"" the plenum communique said.
""At no time can we sacrifice spiritual values in the name of momentary economic development,"" the communique said.
The spiritual civilisation campaign aims to create a communist utopia -- stamp out superstition, tighten the party's grip on media, instil politically correct values and create heroes and model workers whose orthodox Marxist behaviour the populace at large should strive to emulate.
It is hardly rousing stuff. But Jiang may be desperate.
Analysts said Jiang remained overshadowed by Deng, architect of the market-oriented economic reforms and still influential even without an official post and despite increasingly fragile health.
""In the midst of his great triumph, Jiang Zemin if he is all that powerful...there is no need for him to go out of his way to mention Deng Xiaoping,"" a Western diplomat said referring to the communique that tips its hat to Deng.
""Jiang Zemin...is still in consolidation mode...in the process of selling himself,"" he said. ""The jury is still out.""
Jiang is eager to consolidate his power base even after amassing the three most important positions in China -- general secretary of the Communist Party, state president and chairman of party's powerful Central Military Commission.
Many diplomats see Jiang as a transitional figure after the death of Deng, which is widely expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.

29,"China has pledged to open its insurance, stock, retail, wholesale and banking sectors to foreign investment as part of a drive for long-delayed entry to the World Trade Organisation.
""From 1997-2000, China is expected to open its insurance and stock market wider to foreign investment,"" the China Daily said Sunday, quoting Ma Jixian, an official of the State Economic and Trade Commission under the cabinet.
The pledge was contained in a unilateral action plan submitted by China to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the Philippines last month, the newspaper said.
Before the end of the decade, foreign insurers would have access to markets outside Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Ma said without elaborating.
China's insurance market was once virtually monopolised by the state-owned People's Insurance Group but the sector has gradually opened up to domestic as well as foreign competition.
Only three foreign insurers are able to write insurance policies in China, including American International Assurance Co. Ltd, a part of the American International Group Inc.
The others are Japan's Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd and which has a life insurance joint venture with a domestic insurer.
Ma, one of China's representatives at the APEC summit, said foreign stock companies would be allowed to handle A shares, whose availability is still confined to native Chinese. He gave no further details.
Currently, foreign investors are restricted to buying B shares, while Chinese nationals can only buy A shares.
In its action plan, China also pledged to cut its average import tariffs to about 15 percent from the current 23 percent.
The tariffs would be reduced futher in subsequent years, Ma said without going into details.
""A majority of non-tariff measures will have been abolished by 2010 and all those incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules will have been erased by 2020,"" Ma said.
China has pushed to gain entry to the WTO on the favourable terms of a developing nation, but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy is too big for such preferential treatment.
According to the action plan, China would allow foreign banks to open more operational outfits in 24 Chinese cities and launch pilot bases where foreign banks can conduct yuan business, the newspaper said.
In the first decade of the next century, foreign banks would be allowed to expand their presence beyond the current 24 pilot cities and more pilot bases would be available for them to conduct yuan business, it said.
China would let overseas retailers establish more joint venture or cooperative retailing chains in areas beyond the 11 pilot cities currently allowed, the newspaper said.
The liberalisation would cover all provincial capitals and major economic cities by the year 2010, the newspaper said, adding that foreign retailers would be free to open outlets in China by 2020.
Foreign investors would be allowed larger stakes in China's power sector and have greater access to China's river, marine and road transportation if Beijing becomes a member of the WTO, it said.
China would further open its tourism sector, allowing joint venture travel agencies in five cities on an experimental basis over the next three years, the newspaper said.

21,"Weeping crowds mourning the death of Deng Xiaoping swamped the hamlet where China's political patriarch was born, prompting authorities to send armed police to keep order, officials said on Friday.
Thousands of mourners flocked to Paifang village in Guang'an county in the southwestern province of Sichuan, some falling to their knees and weeping, said an official at Deng's former residence, now a museum.
""There are a lot of people crying, some of them young, but most of them are older,"" the official said by telephone.
""Some old people have knelt on the ground and wept. Their faces were covered in tears,"" he said.
Deng, architect of market-oriented reforms that transformed China into a rising superpower, passed away on Wednesday night aged 92.
Officials at Deng's old courtyard abode, which normally saw some 100 visitors a day, were unable to handle the flood of people that broke over the hamlet after Deng's death was announced early on Thursday.
""About 3,000 people came here yesterday,"" the official said. ""Today there will be more.""
""It's extremely crowded in here,"" he said. ""Anywhere there is room to stand is crowded with people.""
Officials sent the paramilitary People's Armed Police to maintain order at the museum, which had been converted into a makeshift shrine to Deng, he said.
""Although there are a lot of people, everything is orderly,"" the official said, adding that no incidents had been reported.
A large photograph of Deng hung over the courtyard entrance, crowned by a black banner with white characters reading ""Mourn Deng Xiaoping With Sorrow"", he said.
""One young fellow cried and said 'Without Deng there would not be the happy life of today',"" the official said.
Mourners, many wearing black armbands and holding white, handmade paper flowers, filed past the photograph, bowing or kneeling in front of a table heaped with cypress branches symbolising uprightness and longevity.
Some of those paying their last respects to Deng had come from distant Guangzhou and Shenzhen in the southern province of Guangdong, a booming region that owed its prosperity to his ambitious capitalistic reforms, another museum official said.
""Taxis, shops, hotels...and those who have come to Guang'an for business or as tourists are displaying white flowers to show their grief over Deng Xiaoping,"" the China News Service said.
The outpouring of sadness and reflection in Paifang contrasted with the bustling streets of Beijing, where flags flying at half-mast on the second day of official mourning were the only sign of a break from routine.
The Supreme People's Court, China's top judicial body, ordered all courts to ensure strict law enforcement and to safeguard social stability, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Political transitions in communist China in the past have been fraught with difficulty and the deaths of some previous senior leaders have triggered mass protests.
"
21,"When China's Chairman Mao Zedong died the news paralysed the nation, but 20 years later the passing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is mere office chatter in a country radically changed by his policies.
Some Chinese responded on Thursday to Deng's death with sadness and others with cold indifference. There was no great outpouring of grief of the kind that accompanied Mao's death in September, 1976.
When Mao died at age 82, weeping crowds poured out of factories and offices.
""It was like a family had lost its mother or the sky had collapsed,"" said a woman who was at high school then.
""We cried like we lost our father and mother,"" said a driver parked near Deng's residence in central Beijing. ""Now everyone is indifferent.""
Beijing announced six days of mourning for Deng, whose death at 92 on Wednesday closed the book on almost two decades of rule that transformed China into a budding economic powerhouse.
But in streets and offices it was business as usual, with no outward displays of grief. Street markets bustled and factories of the new economic powerhouse that Deng created hummed with activity.
""I am a little sad over Deng, but not shocked. People knew early on that Deng's health was poor,"" said a clerk bustling off to work.
""Deng doesn't measure up to the likes of Mao,"" said a 62-year-old sunflower seed vendor. ""I don't care one bit about Deng's death.""
Residents and political analysts said the greater freedom created by Deng's reformist economic policies changed the way Chinese regarded their leaders.
""This indicates people's attitudes towards the death of leaders has matured -- their minds are free,"" said a Chinese analyst who declined to be identified.

21,"China's inefficient coal sector needs foreign funds and technology to modernise but must do more to create a better investment environment, industry officials and foreign businessmen said on Tuesday.
""There are opportunities for literally billions of dollars in coal investments here,"" said David Klingner, group executive of Australian mining group CRA Ltd.
Development of the sector's small and inefficient mines and antiquated power plants would be vital for China to meet ambitious production goals and sustain economic growth in the next century, Klingner told an energy conference in Beijing.
""The government is coming to realise that a way to ensure that the energy resources for future development are available is by getting foreign companies in with their expertise and capital capacity,"" Klingner said.
China relies on coal to meet about 75 percent of its energy needs and production accounted for about one-third of world output, Klingner said.
However, Beijing needed to create a sound investment environment to woo foreign cash and technology to the backward sector, said Rong Geng, director of the coal and oil department of China's State Development Bank.
""The coal industry... is characterised by long periods of construction, huge demands for funds, long repayment periods, low profits and certain risks,"" Rong said.
About 10 percent of funding for large and medium-scale coal projects came from overseas, Rong said, adding that his bank would try to raise more foreign capital for coal projects in China.
""We need to foster a sound investment environment for foreign investors so as to enhance their confidence,"" Rong told the conference.
Klingner said Beijing had made large strides in opening its doors to the once-sensitive power sector but foreign firms would require stronger legal guarantees before taking the plunge into the Chinese market.
""Foreign companies see the regulatory framework for mining investments, especially insofar as it relates to resources title, as critical to the success of any long-term commercial venture,"" he said.
Better risk assessment, long-term contracts and assurances of continued profits are also vital to entice foreign firms to China's coal sector, he said.
""The international financial community will want these issues settled prior to the funding of large-scale mining projects,"" he said.
China, with more than 80,000 small-scale mines, needed to form large-scale production to improve efficiency and cut down on waste and pollution, he said, adding that streamlining was now being balanced against the politically-charged concerns of mass unemployment.
Large-scale mining could also greatly reduce China's high rate of mining deaths and accidents, he said. About 10,000 workers are killed in China's mines every year.
China has said it would open at least 300 coal projects to foreign investors with priority to foreign investment in pit-head power plants, coal transport facilities and coal-bed methane. It has not said whether investors would be allowed to export output.
"
21,"China posted a trade surplus of $12.24 billion in 1996 on Friday, lower than recent official projections but an about-face from predictions early in the year of a trade deficit.
Exports were spurred by the government's faster payment of export tax rebates and an expansion of credit to exporters as well as by soaring trade by foreign-invested enterprises.
Exports for the year totalled $151.07 billion, up by 1.5 percent compared with 1995, the official Xinhua news agency quoted customs figures as showing.
Imports were $138.83 billion, climbing by 5.1 percent, the customs figures showed.
The customs figures did not specify trade in December alone, but the surplus for the whole year of $12.24 billion indicated that exports slid in the last month of the year to give an estimated deficit for that month of $1.74 billion.
The surplus for the year fell short of the State Statistical Bureau's provisional estimate last month of a $16 billion surplus. It was down from the $16.7 billion surplus in 1995.
Many economists had forecast China would post a trade deficit for 1996, or at best achieve balanced trade, after it registered a deficit of $1.15 billion in the first quarter of the year.
The slow pace of government payment of export tax rebates to exporters in the first half of 1996 coupled with the relative strength of the yuan currency had been expected to sharply cut exports.
Imports had been forecast to soar after Beijing slashed import tariffs on more than 4,000 items to an average 23 percent last April.
However, imports grew more slowly than expected due to the elimination of many tariff exemptions in imports of capital goods for foreign-funded firms.
A government move to revive trade by sharply accelerating payments of export tax rebates in the second half of the year along with a strong export performance by foreign-funded firms fuelled the surplus.
The trade volume of overseas-funded businesses increased by 25 percent in 1996, to $137.1 billion, the customs figures showed. They gave no breakdown for exports. Economists have said most export gains were made by foreign-invested companies while China's state-run firms showed disappointing export records.
Foreign trade of state-owned businesses fell by 11 percent, to total $145.2 billion, the latest figures showed.
Japan was China's largest trading partner last year, with total trade hitting $60.1 billion. China exported $30.9 billion of goods to Japan, up slightly from $29.2 billion in 1995.
Trade with the United States rose 4.9 percent to nearly $43 billion, customs said, but gave no details of the imbalance.
U.S. figures show a ballooning surplus in favour of China, and this has become a thorn in Beijing's ties with Washington. Beijing has said it has a trade deficit with the United States.
Trade with the European Union edged up 1.6 percent to $39.7 billion.
China imported 22.62 million tonnes of crude oil, a rise of 32 percent from 1995 and steel imports rose 14 percent to 15.99 million tonnes, the figures showed. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)

21,"China has sentenced two veteran democracy activists to hard labour for up to three years, a fellow dissident said on Saturday.
Authorities in Taiyuan in central China's Shanxi province sentenced Fu Guoyong to three years of re-education through labour, the dissident told Reuters by telephone.
Fellow activist Chen Ping, who had worked with Fu on pro-democracy tracts, had been sentenced to one year of labour reform, said the dissident who asked not to be identified.
""The reason was because they published articles abroad about democracy,"" said the dissident. ""They just wrote some articles. There really was no reason for this.""
Authorities had branded the essays counter-revolutionary, said a statement by the Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
Taiyuan police detained Fu, 29, in late July for what they said were illegal political activities.
Chen, 45, had been arrested in Taiyuan in August and was sentenced together with Fu, the source said, adding he did not know when the sentences had been passed.
Police in Taiyuan contacted by telephone declined to comment on the cases. Family members were not available.
Fu moved to Taiyuan in late June, complaining of repeated harassment by police in Hangzhou city in the eastern province of Zhejiang, where he had been living with his wife.
Fu previously served two years in a labour camp for his role in the student-led demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life on June 4, 1989.
Police detained Fu for more than a month in December 1995 after he, along with dissidents Wang Donghai and Chen Longde, wrote a letter calling for the release of Wei Jingsheng, widely regarded as the father of China's modern democracy movement.
Fu also joined in an appeal with Wang and Chen Longde to China's parliament before the 1996 anniversary of the bloody June 4 crackdown, demanding the release of those jailed for their involvement in the movement.
Fu and Chen Ping's sentences come amid a widening crackdown on dissent by Beijing. Most dissidents are already serving lengthy sentences in prisons or labour camps or have been forced into exile.
China drew international condemnation when a Beijing court sentenced former student leader Wang Dan to 11 years in prison in October for conspiring to subvert the government.
Beijing dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.
A Chinese court last week sentenced dissident Zhang Zong'ai to five years in prison for counter-revolutionary incitement.
Three pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei, capital of the central province of Anhui.

21,"China's top graft-buster on Monday lauded the country's success in battling corruption in 1996 but urged greater efforts this year to fight abuses of power by government officials.
Vigilant residents and rules requiring officials to report their incomes had helped uncover hundreds of thousands of graft cases in 1996, Xinhua news agency quoted Wei Jianxing, chairman of the Communist Party's Central Disciplinary Inspection Committee, as saying.
Authorities had also cracked several cases involving major officials such as Tie Ying, a member of the standing committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Wei told a meeting of the committee in Beijing that opened on Monday.
Several officials were dismissed during the investigation of those cases, Wei said but gave no further details.
More work was needed to fight corruption in 1997, Wei said.
""While affirming the achievements of 1996 we must address the serious situation and problems facing the anti-corruption drive,"" Wei said.
President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin launched a crackdown on corruption in 1995, saying that graft was a virus that threatened to topple the party.
Wei said China should place priority on fighting random and illegal fees on public roads, students in primary and middle schools and on farmers.
""The leaders and cadres of some localities and departments still do not have sufficient understanding of the seriousness and importance of the anti-corruption struggle,"" he said.
The party should step up internal scrutiny and encourage supervision of officials by the public, he said.
Residents made more than 1.45 million telephone calls to anti-graft hotlines in January-November last year, 16.8 percent more than the same period in 1995, he said.
The calls had resulted in more than 135,000 cases, including 5,643 involving officials at the county level or above, he said. The total number of cases in the period had risen 10.9 percent from the same time in 1995.
Disciplinary authorities had punished more than 116,000 people, up 14.3 percent from the year before. Of those, 3,695 were from the county level or above while 321 were provincial level officials, he said.
Investigators had found more than 21,000 cars used by party or government officials that exceeded standards set for officials, he said.
More than 72,000 officials had admitted using their positions to obtain better housing, with 74 percent handing over a total of 94 million yuan ($11.3 million) to pay for the housing, he said.
Some 85,000 officials, 95 percent of whom ranked above the county level, had handed over cash and gifts worth more than 51 million yuan ($6.1 million), he said.
Government agencies and state-owned enterprises had reduced entertainment expenses by 1.6 billion yuan ($193 million) after being forced to make full accountings of such items, he said.
""The use of public funds to engage in the unhealthy trend of 'eat, drink and be merry' has been contained somewhat,"" he said.

21,"U.S. Vice-President Al Gore could visit China in early 1997 if he was re-elected next month, a senior U.S. official said in Beijing on Saturday.
""We have sent a proposal here and it's been reviewed and I don't think there's any real disagreement,"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Eileen Claussen said when asked if Gore had any plans to visit China.
""The vice-president is very interested in trying to establish...a sustainable development forum here between (Chinese Premier) Li Peng and the vice-president,"" she told a news conference.
No specific date has been set for Gore's visit.
""We are now discussing terms of reference for that and there's every expectation that if those terms of reference are worked out, the vice-president will make a visit in the spring,"" she said.
Asked to elaborate on the terms of reference, Claussen said: ""We just have to have sort of a set of operating rules and subjects we're going to talk about.""
A visit by Gore could improve often stormy Sino-U.S. ties, which plunged to their lowest ebb in more than two decades after Washington enraged Beijing by allowing Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to make a landmark, private visit in June 1995.
Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since Mao Zedong's Red Army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is due to visit Beijing in November and Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian plans to make a long-delayed trip to Washington before the end of the year.
China postponed Chi's visit to Washington in March, infuriated by a U.S. decision to order two aircraft carriers into seas near Taiwan as the island inched towards democracy -- holding its first direct presidential elections -- in the face of missile tests and live-fire war games.
Beijing and Washington have also wrangled over alleged sales of nuclear technology by China, human rights abuses in China and trade issues.
China has bitterly accused the United States of blocking its bid to gain admission to the World Trade Organisation.
Beijing and Washington narrowly avoided a trade war in June and February 1995 over widespread copyright piracy.

21,"China on Tuesday played down fears over the health of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping that were fuelled after Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin cut short an out-of-town trip to visit the ailing patriarch.
""There has been no big change in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang told a news briefing, but he gave no details of what would constitute a major change in the health of the fragile 92-year-old patriarch.
Tang declined to say if there had been a small change.
Officials of the State Council, or cabinet, who usually answer queries about Deng's health with the official line that he is as well as can be expected for a man of his age, could say only they were investigating the situation. Chinese sources said on Monday that Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng both cut short provincial trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit Deng.
Officials declined to comment directly on a tide of rumours washing around the Chinese capital concerning Deng's condition but diplomats said his health had likely deteriorated recently.
""It's been clear for a while that things have been...going downhill,"" said one Western diplomat.
One indication of Deng's worsening state was that officials and family members had backed off from forecasts that Deng would travel to Hong Kong to witness Beijing's resumption of rule over the British colony at midnight on June 30, the diplomat said.
""Clearly things are a bit on shaky ground,"" the diplomat said.
Taiwan's United Daily News quoted the island's top official on mainland affairs, Chang King-yuh, as saying Deng's condition was serious. Officials said they were closely monitoring his health.
Diplomats have said one barometer of Deng's health in China's highly-secretive political system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few considered willing to be caught out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death.
Chinese officials in the Philippines said visiting Defence Minister Chi Haotian would not change his travel plans there and Beijing's mission in Israel said Vice-Premier Li Lanqing would not interrupt his current trip to Israel and Iran.
Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded central Beijing compound close to the Forbidden City, home for centuries to China's emperors.
A Hong Kong newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of China's sweeping economic reforms was rushed to hospital last Thursday after a massive stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke.
Doctors said that if Deng's stroke had been a haemorrhage he could have died within hours. If it was the formation of a blood clot, he could last days or weeks, they said.
Rumours about Deng's health surface periodically and often have a direct impact on China-related bourses, where Deng's demise is seen by some as a potentially destabilising factor.
Worries over Deng's health helped to push shares on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges sharply lower by their close on Tuesday and also rocked share prices in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he appeared frail and faltering. He is thought to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity.

21,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin, seeking to ensure his grip on power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, called on the army on Tuesday to obey only the ruling Communist Party.
The People's Liberation Army, whose backing Jiang needs to ensure political control, should toe the party line, Jiang told a meeting of army delegates to the National People's Congress, or parliament.
""On this vital political issue that concerns the future and destiny of the party, the state and the nation, there must not be the slightest ambiguity or vacillation,"" the official Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as saying.
Jiang, who also holds the posts of Communist Party chief and chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, never served in the armed forces and has tried hard to win army support to bolster his position as Deng's political heir.
Deng died on February 19 aged 92.
Jiang has since moved to cement his position as China's supreme ruler, urging the nation to rally around the party with him at its core.
On Tuesday, Jiang called on army members of parliament to ""seek no fame, status and promotion (and) give priority to the party"", Xinhua said.
""Our army has always followed what the party says,"" he told the meeting, which was attended by generals Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Wan'nian and Chi Haotian. All of them are vice-chairmen of the military commission while Chi also serves as defence minister.
Jiang told his audience that the party's leadership had enabled military victories of the past and made the armed forces stronger.
But he said the drive to modernise the three million strong army had created a range of problems and warned officers not to step outside the law while performing their duties.
""Cadres at various levels must run the army with strict discipline and according to law and do their routine ideological and managerial work in a meticulous way,"" he said.
The army that ushered in nearly five decades of communist rule has benefited immensely from capitalist-style reforms launched by Deng in the late 1970s, running luxury hotels, factories and dealing in real estate.
Told by Beijing to make money for itself to supplement its budget, the army has also been widely accused of smuggling and other official abuses of power in its drive to do so.
China has set a defence budget of 80.6 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) this year, a rise of 12.7 percent over actual spending for 1996.
Western military analysts say total defence spending is considerably higher than the published figures.
Beijing defends its hefty increases in military spending by saying the base figure is still low and inflation has cut buying power.

21,"Chinese police cordoned off a South Korean embassy compound and North Korean diplomats waited outside as a senior Seoul official was due for talks with Beijing on the apparent defection of a top Pyongyang official.
Dozens of Chinese police blocked streets to South Korea's consular section in the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, and embassy officials said Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to the North's leader Kim Jong-il, was holed up inside.
China remained silent as it found itself at the centre of a diplomatic crisis involving its old communist comrade, Pyongyang, and new commercial ally, Seoul.
South Korea sent Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha, to Beijing on Thursday morning for talks with Chinese officials on the fate of Hwang who it said had sought asylum along with his assistant Kim Dok-hong.
In a sign of the suspicion that underscores dealings between North and South, South Korean embassy officials accused North Koreans of trying to force their way into the consular office.
Diplomats from Pyongyang sat in parked cars outside the consular compound and waited outside the embassy, watching from behind the police cordons.
""Last night, North Korean people who we believe were from the embassy tried to enter our consular section,"" embassy spokesman Chang Moon-Ik told reporters.
Chinese police on guard around the compound had prevented the North Koreans from entering, he said.
He dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, Jong-il, had been kidnapped by the South, saying Hwang had voluntarily sought asylum.
""He came by taxi without any notice,"" the spokesman said.
North Korean diplomats stood by the kidnapping charge.
""I think South Korea has kidnapped these two officials,"" said one of several North Korean officials waiting in the office tower housing Seoul's embassy. ""The impossible has happened.""
An official at the North Korean embassy repeated a Pyongyang Foreign Ministry statement that accused Seoul of kidnapping Hwang and urged Beijing to sort out the mess.
""If it is brought to light that the South Korean authorities kidnapped him and describe him as seeking 'asylum', we will regard it as a serious incident without precedent and take due countermeasures,"" the Korean Central News Agency quoted a Pyongyang Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.
""We expect that the Chinese side will take appropriate measures in this regard,"" the spokesman added.
Beijing is caught in the wrangle between North Korea, one of its last remaining socialist allies, and the capitalist South, which has become an important trading partner and source of investment.
Hwang, 73, is one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, and would be the highest ranking Pyongyang official ever to seek asylum in the South.
He is credited with playing a leading role in shaping the policy of Juche, a brand of fanatic self-reliance providing the ideological underpinning for the world's last Stalinist state.
South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.

Figures compiled by Boeing show the Seattle-based aerospace giant had net orders for 559 airplanes with a ""catalog"" value of $42.8 billion after excluding cancellations and conversion.
That compared with 301 jets worth $21.6 billion for Boeing's European rival Airbus Industrie, which took a 32 percent share of the market.
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Boeing has agreed to acquire, took net orders for 38 jets valued at $2.2 billion for a 3 percent share of the market for airplanes with 100 seats or more.
""Our customers put us on top again in 1996 because of the superior value of our complete family of airplanes,"" Boeing commercial airplane group President Ron Woodard said. ""Our goal is to remain No. 1.""
Woodard told reporters he expected 1997 to be as strong or stronger and said 1998 could see orders continue to roll in at a strong level as the international airline industry expands after the long downturn of the early 1990s.
""Airplanes are flying extremely full right now,"" Woodard said. ""The orders we've seen to date are still catching up with what is a reasonable level given the demand.... It looks to us to be a pretty sustained, healthy cycle.""
Boeing's order book went far beyond analyst expectations or the previous peak years of the late 1980s.
""It's an unbelievable year,"" said Paul Nisbet, analyst at JSA Research. ""Nobody expected that at the beginning of the year.
Boeing's previous best year for total orders was 1990, the year the 777 was launched, when it took orders for 483 jets valued at $41.4 billion.
Calculating the order book each year is something of a public-relations exercise as airplane orders are frequently revised, canceled or converted.
For example, Boeing's total is comprised mainly of firm orders, but the manufacturer also included its massive $6.5 billion order from AMR Corp.'s American Airlines which was announced but not signed.
An Airbus spokesman said the European consortium did not include such ""commitments"" for an additional 172 airplanes received last year such as USAir Inc.'s stated intention to buy 120 jets worth at least $5 billion.
Nisbet said despite the gamesmanship, it seemed clear Boeing is on the way to its goal of a two-thirds share of the market, up from its historical 60 percent level.
Airbus will have about one-third of the market as virtually the only other player, assuming Boeing wins federal approval for its plan to absorb McDonnell Douglas, including its commercial jet operations.
The Airbus spokesman, David Venz, said the four-nation consortium still hoped to achieve its stated goal of a 50 percent market share around the turn of the century.
Airbus officials confirmed Tuesday they were negotiating with South Korean firms to help finance its planned A3XX jumbo jet, which would break the stranglehold on the lucrative top end of the market now held by Boeing's 747 jumbo jet.
Woodard said the business case for a new large jet was very difficult to make because of predictions the trans-Pacific market will ""fragment"" into less heavily traveled point-to-point routes rather than routes between the largest markets.
He noted that Boeing has not yet been able to drum up sufficient customer interest even to launch a stretch version of its 747, which would presumably be less expensive to develop than an all-new airplane.
Boeing delivered 218 airplanes last year, only slightly higher than the 206 delivered in 1995, when production was hampered by a 10-week strike.
Analyst Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities said he expected Boeing to deliver some 360 jets this year and 430 in 1998, based on announced increased in the company's production rates.

14,"Boeing Co defense and space group President Gerald King said the company's planned acquisition of Rockwell International Corp's defense and space business was on track to close in early December.
In an interview, King also said he expected the defense and space group to remain ""a significant part of the Boeing Co"" with 30 to 40 percent of the company's total revenues ""over time.""  
King said he expected federal regulators to complete an antitrust review of the planned Rockwell deal early next month. The proposal also needs to be approved by Rockwell shareholders at a meeting set for Dec. 4 and should close within a few days after that, he said.
""Something could always happen to the merger to keep it from going through, I suppose, even though it looks like a slam dunk in comparison with some of the other things that have been done in this industry,"" King said.  
Last year defense and space revenues of $5.58 billion were 29 percent of the company's $19.52 billion in revenues, with commercial aircraft sales accounting for the rest.
This year defense and space revenues are expected to be nearly flat, while overall company revenues rise to about $22.6 billion, reflecting growth in commercial jet deliveries, said analyst Peter Jacobs of Ragen MacKenzie.
The Rockwell acquisition will add about $2.6 billion in revenue to the defense and space group next year, and King said the company has no immediate plans for further acquisitions.
""We're looking only to make this one work first,"" he said. ""If there's a next step, we'll think about that later.""
King said the defense and space group continues to pursue commercial opportunities, including the Sea Launch program, which he said was on track for initial satellite launch in mid-1998.
King also said the company and its partner, Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter division, are offering a nine-passenger civilian version of their V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft that will be available in 2001.

14,"Upscale apparel retailer Nordstrom Inc. Monday posted a 16 percent increase in earnings for its third quarter as it boosted sales and reduced markdowns.
For the fiscal third quarter ending Oct. 31, Nordstrom posted sales of $984 million, up 9 percent over last year's $907 million. Net income rose to $34 million, or 42 cents a share, from $29 million, or 36 cents a share, last year.
When certain one-time gains and costs were excluded, the company earned about 38 cents a share, compared with a Wall Street consensus forecast of 36 cents, said Piper Jaffray analyst Saul Yaari.
He and other analysts said they expected to raise their estimates.
""It was a great quarter,"" said Jennifer Black Groves of Black &amp; Co. in Portland, Ore.
She noted the company had a difficult summer because of an over-reliance on unpopular body-hugging fashions and a merchandise reconfiguration that confused customers and sales executives.
The result was heavy markdowns in July and August that ate into earnings, but company executives said the deepest of the markdowns appear to be behind them.
""They sacrificed the short term for what will be very beenficial for them in the long term,"" Groves said.
She said the merchandise reconfiguration, aimed at bringing the company's clothing selections more into line with its customer base, has ""rejuvenated the company.""
""I think you're going to see some great numbers in the year ahead,"" she said.
Nordstrom said comparable-store sales, a closely watched measure of industry performance, fell 0.3 percent in the latest quarter but were up 1.5 percent for the year to date.
And executives told analysts in a conference call that their plans called for comparable-store sales to rise at least 2 percent in the critical holiday quarter compared with a relatively weak 1995 period.
""We have plenty of ability to respond to sales above that,"" Nordstrom co-Chairman John Whitacre said in the conference call.
Comparable-store sales are adjusted to represent only that retail space that has been open at least a year.
Nordstrom has opened several new stores this year and plans to open three new department stores and several smaller stores next year, adding about 719,000 square feet of store space to its current total of 11.74 million, executives said.

14,"An outbreak of bacterial food poisoning that sickened at least 13 children and young adults in the Seattle area has been traced to one company's tainted apple juice, health officials said on Wednesday.
Odwalla Inc, a rapidly growing fresh juice and beverage company based in Half Moon Bay, California, issued a nationwide recall of products containing fresh apple juice, and many retailers pulled all Odwalla beverages from their shelves.
State and county health officials said 10 of the 13 confirmed cases of E. coli food poisoning had been conclusively traced to the unpasteurized Odwalla juice and the remaining three were under investigation.
At least eight more suspected cases have been reported, Dr. Mimi Fields, the state's deputy health secretary, said.
""It's difficult to know where we are on the epidenmic curve, although I don't think we are going to see a large influx of masses of new cases,"" Fields told Reuters.
The outbreak was the state's worst since some 500 people became ill in the Seattle area and three children died in 1993 after eating undercooked hamburgers.
While adults may suffer diarrhea, stomach cramps or more mild, flulike symptoms after eating food tainted by the bacterium, young children are more susceptible to the disease and may suffer sudden kidney failure that can lead to permanent brain damage or death.
In the current outbreak, six children have been hospitalized, including two who required dialysis. Officials said all the children had been released except for one 2-year-old boy, who was in satisfactory condition.
The strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak normally lives in the digestion system of cattle and can spread into the food chain through slaughterhouse contamination or fertilizer that includes steer manure.
Health officials said juice can be tainted when fruit falls onto fertilized ground and is not washed properly.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has launched an investigation and will be inspecting Odwalla's plant in Dinuba, California, health officials said.
""Our first concern is for the health and safety of those affected,"" Odwalla chief executive officer Stephen Williamson said in a statement. He said the company was cooperating fully with health authorities.
Although so far all the cases have been traced to Odwalla juice, authorities recommended that consumers in the Seattle area boil unpasteurized apple juice or cider for 10 seconds before drinking it until the investigation was complete.
Odwalla, which bills itself as the ""leading branded fresh juice and beverage company,"" distributes its beverages in pint plastic bottles to supermarkets and retail outlets in Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and British Columbia.
In the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, the company reported its sales rose 65 percent to $59.2 million from $35.9 million. But net income fell to $633,000, or 12 cents a share, from $997,000, or 22 cents a share.
"
14,"Microsoft Corp. reported better-than-expected profits for the latest quarter Monday as strong demand for its Windows operating systems and applications helped fuel record sales.
The computer software giant said earnings rose 23 percent to a record $614 million, or 95 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, from $499 million, or 78 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues jumped 14 percent to $2.30 billion from $2.02 billion.
The profits, announced after the market closed, exceeded the Wall Street consensus expectation of 90 cents a share, and Microsoft shares rose to $136.375 in after-hours trading from the earlier close of $134 on Nasdaq.
Treasurer Greg Maffei said the 14 percent revenue increase was the smallest ever posted in the company's 21-year history, reflecting a surge in sales last year when Microsoft launched its Windows 95 operating system.
But with the high sales, marketing and manufacturing costs of Windows 95 also behind it, the company's operating profit margin surged to a record 39.3 percent of revenues, compared with about 35.1 percent a year earlier, said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.
""It looks like it was just a great quarter, and there's more to come,"" he said.
Microsoft executives said in a conference call with analysts that business would continue to be boosted by an expected holiday surge in sales of personal computers and the December release of Office 97, an update to the company's business applications product.
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said he expected revenues to rise sequentially over the next two quarters and indicated revenue for the current quarter could be in the range of $2.4 billion, about 12 percent over last year's levels.
But he said the company's cost of goods sold should remain at about 11 percent of sales, compared with 15 percent in last year's second quarter.
""I'm very happy with the general revenue trend, and I was very pleased with the pattern of costs in the quarter,"" Brown said in an interview.
Microsoft also cited strong acceptance of the company's high end Windows NT operating system.
Maffei said sales of the NT workstation were up 400 percent over year-ago levels, while revenues from the BackOffice suite of server products doubled. Officials declined to give figures, but the BackOffice line currently generates about $1 billion in annual revenue.
Microsoft's overall revenues are about evenly divided between operating systems -- most of which are shipped loaded on new computers -- and applications.
Excluding sales directly to manufacturers, European revenues were flat in the quarter compared with the year-earlier period, and revenues in the United States and Europe rose 9 percent, reflecting the tough comparison.
But revenues from other markets such as Japan, where Windows 95 was not released until later, were up 32 percent, Microsoft said.
Overall last year Microsoft revenues and profits grew 46 percent, driven largely by the Windows 95 launch.
Brown also said the company was on track to spend $2.1 billion on research and development in the current fiscal year, including such ventures as its MSNBC cable and Internet news venture with NBC.
And the ""unearned revenue"" in the company's balance sheet from cyclical products such as Windows grew to $651 million as of Sept. 30 from $560 million three months earlier.
The company's cash hoard grew slightly to $7.1 billion from $6.94 billion.
"
14,"Microsoft Corp. Friday reported better-than-expected second-quarter profits on broad strength in sales of its personal computer software but warned of slower earnings growth next year.
The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant posted earnings of $741 million or 57 cents a share in the second quarter of fiscal 1997, a 29 percent increase over the $575 million, or 45 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 22 percent to $2.68 billion from $2.2 billion a year earlier.
The results, issued after the market had closed, beat analysts' highest forecasts, sending shares of Microsoft as high as $89 in after-hours trading, but the stock later fell to $85.50 due to the warning about slower earnings growth. In regular Nasdaq trading, Microsoft had gained $1.125 to $87.125.
""It was a terrific quarter,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund. ""Compared with expectations, revenue was quite a bit stronger than expected, as was the earnings number.""
Wall Street analysts on average had expected Microsoft to report earnings of 51 cents a share, with estimates ranging from 47 to 55 cents, according to First Call.
Microsoft's earnings in the quarter were driven by strong sales in virtually all areas, including its Windows computer operating systems, BackOffice server software and desktop applications such as Office, executives said.
Revenues from ""OEM"" sales through computer manufacturers rose 29 percent to $866 million, while revenues from countries outside the United States, Canada and Europe rose 32 percent to $424 million, with Japan a particularly strong performer.
But in the earnings statement and in a conference call later with reporters and analysts, Microsoft chief financial officer Mike Brown warned that the company's growth is likely to slow in fiscal 1998, which begins July 1.
""We are pleased with the current financial results and growth prospects for the next two quarters, particularly with the outlook for sales of Office 97,"" Brown said in the statement.
""However I do anticipate slower earnings growth in fiscal 1998 (beginning July 1997) due to lower revenue increases in our maturing businesses and margin pressure from continuing aggressive spending on research and development and new business ventures,"" Brown said.
In the conference call he went so far as to wonder aloud about Microsoft's high stock price compared with its anticipated earnings growth.
""It's not my purpose to second-guess the market,"" he said. ""However I will say that our current EPS (earnings per share) multiple is cause for curiosty at least to me.""
Sherlund said such cautionary comments were typical of the company's financially conservative nature.
""Directionally those comments were quite consistent with what we've heard before,"" Sherlund said.
Scott McAdams, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie, said that while Microsoft's price-earnings multiple is higher than would be expected given its slowing growth, investors pay a premium for its ability to consistently beat earnings estimates.
In a sign of Microsoft's financial strength, the software giant said it ended the quarter with $9.16 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $7.1 billion just three months earlier.
And the company's ""unearned revenues,"" representing sales deferred to reflect costs incurred over the life of cyclical products such as Windows 95 and Office, rose to $1.013 billion from $651 million at the end of the previous quarter.

14,"Microsoft Corp is expected to report modest earnings growth for the latest quarter on Friday despite tough comparisons with the year-earlier period and a sales slowdown ahead of an upgrade of a popular software package.
Industry analysts surveyed by First Call on average expect Microsoft to report earnings of 51 cents a share for its second quarter ended December 31, up about 16 percent from the 44 cents a share reported a year earlier. Sales are expected to rise about 14 percent to more than $2.5 billion.
Analysts consider that a strong performance against tough comparisons with the year-earlier period, the first full quarter of availability for the Windows 95 operating system.
In the 1995 second quarter sales soared 54 percent and net income jumped 48 percent.
""These guys are just incredibly strong now,"" said Rob Owens of Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore. ""They'll probably meet or beat (Wall) Street's estimate again.""
Investors will have all weekend to analyse the results, which are due to be released after the close of trading on Friday.
Microsoft executives originally had scheduled the release for Thursday but decided to delay the report until a day after an event publicising the launch of Office 97, its best-selling package of business software.
Analysts estimated that revenues of Office and its component applications account for up to 30 percent of Microsoft's total, but the figure will be lower for the quarter just ended because of the impending upgrade.
For much of the quarter Microsoft offered Office 95 buyers coupons good for a free upgrade, which will result in some revenues being deferred into future reporting periods.
But strong growth in personal computer sales and in acceptance of Microsoft's high-end Windows NT operating system continue to buoy the company's profits.
""The ongoing strength of the NT cycle is what's carrying the day,"" said Chris Galvin of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. ""Countervailing that is the tough comparison last year with the Windows 95 release, so it's a mixed scenario.""
Owen said that while sales of PCs to consumers were sluggish in the latest quarter, declining prices and increased processing power had sparked a new wave of corporate buying.
He said 30 percent or fewer of corporate desktops have made the transition to the Windows 95 or Windows NT systems.
""That's a tremendous opportunity for Microsoft,"" he said.  
The Malaysian Prime Minister said participants had raised concerns about shortages of skilled knowledge workers, and about how to market products in neighbouring countries.
Malaysia's newly formed Multimedia Development Corp is preparing to take formal applications beginning in March from ""world-class companies"" wanting to set up operations in the Multimedia Super Corridor.
McNealy said Sun Microsystems was already planning to put a Java Software Development Competency Center in the new high tech zone, and a senior executive of NTT Corp said the Japanese telecommunications giant was also planning to locate a research and development centre in the multimedia corridor.
NTT also wants to join other participants in forming a Multimedia University which Malaysia envisions for the area.
Some of the executives said the project was ambitious, and would likely face many pressures for the plan to change as it progressed, despite its success in attracting initial support.
""You cannot command creation,"" said Bishop. ""We have an impeccable plan, but execution still has to happen. We know enough in this new digital world that there are a lot of unpredictable discontinuities that occur. No country has a monopoly on these things.""

14,"Boeing Co.'s stunning agreement to acquire longtime rival McDonnell Douglas Corp. won a ringing endorsement from Wall Street and sent shock waves through the aerospace industry Monday.
Stock in both companies soared on expectations the deal would boost Boeing's operating profits immediately after its completion, targeted for mid-1997.
Boeing rose $4.375 to $101.125 and McDonnell Douglas jumped $10.375 to $62.375, down from earlier highs on the New York Stock Exchange but good enough to give the all-stock transaction an indicated value of nearly $14 billion.
Industry analysts saw few obstacles to the deal, which marks a startling transformation for a company that just a year ago was completing a final round of cutbacks that had slashed its work force by 30 percent in five years.
Since then Boeing has completed the $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp.'s defense and space business, won the right to compete for the richest military contract in Pentagon history and announced orders for a record $45.6 billion in new commercial jets.
""It's an incredible turnaround story,"" said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, which specializes in aerospace. ""These are very bold, dramatic, uncharacteristic moves for Boeing and I applaud them for it.""
While Boeing had been moving to cut costs and transform its management style under outgoing Chairman Frank Shrontz, the pace has accelerated at the once-sluggish company since Phil Condit was named chief executive officer in April.
Condit began the final round of merger negotiations with McDonnell Douglas last Tuesday, just a day after being formally elected Boeing chairman as of Feb. 1, 1997.
""We're seeing Boeing evolve from kind of a stodgy company to being very aggressive, nimble,"" said Bill Whitlow, a longtime Boeing analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who praised Condit's energy and stamina.
Executives at the two companies said the deal would be additive to operating profits immediately and reiterated their prediction that Boeing could achieve $1 billion in annual savings without any layoffs because of rapid growth.
Analysts said the merger was a good strategy for McDonnell Douglas, which already had announced plans to pull back from commercial aviation when it was eliminated from bidding for the Pentagon's 21st century joint strike fighter.
But Harry Stonecipher, chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, denied that the merger was born of desperation.
""This is the deal we wanted and we are very happy with it,"" Stonecipher told CNBC. ""This is the only deal we considered.""
Boeing executives told analysts they had no immediate plans to make further acquisitions, even though the combined company will generate cash flow of more than $4 billion a year on projected 1997 revenue of $48 billion.
The surprise merger immediately turned up the heat on Europe's Airbus Industrie to move ahead quickly with a restructuring plan. Without such a plan, the consortium would be unable to go ahead with a proposed super-jumbo aircraft to compete with Boeing's 747, which now is unchallenged at the profitable top end of the market, analysts said.
""Airbus Industrie and its partners must agree as soon as possible on an optimal structure that will allow Airbus Industrie to match its American competitors as a powerful, integrated European enterprise,"" German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said in a statement.
Analysts noted that Boeing had ended any chance that Airbus would partner with McDonnell on a new large jet, and some said Boeing's own plans to stretch the 747 might now be deferred.
But both Airbus and Boeing could benefit from stabilized airplane prices with the No. 3 player out of the market.
Despite some overlapping businesses, including helicopters, rockets and missiles, experts saw little possibility the deal would be stopped by the Defense Department, although the combination of the nation's only manufacturers of commercial jets could give pause to federal antitrust regulators.
""It will be interesting to see what the airlines have to say about this,"" said Don Baker, a former antitrust official now with the firm Baker and Miller in Washington.
""It's worth remembering that there would be just two players in the worldwide market for big planes,"" he said. ""But maybe two is enough competition for the airlines.""
On the defense side, analysts said they expected the marriage of Boeing and McDonnell to spur further consolidation, with players such as Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. looking for partners.
Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said the deal gives Raytheon, which supplies missile systems, ""a window of opportunity"" to buy Hughes Electronics Corp..
""It's not a long-term window,"" he said. ""It will probably last until the (Boeing-McDonnell) deal is closed.""
"
14,"Microsoft Corp. faces increasingly stiff competition and some skeptical corporate customers as it launches the latest version of its hugely profitable Office suite of applications.
Company Chairman Bill Gates has predicted Office 97 will be the biggest upgrade ever in percentage terms for the market-dominating product, which has an installed base approaching 50 million users including component applications such as Word and Excel.
While early reviews of Office 97 have been positive, industry analysts said corporate users in particular will take a hard look before deciding whether the dozens of new features are worth an upgrade investment of $200 per seat or more.
""Corporations are realizing they don't need to upgrade their office suite environment nearly as often as Microsoft would like them to,"" said Michael Pinckney, research director for the Gartner Group.
By most estimates Microsoft dominates the market for desktop productivity suites, capturing more than 90 percent of revenues.
Office and its component applications have been a key driver for the company's earnings, contributing some $1.8 billion of Microsoft's $8.4 billion in sales for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1996, estimated analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.
He projected Office would account for nearly $3 billion of a total $10.2 billion in revenues this year.
""There's no question, it's enormous,"" he said.
In addition to its financial importance the new Office is filled with Internet hooks designed to drive broader acceptance of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, ""so it's an important product strategically,"" McAdams said.
But Microsoft, which will launch the product Thursday at a glitzy media event featuring Gates on the stage of New York's Alice Tully Hall, faces increasingly aggressive competition from Canada's Corel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus unit.
Corel, which uses WordPerfect word-processing software as the core of its suite, made a significant dent in Microsoft's retail market share in the second half of last year, according to PC Data.
""Corel has proven that if a competitor has the right offering at the right price point, even Microsoft is vulnerable -- at least temporarily,"" said Liz Buyer of T.Rowe Price in a newsletter.
And Corel has gotten a jump on the market by announcing a new version of its suite based on Java, the Internet-friendly programming language.
Analysts say the emergence of network computers and their ""thin client"" applications pose no immediate threat to Microsoft Office, which demands over 100 megabytes of hard disk space for a standard installation.
""Over time you will move toward a more Internet-intranet driven model, where the basic applications reside inside your Internet structure and you download it as you need it, but that's going to take a few years,"" said Tim Bajarain, president of Creative Strategies consulting.
In the near term, the biggest threat to Office 97 is intertia, analysts said.
Most Office users take advantage of only a small percentage of features as it is.
Analysts are divided on whether significant demand will be driven by Office 97 features including a built-in system to track appointments and phone numbers and animated assistants to guide users through tasks.
More importantly, many large enterprise users have not upgraded to the Windows 95 or Windows NT operating systems, which are required to use Office 97.

15,"Members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum must accelerate liberalisation in the fast-growing telecommunications sector, an Australia official told an APEC meeting on Wednesday.
Telecommunications Minister Richard Alston said the world's US$2.0 trillion telecommunications and information technology market presented huge investment opportunities.
""APEC leaders and ministers have...consistently confirmed a clear agenda for APEC to liberalise the telecommunications environment,"" Alston said told the meeting of APEC telecommunications ministers.
""This meeting aims to accelerate this agenda by identifying areas where further work is needed and by endorsing new forward looking intiatives,"" he added.
Total global telecommunications investment for 1996 is estimated to be about US$161 billion, said John Legere, president and chief executive officer of AT&amp;T Asia Pacific.
Australia's telecommunications industry, meanwhile, was growing faster than the nation's economy -- a similar story to other APEC nations, Alston said.
The U.S. telephone giant, which has a presence in every market in the Asia Pacific, is keen to expand in the region through further investment, Legere told Reuters in an interview.
""Asia-Pacific is by far the fastest growing area in the world. The telecommunications services per density is the lowest in the world. AT&amp;T sees Asia-Pacific as one of the key markets it needs to tap into for future growth,"" Legere said.
Legere said the industry investment opportunities would be diverse, from mobile communications to fixed telephone lines, as well as the Internet, on-line and entertainment services.
Australia's Alston gave a local example on the investment opportunities that have been created since the country started deregulating its telecommunications market in 1992 and which is to be fully deregulated by July 1, 1997.
Australia's two largest telecommunications carriers state-owned Telstra Corp and Optus Communications are investing A$7.5 billion on laying their respective fibre optic cable networks to carry telephony, on-line and interactive services.
""We shall continue to pursue and encourage private sector investment and provide for a liberalised telecommunications environment,"" he said.
Indonesia is also in the process of opening up its telecommunications market and had attracted a large flow of funds as a consequence, said Jonathon Parapak, secretary general of Indonesia's telecommunications department.
Parapak told Reuters that Indonesia, which has a low fixed telephone penetration rate, planned to invest over US$10 billion, with most of the funds coming offshore, in the five years leading to 1999.
""We needed this foreign investment as we knew we could not do it by ourseleves,"" Parapak said.
Indonesia had at the end of 1995 1.7 telephone lines per 100, but the country plans to have five telephone lines per 100 people by the year 2000, Parapak said.

15,"The Australian government appointed stockbrokers on Thursday to manage the proposed sharemarket float of its telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp, which will be the nation's largest privatisation.
The float is estimated to raise a minimum of A$8.0 billion (US$6.32 billion) -- and perhaps much more.
Finance Minister John Fahey said he wanted the Telstra float, through the sale of a third of the government's 100-percent stake, to go through by the end of the year.
""I want it ready to go to the market this year, this calendar year,"" Fahey told reporters.
""But I am not saying it will,"" he said. He added it was unclear whether the float of other international telephone companies would affect the float timing. France Telecom and Italy's state-owned Stet are also planned for sale this year.
Australian brokers J.B Were &amp; Son, U.S.-based CS First Boston and European based ABN AMRO/Rothschild had been appointed global co-ordinators for the float, Fahey said.
He said J.B Were, Ord Minnett of Australia,  CS First Boston, U.S.-Australian consortium Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank, Daiwa of Japan, ABN AMRO/Rothschild and German owned Deutsche Morgan Grenfell were appointed joint lead managers.
The float would not be underwritten in Australia, where 65 percent of the offer is to be sold. But the shares offered in the United States would be underwritten and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the minister said.
Two percent of the offer is set aside for Telstra employees and foreign investors are entitled to 35 percent.
Fahey would not comment on how much the government expects to raise from the partial sale of Telstra. ""I want to get optimum value for taxpayers of Australia,"" Fahey said.
Australia's Liberal-National Party coalition government was elected just over a year ago promsing to sell one-third of Telstra, with A$1.0 billion of the sale proceeds going to set up an environment fund.
The float of Telstra will far exceed other privatisations by the Australian government in recent years. The sale of Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised a total of A$8.0 billion, in two separate tranches, and the 1995 float of Qantas Airways Ltd raised A$1.45 billion.
The announcement was a boon to Australia's stockbroking community whose Christmas bonuses will be swelled by the Telstra float. The bidding for the Telstra deal was contested by 30 broking firms, which were invited to lodge proposals.

15,"Australian government-owned Telstra Corp reported a 38.4-percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half as the costs of shedding almost a third of its workforce started to ring up for the telephone carrier.
Telstra, which is to be partially privatised by the end of the year, also said it was in talks with global telecom carriers about forming possible alliances.
""We are dancing with everyone, but we haven't taken anyone home from the dance yet,"" chief executive officer Frank Blount told reporters after the results announcement.
The Australian carrier reported a net profit after abnormals of A$742.0 million (US$585.4 million) in the six months to December 31, 1996, compared with A$1.20 billion a year ago.
Redundancy costs were A$1.03 billion in the half-year period with staff levels down by 7,000 during the half to about 69,500. Under Telstra's plan announced last September about 22,000 jobs are to go by the end of fiscal 1998/99.
Revenue grew by 4.6 percent to A$7.77 billion in the December half. Blount said first-half revenue was pressured by a slowing economy and increased competition.
It was unlikely revenue would grow any faster for the rest of the year to June 30, 1997, Blount said.
""I think the economy is picking up, but we are still seeing softness in revenue, but it is still growing about the same level as in the first half,"" Blount told reporters.
Telstra is to face stiffer competition in 1997/98 due to the deregulation of the local telecommunications markets from July 1, 1997, although few foreign telecom groups so far have openly stated they would enter the Australia market.
British Telecom Plc (BT) and U.S. telecom giant AT&amp;T Corp have, however, been tipped to enter the local market.
Blount said Telstra had been in talks with BT and its partner MCI Communications Corp, AT&amp;T Corp and the Global One consortium about possible alliances.
""We have had talks with Global One...we have had talks with AT&amp;T...and we have continuing talks with BT/MCI,"" Blount said. Excluding the abnormal losses, Telstra reported a 16.1-percent rise in net profit to A$1.40 billion.
The result was well received by the Australian government, which said the partial Tesltra float is still on for the end of 1997. The government gets to pocket A$625 million in dividend payments from the carrier.
""I think the company is very well placed for privatisation,"" communications minister Richard Alston told reporters in Canberra. ""We're still hopeful that (the sale) will occur before the end of the calendar year,"" Alston said
The government last year moved to sell one-third of Telstra for a projected A$8.0 billion, but recent estimates put the sale price much higher.
Telstra is spending about A$3.5 billion on the rollout of its cable network around Australia, which carries its pay television service Foxtel that it owns jointly with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.
Telstra's share of losses from Foxtel in the half was A$49 million, finance director Paul Rizzo told reporters.
""I am not concerned about the losses of Foxtel, because they are not that far off track, they are very close to plan,"" Blount said. ""Of course we are having losses in pay TV, that is the business,"" he said.

15,"Canadian media baron Conrad Black said on Wednesday he wanted to increase his stake in Australia's oldest newspaper group, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd, to 50 percent from 25, a day after meeting the prime minister.
However, Black repeated that he would sell out of Fairfax if there was no easing in Australia's current media ownership rules, which he described as ""anachronistic"".
Black said that although he could not rule out selling his stake to Kerry Packer, the suggested merger plan by Packer between his media empire and Fairfax was unlikely to suceed.  
Black told shareholders at Fairfax's annual meeting that he had said to John Howard in their first meeting since Howard became prime minister that he would like to raise his stake, which is held through Hollinger International Inc.
Black was asked by reporters after Fairfax's meeting just how much he would want to increase his stake to, if allowed. ""Fifty percent,"" he said.
The media baron added that U.S. accounting rules effectively punished companies which had higher than 50 percent stakes in their associates. However, Black repeated that he would sell his Fairfax stake if he was not allowed to raise it further.  
""If the road is truly blocked, then obviously we are going,"" Black said. He added that Hollinger would not lodge any application for a higher stake until the government ended its study into media ownership and presented new ownership rules.
Under Australia's current media ownership rules, foreigners are prevented from owning more than 25 percent of a newspaper group or 15 percent of a television group. They also prevent a newspaper group owner from owning more than 15 percent of a television station in the same city and vice-versa. ""These thing as they are now are very anachronistic,"" Black told reporters.  
In August, Packer's main media group, Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) proposed a merger between PBL and Fairfax only if media ownership rules were liberalised. PBL owns top-rating Nine Network and 15 percent of Fairfax.
Black said PBL's merger proposal was unlikely to succeed while he (Black) was a shareholder. ""He (Packer) would have quite a time getting that one through,"" Black said.
""I don't ever rule out anything, but I think that's fairly improbable. If Mr Packer wants to control Fairfax he's going to have to it the old-fashioned way and pay for it."" Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd owns five percent of Fairfax.  
""I know he's averse to doing that,"" Black said. He added he was not particularly interested in any stock swap deal with Packer which would leave him with a PBL stake.
Black said John Fairfax's profits were starting to improve.
Fairfax reported a 41 percent fall in net profit to A$87.4 million in the year to June 30, 1996.
""It's starting to look a little better now. Profits are affected by increased newsprint, they are affected by increased depreciation because of the plant at Chullora, cash flow rates are starting to improve a little bit,"" Black said. Fairfax spent A$330 million on a new printing plant at Chullora in Sydney.  
Fairfax chairman Sir Laurence Street told shareholders the slower Australian economy coupled with higher newsprint prices would impact on the group's final results for the 1996/97 year.
""Coupled with the state of the economy, Fairfax, in common with the whole newspaper industry, has had to face high newsprint prices and this, too, will impact upon our final results in the current year,"" Street said.
At 3.45 p.m. (0435 GMT) Fairfax shares were two cents higher at A$2.69, giving it a market capitalisation of A$2.04 billion.

15,"Singapore's Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan said on Thursday that APEC members must strike a balance between liberalising their telecommunications market and maintaining local control.
""One of the things we are discussing, what are the benefits of liberalisation, as opposed to the need to protect local companies from being swamped,"" Mah said after addressing Asia Pacific Economic Coooperation (APEC) forum telecommunications ministers here.
""The benefits of liberalisation are clear, but also we need to balance that benefit with making sure that it is not just foreign companies that make all the profits,"" Mah told Reuters in an interview.
""So that is part of the bargaining, of discussions, that is taking place in this meeting,"" said Mah, who has offered to hold the next meeting of APEC's telecommunication and information technology ministers in Singapore in mid-1998.
Mah said there were massive investment requirements in the infrastructure of the region's telecommunications industry, with most of this investment likely to come from the private sector.
""In dollar amounts there is a lot of money to be invested, but the question is, who gets to take part in that investment,"" said Mah, who will be in talks with other APEC telecommunications ministers until Friday.
""If you take everybody into account there are a lot of investment opportunities and this is one of the areas of potential, not just for our (Singapore) companies but for companies in other countries like America, Canada, Australia and Japan,"" Mah said.
In May, Mah brought forward Singapore's plans to end the local telephone monopoly by state-controlled Singapore Telecom to the year 2000 from 2007. However, Singapore plans to open its cellular phone market to competition next year.
Last month, Mah also announced a further sell-down of Singapore Telecom, which will leave the government owning 75 percent of the telephone carrier.

15,"The aggressive cost cutting programmes planned by Australia's two major airlines Qantas Airways Ltd and Ansett Airlines Ltd can be achieved without affecting services, analysts said.
Both Qantas and Ansett face pressure on profits because of the stronger Australia dollar, higher fuel prices, a soft domestic market and competition in the international market.
""Australian airlines are seen as high cost operators compared with the rest of world,"" said Peter Harbison, managing director of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation consultancy service.
""So I suppose there is scope there to reduce the cost base,"" Harbison told Reuters.
Qantas, which is 25 percent owned by British Airways Plc, announced at its annual meeting last month that it will increase its cost cutting programme by about A$100 million for the 1996/97 year on the previous target of A$330 million.
Ansett, which is a joint venture between News Corp Ltd and Air New Zealand Ltd, said three months earlier that it plans to cut A$150 million from its annual cost base of A$3 billion.
""They will have to reduce their costs along with every other airline in the world and that will continue to happen for some time,"" Harbison said.
Investors are focusing on Qantas, which is cutting costs more aggressively so that it can meet profit estimates.
Qantas has said it aims to cut costs right across the airline, without specifying particular areas.
Analysts said Qantas will have plenty of scope to cut costs, using its alliance with major shareholder British Airways to share facilities.
""They have got a lot of inefficiences, they can outsource some of their engineering and maintenance,"" said Greg Ward, aviation analyst at First Pacific Stockbroking.
Analysts said the Australian flag carrier will also cut costs in areas where it is not so noticeable to customers, such as in the accounts and marketing and sales departments.
""It's the tail that Qantas will hack into, Qantas will not hack into the sharp end,"" said David Turner, analyst at Shaw Stockbroking, referring to accounts and sales areas as the tail, while the sharp end was the flight services.
He said Qantas is very competitive with other world airlines in terms of its pilot performance and aircraft ultilisation, so there is little change seen in those areas.
Analysts said Qantas has to focus on cutting costs in order to grow profits and release funds for the expansion of services and purchase of new aircraft.
""They haven't got the capacity to go out and buy planes and fill them up and fly hundreds more routes so the focus is on improving their balance sheet and generating more profits to do that,"" one Melbourne-based aviation analyst said.
However, analysts said both Qantas and Ansett run a risk in cutting costs as it may affect staff morale, which in turn affects customer service and in turn customer loyality.

15,"Australia's largest listed aluminium producer Comalco Ltd reported on Monday a 72 percent slide in net profit for the first half of 1996, due to a weaker metal price and a stronger Australian dollar.
The lower than expected result saw metal analysts trim back their 1996 full-year profit estimates for Comalco, while investors wiped over five percent off the miner's share price.
Comalco, 67 percent owned by the world's largest mining group CRA Ltd/RTZ Corp Plc, reported a net profit of A$43.9 million (US$34.7 million) for the six months to June 30, 1996, down from A$155.1 million a year earlier.
""Lower primary aluminium prices, movements in the exchange rate, softer alumina markets and weaker alumina spot prices affected profit,"" Comalco chief executive Terry Palmer said in a statement.
The three-month aluminium contract traded on the London Metal Exchange has fallen nearly 13 percent to its current level of US$1,479.0 from the start of the year, while the Australian dollar has risen seven percent to around US$0.7900.  
Comalco's sales fell 31.6 percent to A$806.9 million for the half, due mainly to lower metal prices. The tough market conditions would continue into the second half, Palmer said.
""I think we are already a third of the way through the second half and I think we have got to expect it to be tough because even if the prices (of aluminium) improve next month it would be hard to get much gain out of it,"" Palmer told Reuters.
Shareholders are likely to be disappointed with the result, as the Melbourne-based miner slashed its dividend to three cents a share for the first half, from 12 cents a year ago. This was well below expectations of five to six cents a share dividend.
""It is a lot lower than what people were expecting,"" Macquarie Equities metals analyst Peter O'Connor told Reuters.
Investors reacted to the weak result by slicing five percent or 33 cents off Comalco's share price. The stock closed at A$7.10 on Monday, its lowest level since August 1.
Australian aluminium analysts said they would further cut their 1996 full-year profit forecast for Comalco, which produces about 17 percent of the nation's primary aluminium, 10 percent of the country's alumina and 21 percent of its bauxite.  
At the start of 1996, analysts forecast Comalco to report a net profit of between A$255 million and A$265 million for 1996, compared with the 1995 profit of A$232.3 million.
Lower metal prices and a stronger Australian dollar saw analysts trim their full-year forecast to around A$130 million prior to the half-year result.
But in light of Monday's six-month result, analysts further lowered their forecast to around A$90 million for the 1996 year.
""You would have to expect that numbers would be coming down to at least double of what the first half was,"" O'Connor said.

15,"Australian government-owned airport operator Federal Airports Corp (FAC) sees some life after the planned privatisation of its 22 airports, chief executive officer Barry Murphy said.
""We will eventually go out of existence if all 22 airports that we currently own and operate are eventually disposed of to other owners,"" Murphy told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""One thing we do hope will survive is our service group called the FAC Airport Consultancy, which we are trying to build into a viable business for the long run,"" Murphy said.
Murphy said FAC Airport Consultancy would be a group of 20 or 30 people, with specialist knowledge of the aviation industry and property management.
""We hope to sell those services at arm's length to the remaining airports and to new airport owners,"" Murphy said.
The Australian government has 10 consortiums shortlisted for bidding in its first sale phase which consists of 50-year leases for Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports. These are expected to sold in early 1997.
The sale of Adelaide lease was supposed to be part of the first phase, but was delayed for an upgrade.
The remaining 18 airports, including Sydney and the yet-to-be-built second airport at Sydney, will be sold in one or more future tranches.
""By the year 2000 I would imagine that they would have all gone with the possible exception of Sydney, if that is held back because of the Olympics,"" Murphy said.
Sydney will host the 2000 Olympics Games.
Murphy said the sale timetable was uncertain and the whole process was quite unsettling for FAC staff, as one of the major problems for the corporation was staff leaving to join the various consortiums.
Former FAC chief executive Jack Moffatt is the acting chief executive of Australian Airports Ltd, a consortium bidding for Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.
In late November, FAC reported a 14.5 percent rise in net profit to A$78.1 million in the year to June 30, 1996 on a 14.6-percent rise in revenue to A$579.3 million, while passenger volume at the airports grew 7.3 percent.
""Passenger growth seems to be holding up quite well and we are expecting a continuing strong performance in that area...and we are hopeful that kind of growth rate will continue,"" Murphy said.
""We are confident that revenue growth would follow similar growth.""
Murphy said the FAC would try to minimise capital expenditure ahead of its privatisation, although Sydney airport may need to be upgraded. ""We do expect significant work at Sydney to cater for terminal growth within in the two years.""
Sydney is Australia's busiest airport.
Murphy said the FAC had been in talks with freight operators with a view to expand freight facilities at some of Australias airports.
""It is apparent now that freight is attracting more interest,"" Murphy said. However, he added any expansion of freight facilities was unlikely to involve major sums of money.

15,"Australia's oldest newspaper group John Fairfax Holdings Ltd is expected to unveil sharply lower 1996/97 half year earnings on Friday, but analysts say the results may show the worst is over.
Media analysts contacted by Reuters estimated Fairfax to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$37 million and A$42 million for the first half. Fairfax reported a 23.2 percent fall in net profit to A$62.43 million for the 1995/96 half.  
However, they said the result should show improving advertising revenue in the second quarter, along with lower newsprint costs.
""They have certainly seen a pick up in ad volumes. It is still down on last year but nowhere near as much down as in the first quarter,"" said Nola Hodgson, analyst at HSBC James Capel. Hodgson tips a net profit of A$38 million to A$39 million, with the dividend remaining at 3.5 cents for the half.
Vince Pepe at broker Burdett Buckeridge and Young estimated Fairfax to report a net profit of A$40 million for the half and A$75.1 million for the 1996/97 year.  
Fairfax reported a net profit before abnormals of A$102 million in the 1995/96 year (July/June).
Fairfax profits have been tumbling for the past 18 months on higher newsprint costs and falling advertising revenue, the latter a sign of a weak labour market.
""The pick-up in the ANZ job ads was some encouragement,"" Pepe said.
On Monday, the closely-watched ANZ job advertisment series for January rose a seasonally adjusted 3.3 percent, the largest gain in a year.  
""Ad volumes are still down, but we are starting to see signs of life in real estate and employment,"" James Capel's Hodgson said.
One Sydney-based analyst forecast Fairfax to report a net profit of A$37 million, while another, who also asked not to be named, estimated the newspaper publisher to report a net profit of A$42 million.
Analysts were mixed about the second half as the first six months is traditionally Fairfax's stronger with advertising volumes associated with the Christmas period usually boosting the bottom line.  
Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) owns about 15 percent of Fairfax and has never been shy of his intention to own Fairfax.
""This is not a company about earnings. The key issue is whether Packer is going to make a bid for it,"" the analyst said.
Canadian media baron Conrad Black sold his 25 percent Fairfax stake last year, frustrated by the government's refusal to change foreign ownership laws for Australian media assets, which prevented Black from securing 50 percent control as he wished.  
Analysts expect Fairfax to report an annual net profit of between A$75 million to A$84 million, an indication that some are forecasting a stronger second half.
Fairfax's classified advertisments, which were dubbed by media baron Rupert Murdoch as ""rivers of gold"", are often viewed as a reflection of the Australian economy. Most economists tip the local economy to grow stronger in 1997.
However, another media analyst, who also asked not to be named, said the market was not really concerned about Fairfax earnings and was instead preoccupied with a potential change in Australia's media ownership laws, which are under review.  
Black sold a 19.9 percent stake to New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd. Brierley plans to buy the rest of Black's stake if its gets Fairfax shareholder approval at a meeting on February 24.
Fairfax shares closed four cents lower on Tuesday at A$3.04.

15,"Australian government plans to toughen the rules for the rollout of optic fibre cable could make Optus Communications' cable rollout plans uneconomic, said Optus chief executive officer Zygmunt Switkowski.
""We looked at the technology and the economics of underground cabling and we can't make the business case work for us,"" Switkowski told Reuters, before addressing a luncheon at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia.
""It could certainly add hundreds of millions of dollars to our cost base,"" Switkowski said.  
Last week, the Australian government said Optus and Telstra Corp would need the approval of a local council before it could install cables in its jurisdiction.
Optus, through its 46.5 percent owned Optus Vision, is rolling out fibre optic cables overhead on mainly existing telephone poles to carry pay television and telephone services at a cost of around A$3.0 billion.
Switkowski said there was no overall figure on how much extra it would cost Optus for the underground cables.
""It can be three to six times more costly to roll out an underground cable than it is to roll out an aerial cable.""  
However, Switkowski said the government's decision had not affected the group's cable rollout programme.
Optus has targetted 2.3 million homes to be cabled by the end of 1996. ""Everything is going according to plan,"" he said.
Switkowski played down newspaper reports that the telecommunications group would take the government to court over its change in policy.
""I think the suggestion that the rules under which have established this corporation should change earlier than expected is an unsettling one,"" he said.
The new cable rollout rules start on July 1, 1997.  
This is the same day that Australia's telecommunications industry will be liberalised, allowing overseas telephone carriers to provide local telephony services.
Australian Communications Minister Richard Alston announced the cable rollout changes last week, following lobbying by some lcoal councils and back-benchers in his own conservative Liberal party who wanted the roll-out restricted or stopped.
Alston said cable operators would not be able to install overhead cables where there had previously been no overhead cables and would have to go underground when above-ground power cables in that street went underground.  
Several councils have taken Optus Vision to court, but the rollout has continued because it is permitted under the current telecommunications regime.
Switkowski said he could make no comment on Optus Communications planned sharemarket float, which is scheduled to list by the end of this year, but has been delayed by legal action between Optus Vision and Seven Network Ltd.
Optus Communications is 25 percent owned by Mayne Nickless Ltd, BellSouth Corp and Cable and Wireless Plc both have a 24.5 percent stake in the Sydney-based group.
The balance is owned by Australian institutions.

8,"Tears flowed and eight bells tolled at a farewell for the Royal Navy in Hong Kong on Friday as Britain shut its HMS Tamar naval base in an end-of-empire retreat leading up to the colony's July 1 return to China.
Except during the Japanese occupation between 1941 and 1945, eight bells have rung three times a day for more than 100 years at HMS Tamar, marking the Royal Navy's watch over one of Britain's most prized colonial possessions.
First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jock Slater, Governor Chris Patten and other dignitaries spoke of dignity and pride as the White Ensign was lowered, furled and folded at the base on Stonecutters Island in Hong Kong harbour.
""The White Ensign has just been lowered over this shore base but the values that it has stood for will, I hope, remain in this place: respect for law and for person, trust, duty and service,"" Patten told more than 200 sailors.
""But there is no cause for thinking sad thoughts, that there is dishonour in these endings. Nothing has melted away. There have been no defeats,"" Patten said.
""What the Navy has done is help to provide the stability that enabled commerce and industry to flourish and let Hong Kong develop into what it is today,"" said Commander Oliver Wright, who served 40 years with the Royal Navy from 1941 to 1981.
In a ceremony that drew tears from oldtimers saddened by the decommissioning of Britain's last naval base east of Suez, more than 200 seamen in stiff, white uniforms marched through the gates to an upbeat rhythm set by the Royal Marines' brass band.
HMS Tamar shut 100 years to the day that a vessel of the same name first arrived in Hong Kong waters. Its closure ended a 156-year association between the Royal Navy and Hong Kong.
The first naval officer to set foot in Hong Kong was probably Sir Edward Belcher, who landed on 25 January 1841 and drank to Queen Victoria's health on Possession Mount on Hong Kong Island. The Union flag was raised the following day.
Many younger naval officers were pragmatic about the end of such a long relationship,
""Hong Kong's time is up,"" said radio operator Steve McSevich. ""It's reverting to Chinese rule and there's no shame in that. The Chinese will leave it pretty much as it is.""
China, whose navy will occupy another site on Stonecutters Island, was not represented at the ceremony, another sign of the stalemate in Sino-British negotiations as the transition nears.
The only Chinese present were locally hired personnel, many of whom now have until June 30 to find new jobs.
The future of the HMS Tamar site is uncertain, but the three Peacock class patrol craft based there have been bought by the Philippines, which will take possession soon after July 1.

8,"Increasing signs of an economic upswing in China have raised the question of how far speculation can be held responsible for a sudden flush of liquidity sweeping through China-related stocks in Hong Kong.
Brokerage W.I. Carr on Thursday said that improving economic fundamentals in China could be at least partly responsible for the red chip fever that has fuelled Hong Kong's outperforming stock market for months.
Dismissing any suggestion of a speculative bubble ripe for collapse, it said the soaring rally in Hong Kong red chips, or companies with financial backing in China, confirmed the beginning of a long and strong business cycle in China.
""The market is telling us something about where the Chinese economy is going and where company earnings in China are going in the future,"" said John Mulcahy, managing director of Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities in Hong Kong.
Red chips have gained on expectations of big returns from strong connections and asset injections by parents, often municipal and provincial governments. Many are trading at more than 35 times 1997 earnings, compared with the average Hong Kong blue chip ratio of 15.
Much of the rally is driven more by ""a wish and promise"" than evident earnings performance but growing signs of economic recovery in China suggest economic fundamentals could also be playing a role, Mulcahy said.
Corporate restructuring, rising productivity, disinflation and strong exports are far more responsible for strong Chinese markets than a sudden burst of liquidity from central bank credit easing last year, said economist Michael Taylor.
""Just as in other bull markets, this market is probably telling us something,"" Taylor said.
""And I believe the evidence is coherently pointing to ... the start of a long, sustained business cycle here based on restructuring and being characterised by disinflation and good trade performance,"" he said.
But Dong Tao, senior regional economist at Schroder Securities, disagreed. He said market rallies in Hong Kong and on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges were being driven by liquidity seeking better returns than those offered by a depressed Chinese industrial sector.
""I don't think a turnaround in company profits will arrive this year. I haven't seen a turnaround in demand. I haven't seen that the price wars hurting companies' bottom lines are over,"" Tao said.
China's economy is currently split between a struggling real economy, dominated by debt-laden and loss-making state-owned enterprises, and excessive liquidity, he said.
Timing is the key, Tao said. China is still struggling with flat domestic demand and huge overcapacity following the 30-percent growth rates in fixed asset investment that marked the booming early 1990s -- but that will end at some point.
Taylor argued that improvements are already surfacing, with cuts of up to 15 percent of the workforce in places such as Shanghai linked to rising productivity -- boding well for an early improvement in corporate earnings growth.
But the risk of disinflation throughout Asia threatens to undermine China's gains and puts pressure on exporters to stimulate the real economy, Taylor said.
Chinese media recently reported that exports are not expected to maintain the 26.9 percent growth rate recorded between January and April this year.
China's focus on exports to solve its economic problems has excerbated political tensions, with the China-U.S. trade surplus expected to exceed US$50 billion this year compared to about US$40 billion last year.

8,"A Royal Navy warship, bristling with weaponry, took up position on the Hong Kong waterfront on Monday to serve as a floating nerve centre for Britain's end-of-empire retreat in just 29 days time.
Dodging flimsy sampans and commuter ferries chugging about the famously crowded harbour, the multi-role frigate HMS Chatham berthed beneath glassy skyscrapers alongside the Prince of Wales barracks in the heart of the metropolis.
There it will tick away the hours, assuming the role of command centre for the British military withdrawal, until China takes back Hong Kong at the stroke of midnight on June 30.
After the historic handover, the Chatham will escort the departing Royal Yacht Britannia, with Prince Charles and colonial governor Chris Patten on board, out of Hong Kong.
Braving one of the hottest and steamiest days so far this summer, Captain Christopher Clayton said he and his crew looked forward to performing an historic task with pride.
""There is no sense of withdrawal,"" Clayton said.
""This is very much one professional armed forces handing over the protection and sovereignty of Hong Kong to another, the People's Liberation Army. So I look on it as a classic military evolution and one which we hope to do with some style, orderly and professionally.""
The arrival of the type 22 frigate coincided with a 21-gun salute by the navy's HMS Plover patrol ship on the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation, which the Chatham honoured by ""dressing overall"" in a busy selection of flags and signals.
With just 29 days to go, the frigate's arrival was the latest piece in the jigsaw puzzle of preparations for Britain's withdrawal from the pearl of its colonial possessions.
The drawdown of the garrison, a highly visible expression of the end of British sovereignty, has already cut its strength to little more than 1,000 from 10,000 in the early 1990s.
And while the British are leaving, the Chinese are arriving.
The latest contingent of 90 PLA troops drove across the border on Friday, boosting an advance guard already in place to 206 unarmed soldiers, here to get garrison facilities ready.
Offering them friendship, Clayton said the Chatham hoped to host PLA officers on board his ship.
The frigate, designed to assume flagship duties, bristles with advanced weaponry including Harpoon anti-surface missiles and Sea Wolf missiles. She also carries Sea King helicopters.
The Chatham is in the Asia-Pacific region as part of a larger 1997 task force deployment, codenamed Ocean Wave, involving a dozen vessels including the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and two nuclear submarines.
""This is not a regrettable occasion,"" said Robert Curry, a signal communications officer.
""It's an end of an era, certainly, but I don't think there should be any regret or shame at all.""
The Chatham's nimble sailors in crisp, white suits shinnied up and down the ship's narrow galleys and stairwells, outlining all its guns in loving detail to bedraggled, thirsty visitors stumbling over unexpected nuts and bolts.
""As you can see, we are not a cruise ship. We are definitely a warship,"" said principal warfare officer Phil Haslam.

8,"Institutional investors applauded China's attempts to cool down stock market speculation last week but warned that Hong Kong's volatile reaction was unlikely to end any time soon.
""Undoubtedly, the very considerable volatility requires someone to be very brave indeed to participate, and it will continue to remain that way for quite some time to come,"" said Stewart Aldcroft, director of sales and marketing for Templeton Franklin Investment Services (Asia) Ltd.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index of blue chip stocks closed Friday's see-saw session up 188.21 points or 1.35 percent at 14,112.55 following a total drop of 907 points in five consecutive trading sessions ending on Thursday.
The index swung wildly on a variety of factors, including China's move to curb speculation, jitters about the property market and a downgrade by Merrill Lynch.
As usual of late, the real action was in red chips, that unruly bunch of China-related stocks that have taken investors on a roller-coaster ride since February.
The sector, made up of companies with financial backing from China, responded very badly to news that Beijing intended to clamp down on the stocks, many of which listed in Hong Kong with promises of future asset injections of uncertain value.
Now trading in excess of 30 times 1997 earnings, the red chips have outperformed the rest of the Hong Kong market by a wide margin. But last week they shed about one-third of the gains they have made since January, according to one estimate.
""The extent to which there has been speculation about which red chip is going to get the next asset insertion and how valuable it will be has clearly got out of hand,"" Aldcroft said.
Templeton and other international institutions with established valuation criteria have avoided the sector while retail and smaller brokerages leapt on board, speculating about the value of promised assets and connections.
How do you establish a multiple for influence? one asked.
Although the larger institutions appear to have steered clear on these sorts of concerns, plenty of smaller funds have invested, according to funds authority Micropal.
China fund performance figures to June 6 show GT up by 56.6 percent, Barclays up 51 percent, ImPac up 47 percent, Nomura and Guinness Flight up 45 percent, Invesco up 38 percent, HSBC up 35 percent and Jardine Fleming up 34 percent.
""You couldn't get that type of performance if you hadn't been invested in red chips,"" Aldcroft said.
But both Jardine Fleming and HSBC said they limited their exposure to the biggest and most credible red chips.
""Among them there are good quality companies with solid earnings growth,"" said Jardine Fleming investment director Patrick Wong, who put JF's red chip weighting at 15 percent.
Prudential Asia's senior portfolio manager, David Descalzi, said he had avoided the sector completely -- a difficult position to take when profits were there to be had.
""No fund manager likes to be left behind,"" he said. ""But there has to be a recognition that this is speculative and there will be a correction, which is what has happened.""
But Prudential is buying into market weakness, and Descalzi said if the red chips run again, they will be harder to ignore.
""Hong Kong is still one of the only viable stories out here, with the possible exception of Korea, and we want to take advantage of that,"" he said.

8,"Hong Kong is among the world's most efficient economies but its continued success as a global financial centre and entrepot is far from certain, Harvard-based economic adviser professor Jeffrey Sachs said on Monday.
Uncertainty associated with the British colony's return to Chinese rule next year could compromise Hong Kong's leading position as the world's most competitive economy behind Singapore, said Sachs, whose Harvard Institute of International Development produced the Global Competitiveness Report 1996.
""I'm not predicting doom and gloom,"" Sachs, an adviser on economic reform to governments around the world, told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Hong Kong.
""I'm just saying that if you want to maintain a high-precision, finely-honed, world-class financial and trading centre such as this there isn't that much room for playing around.""
Hong Kong will continue to flourish past the transition only if the rule of law is strictly observed, media freedoms are upheld and the economy remains completely open, he said.
But only time will tell whether the commercial underpinnings of Hong Kong's successful, highly-complex and capitalist economy will be maintained, he said.
""After Chinese sovereignty comes in July 1997 we're going to see whether the judicial system remains independent, whether the media remain free, whether there's ample opportunity for the full flow of financial and economic and political information that is vital for an entrepot of this kind,"" he said.
Sachs also adopted a cautious view of China's economic promise, warning that its economic institutions need drastic overhaul in order to maintain high rates of economic growth beyond the short-term.
""These institutions are not good enough to carry China toward long-term growth. China's dynamism now is undoubted and it's not going to come klunking to a halt, but it's based on the fact the starting point is so low,"" Sachs said.
Cheap labour, low taxation and access to foreign exchange along China's coastal regions have fuelled the world's most impressive exports boom, Sachs said. But in order for that momentum to be maintained, China must clarify property rights, develop financial markets and establish legal certainty.
""The Chinese government is going to have to run very fast and keep very clear sights on its goals in order ... for institutional change to keep up so that the goal of high growth can be sustained in the future,"" Sachs said.
A major obstacle to long-term success is the state enterprise sector, which employs 20 percent of the population. While it is not sufficiently large to submerge the entire economy, the state enterprise sector is a definite drag on the economy and poses a risk to the entire financial system, Sachs said.
Sachs lauded China's efforts so far to privatise businesses at the local and regional levels.
""Parts of China are reforming from the bottom up with local and regional governments making experiments in privatisation that can be models for the rest of China,"" he said.

8,"Tigers ready to pounce or a litter of clawless wannabes?
Surrounded by the burgeoning states of Asia, Hong Kong is wondering just how long it can rely upon its traditional strengths -- proximity to China, developed markets, a huge and free port -- for prosperity into the next millennium.
Rival tiger states from Singapore to Jakarta are sharpening their claws and developing fast, preparing for China's arrival.
They are growing so fast that financial powerhouse Hong Kong has started to wonder how well-prepared it is to defend its position as China's primary financial service centre.
An inadequate education system, declining standards of English, rising costs and an under-skilled labour force are just some of the hurdles facing Hong Kong -- and grabbing the attention of some of Asia's youngest and fiercest tigers.
TIGERS UNSHEATH THEIR CLAWS
Tokyo and Singapore pose the most immediate threat.
Tokyo's loss of business to lower cost, less regulated rivals such as Hong Kong and Singapore was one of the key motivations for the shake-out now hitting Japan's financial sector, termed the Big Bang.
Many of the reforms will take effect before the 2001 deadline, allowing Tokyo to claw back business from Hong Kong's grasp - but the process could take a while, analysts said.
""Immediate gains may not be so large,"" said Takashi Kiuchi, head of economic research at LTCB Research Institute Inc.
Despite Tokyo's obvious size and strength, Singapore is considered the Asian tiger with the sharpest teeth -- and time is on its side.
""Tokyo is still in the early stage of its liberalisation program,"" said Eddie Lee, economist at Vickers Ballas in Singapore. ""And in five to 10 years time, Singapore would have an earlier foothold in the Chinese market. The Japanese at this point are still trying to sort out their balance sheets. We'll have an advantage.""
The city-state has already lured many Asian headquarters from Hong Kong either directly, or by luring those companies that might previously more naturally have gone to Hong Kong.
But Singapore should not get too complacent. Lurking on the horizon lies tiger cub Kuala Lumpur, one of Asia's most promising and aggressive financial centres.
Malaysia's political stability, plentiful cheap office space and political will to deregulate financial markets are attractive for multinationals seeking an Asian location.
Malaysia is cheap, dynamic and motivated, with rentals one-third of those in Singapore and one-quarter of Hong Kong's.
""It's very obvious that the infrastructure is being put in place, put in place very rapidly,"" said Patrick Tan, assistant director at ABN Amro Hoare Govett in Kuala Lumpur.
""Right now we're number three (behind Hong Kong and Singapore) but it's a question of time and momentum. It's not a question of how many years but more a question how fast - what sort of volume can be built up in the next couple of years.""
Even Taipei, undeterred by political awkwardness with China, will be watching Hong Kong carefully over the coming months and years for signs of a loss of openness and evenhandedness.
And Jakarta is working hard to build its role as an Asian middleman for international investors.
""Our investment banking industry is growing at the moment and investment banks from the United Kingdom and the U.S. are coming here,"" said Agung Prabowo, analyst with Indonesia's state-owned brokerage PT Danareksa Sekuritas.
""We do play a middleman role that can facilitate the new ideas or debt securities or equity securities, and there are investors here as well who can absorb new issuance.""
HONG KONG THREAT WITHIN NOT WITHOUT
Despite all the enthusiasm, economists warn that China's smooth economic emergence should not be taken for granted.
Growth rates in China are declining as the nation grapples with massive structural problems.
And the sort of problems afflicting Hong Kong also weigh on other regional centres.
""Hong Kong's probably got more or as many well-qualified people as anywhere else in the region, and also, this economy has managed to adapt itself very well over the years,"" said Simon Ogus, economist at SBC Warburg in Hong Kong.
The greatest threat to Hong Kong comes not from outside but within, Ogus warned.
""The key question for Hong Kong is: does the underlying legal regulatory structure under which that (China) business is conducted change. In which case, there will be a loss of competitiveness relative to other countries,"" Ogus said.
"
8,"With the World Bank forecasting a 20-percent increase in Asian energy demand each year for the next decade, one could be forgiven for viewing the entire Asian power stock sector as a good bet.
Wrong.
Uncertainty in the form of rapid change looms over one of Asia's most important equity sectors, making short-term value hard to find, analysts say.
Just some of the wild cards include the privatisation of state utilities, a plethora of new, independent power producers (IPPs) and a diverse and government-controlled tariff structure.
""There is an escalation of the risk/reward ratio of power investments, given the massive changes the industry is undergoing,"" said BZW Asia Research analyst Thomas Chesser.
""A number of project-specific, speculative issues are turning once predictable, stable and defensive power investments into high-risk, high-reward plays.""
STOCK SELECTION CRITICAL
Longer-term, many Asian power companies are bound to offer strong returns with estimated demand requiring 2,000 megawatts more capacity each month for a decade, implying annual investment of more than US$35 billion.
But all analysts agree stock selection will be critical to avoid a variety of short-term hazards.
In the past, Asian power stocks tended to track regional markets, but over the next few years up to 40 percent of all new generating assets will be derived from IPPs, creating much greater divergence in share price performance.
Valuations will also come under pressure from a flood of new equity. Within the next two years, the  Electric Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and  National Power Corp in the Philippines are both due for privatization, with another three privatisations in the next four years.
The privatisations will join a slew of new equity from the US$5.5 billion Bakun hydroelectric dam project, YTL Corp Bhd and  Port Dickson Power in Malaysia,  Beijing Datang Power Generation Co and Huaneng Power International in China and Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) in South Korea. In total, a flood of about US$2.5 billion in new paper will hit Asian markets this year.
""While increasing the alternatives available to investors, it is probable that new supply will reduce premiums accorded to already-listed companies,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Hilary Judis wrote in a recent research report.
HIGH PREMIUM STOCKS SET TO FALL
Valuations are also expected to rationalise following Southern Electric's US$2.7 billion acquisition of Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd (CEPA) last October.
The deal's premium of 15-percent to net present value provides a new international benchmark that could speed up an evening-out of domestic stock valuations. Many stocks trading at high premiums can expect to fall sharply.
""What CEPA has done is call attention to market transactions. A lot of people will view it as a benchmark for value against domestic valuations,"" Chesser said.
""It's only been three or four months so we haven't seen the trickledown come through yet, but some of the dearer IPPs will see the premiums come down. This is not just intuition but based on a survey of fund managers,"" he added.
KEPCO GETS BUY RECOMMENDATION
While analysts all commend careful stock-picking as the only safe route through this maze, their recommendations vary widely -- with one notable exception: KEPCO enjoys a buy recommendation from virtually every Asian analyst.
As the sole government-owned and operated utility in South Korea, KEPCO enjoys a virtual monopoly on electricity generation and transmission in South Korea, accounting for 95 percent of all electricity generation last year.
The stock, with a 12-percent weighting on the Seoul stock market, fell in line with the broad sell-off in South Korean shares in the second half last year before making a breathtaking recovery this month.
Despite expectations of weak 1996 earnings from higher fuel prices and a punishing foreign exchange rate, KEPCO is now trading at about 27,000 won against a 12-month low of 23,800.
Analysts said the stock appears to have priced in expectations of a 28-percent decline in 1996 earnings and now is trading in anticipation of a much better year in 1997, aided by a tariff increase and improved fuel prices.
""Although any further depreciation in the won will likely not be helpful to KEPCO we expect the decline in oil prices to more than compensate,"" said Caroline Rogers at Merrill Lynch.
CHINA'S HNP FAVOURED, EXPANDING
China's Huaneng Power International (HNP) is also favoured by most analysts, but it does not enjoy KEPCO's universal popularity.
Merrill Lynch said HNP, with the highest valuation among the four Chinese power companies, is known for its strong relationships -- always important in Asia -- and a quality management led by Li Xiaopeng, the son of China's premier Li Peng. Li senior runs the State Council, overseeing capital expenditure and tariff increases.
HNP is expanding its existing four power plants to 6,200 megawatts over the next five years from 1,900 megawatts now, boosting annual earnings growth by a projected 24 percent.
Most analysts also like Hong Kong and China Gas for its stable earnings growth, China exposure and property investments. But Hong Kong Electric and China Light and Power received a mixed response thanks an uncertain regulatory environment, unstable earnings outlook and problems with overcapacity.
Manila Electric Co in the Philippines is also popular as a monopoly with good exposure to an accelerating economy. But some analysts warn the stock's valuation, formerly justified by strong profit growth and positioning, will have to change to reflect no more tariff increases until the year 2000.
And while some expect Meralco to benefit from the privatisation of National Power Corporation, which is run by many ex-Meralco personnel, others see increased investor choice eroding Meralco's share premium.
Analysts are neutral to negative on Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional Bihad, which faces a loss of its monopoly on transmission and distribution, uncertainty surrounding any tariff increases, and the possibility that the government will demand that the company provide a rebate to customers damaged by a recent blackout.
"
8,"Economic commentators in Hong Kong are sounding alarms about the unbridled optimism spurring stock and property prices to new highs ahead of the British colony's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.
Concerns are mounting that rising price pressures could inflate a collapsible bubble on the assumption that China will support Hong Kong's economy through the transition regardless of any political disruption.
""The term 'moral hazard' refers to the apparently growing belief in local markets that there is little dramatic down-side risk -- as opposed to short-term volatility -- because ultimately China will suppport Hong Kong markets,"" Ian Perkin, chief economist with the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.
In contrast to earlier fears that political uncertainty could torpedo Hong Kong's economy in 1997, domestic confidence in China's determination to keep the economy stable through the transition is so high that an unexpected problem has arisen -- price instability.
Economists are starting to revise upward their inflation forecasts for 1997 in response to booming stock and luxury property prices.
""The outlook for 1997 is going to be less good than we thought,"" said Kevin Chan, economist at Salomon Brothers.
Salomon has raised its 1997 forecast for the territory's benchmark consumer price index to 7 percent from 6.6 percent late last year, and Chan said further increases are possible.
Sudden strength in Hong Kong's stock market in the middle of last year was welcomed as proof of confidence in the colony's future under China, and evidence of an economic turnaround following an export slump early last year and three years of austerity in China.
But the optimism became concern in November when speculation emerged in the luxury end of Hong Kong's property market.
Citing anecdotal evidence, Perkin argued that overseas and domestic investors confident of China's commitment to economic stability in Hong Kong are rushing to buy high-end properties in anticipation of short-term gains.
The Hong Kong government has since strongly supported a set of anti-speculation measures by the Real Estate Developers Association, and warned it will step in if there are signs that speculation is filtering down to the middle or low end of the property market.
But economists said property price volatility would eventually stimulate overall inflation, even though it has been restricted so far to the high end of the market.
""This will not be good for inflation expectations,"" Chan said. ""In general, people will expect the higher prices in the luxury sector to affect medium and small flats.""
Chan estimates an overall rise of 30 percent in property prices will translate into at least a 15 percent increase in rents this year, which account for 25 percent of the Hong Kong government's benchmark consumer price index.
Food prices, which account for 37 percent of the index, are expected to rise by at least 8 percent this year after holding steady last year.
Hong Kong will also suffer from its currency link to the U.S. dollar. If the United States raises short-term interest rates this year by one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point, as many expect, real rates in Hong Kong -- the difference between nominal rates and inflation -- will fall to about 1 percent, Chan said.
Such low rates will propel growing momentum in both private consumption and retail sales.
China, with its well-documented aversion to the socially destabilising effects of inflation, has done little to stoke further exuberance over Hong Kong's post-1997 economy beyond saying it backed Hong Kong's currency link.
""There seems little doubt Hong Kong's new sovereign wants to see the local economy prosper throughout the year of transition and in the early years of its resumption of sovereignty,"" Perkin wrote. ""It (is) probably true that it does not want to see the local economy going on a speculative spree that will eventually run out of steam and cause a collapse.""
"
8,"U.S. interest rates have been the focus for most investors in Asia lately, but one key development that has escaped much notice is the increasing divergence of the region's markets, Guinness Flight Asia Ltd said.
""Investors are becoming much more discerning, and market performance across the region is now highly divergent,"" Guinness Flight said in its second quarter Asian outlook.
""Rather than simply investing in Asia, funds are flowing to those markets where the investment story is strong and avoiding those where it is weak,"" the fund manager said in the recently released report.
This placed a greater onus on fund managers to get their asset allocations correct.
It was too easy for investors get caught up in the hype about the ""Asian growth miracle"", but rosy expectations for earnings growth have traditionally been linked to high headline rates for gross domestic product growth and less to what companies have been achieving, it said.
""High levels of bank lending growth and overheating property markets can also produce flattering results in the short term, but the longer-term sustainability of such earnings growth is more questionable.""
But long-term growth was available, it said. Asia is a highly dynamic region, but some growing pains are inevitable, reflected in the cyclical slowdown in a number of key export industries or structural problems in Thailand and South Korea.
""Nevertheless, companies that are well-managed and well-positioned have an excellent environment in which to prosper,"" Guinness Flight said.
To gain access to that growth, investors need to have a clear idea of which markets are the strongest. Stock picking has become increasingly important, it said.
By focusing on companies that constitute the bulk of index capitalisation, investors may miss many of the best opportunities. This partly reflects the undeveloped nature of these markets where blue chips account for the lion's share of turnover, commission and research, the report said.
Concentrating on small and medium-capitalisation stocks is time-consuming and difficult because the information sources are fewer, but Guinness Flight argued it was essential.
""Management quality is the key criterion,"" it said. ""This is very much 'growth investing' as good sustainable earnings growth and strong cashflow are indispensible if a company is to be successful and provide a good return to shareholders. Asia is a growth story and this is where it is happening.""
Guinness Flight called China a key prospect. Although tiny as an equity market, China has profound influence and a slow easing of monetary policy there boded well for the earnings outlook of Chinese companies over the next few years.
Guinness Flight is holding an overweight position in Hong Kong and raising Singapore to overweight in expectation of an electronics recovery. It is moving to underweight in Malaysia following greater economic uncertainty there.
Indonesia remains overweight on strong economicdomestic liquidity. The Philippines has been cut to underweight on a deteriorating current account, while South Korea continues to fail to address structural problems.
Thailand has shown no real signs of recovery, although indications are that the market may have reached its bottom, the report said.
The following is Guinness Flight's second quarter percentage weightings against the Morgan Stanley Capital Index Asia ex-Japan. (Figures in brackets show Guinness Flight's weighting versus Morgan Stanley's weighting):
Overweight: Hong Kong (34 vs 26.5), China (1 vs 0.5), Indonesia (7 vs 6.5), all unchanged. Singapore, increased (14 vs 12.5). Neutral: India, increased (7.0 vs 7.0), Philippines, reduced (4 vs 4), South Korea, (5 vs 5), Thailand, (5 vs 5) both unchanged. Underweight: Malaysia, reduced (16 vs 20), Taiwan, increased (7 vs 11.5).

8,"The arrival in Hong Kong next week of a contingent of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) carries a symbolism far outweighing the numbers involved -- 40 unarmed soldiers.
After long and painful negotiations, Britain and China announced on Tuesday that in less than a week the PLA personnel would arrive in the territory as an advance guard prior to Britain's formal handover of the territory to China.
The sovereignty switch is not until the stroke of midnight on June 30, but the PLA personnel, who will not wear uniforms outside their barracks and will have no security role, will be an emphatic mark of Hong Kong's transition.
""This is the real thing. And the PLA, of course, has a central role in China and that also gives it significance,"" Michael DeGolyer political analyst at Hong Kong's Baptist University, told Reuters.
The diplomatic status of most other Chinese representative offices in Hong Kong, such as Xinhua News Agency and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, had on occasion been uncertain, he said.
But there is no confusion about the status of the PLA. It is China's designated protector of both party and state.
""It will be interesting to see who they talk to,"" DeGolyer said. ""It would be appropriate to pay a courtesy call on the chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
""And it would be symbolically significant for the chief executive to meet with them simply because they are the first establishment of an official representation of sovereignty in the territory,"" he added.
Tung was appointed by China in December to become the first post-colonial leader, succeeding colonial Governor Chris Patten.
Details of the PLA deal were welcomed by some of those who had been previously alarmed by reports that a heavily armed advance guard might march into the territory before July 1.
Memories of the 1989 Beijing massacre, in which PLA soldiers crushed pro-democracy protests with heavy loss of life, remain vivid in Hong Kong.
""The PLA issue has been highly sensitive. At least they managed to persuade them not to come in heavily armed before July,"" said independent Democrat Emily Lau.
But senior government sources warned against reading any new mood of Sino-British reconciliation into the announcement.
""Politically, it's a minor sign they can agree on things but it really doesn't change things. I don't see any major turning point in this in terms of relationship,"" said PLA expert and political analyst Tai Ming Cheung.
In fact, there are increasing signs of strain in the Sino-British relationship.
On Monday, Beijing unilaterally announced who would qualify for permanent residency in Hong Kong after July 1.
The move prompted a rebuke from Britain for announcing a go-it-alone decision on an issue that it said should have been settled diplomatically.
Sources close to Patten said China cared less about the right of abode than it did about forcing the recognition of a Beijing-backed Provisional Legislature.
China insists that the provisional chamber will pass the residency law rather than the territory's existing elected Legislative Council, due for extinction on July 1.
Signs of a Sino-British standoff are evident everywhere as the colony's endgame unfolds and Britain, perceived by most Hong Kong people as increasingly irrelevant, packs its bags and prepares to leave town.
The only mainland China representation on Tuesday at a Foreign Correspondents Club reception for diplomats was a low-ranking Chinese official.
Xinhua director Zhou Nan, his senior deputies and China's chief handover negotiator Zhao Jihua, all stayed away.

1,"Rescuers struggled on Saturday to recover scores of bodies from the wreckage of a bus that plunged down a deep ravine in the Colombian Andes.
Red Cross officials said 37 people -- all members of a single extended family -- died in the crash and just three passengers survived, including a nine-month-old baby.
The bus ran off the road and plunged into a 1,500-foot (500-metre) chasm in a remote area of Narino province on Friday morning.
More than 50 volunteers took part in the rescue, which was made difficult by the extreme mountain conditions and hampered by thick fog and intermittent rain.
Rescuers were taking at least two hours to recover each body and Red Cross spokesman Mario Arias said it could take three more days to pull all the victims out of the ravine.
""The conditions are very dangerous and rescue work had to be suspended overnight and could only begin again at first light,"" Arias told Reuters in a phone interview from Narino, on Colombia's southern border with Ecuador.
""Rescue workers are having to abseil or scramble down into the ravine with the aid of ropes. The situation is just atrocious. It's taking us roughly two hours to bring each body out,"" he added.
The accident occurred near the town of Ricaurte as the bus travelled from Cali, the country's second-largest city, to Tumaco, a small port on the Pacific coast.
Arias said one of the survivors, Ana Maria Arboleda, 16, told him the vehicle swerved off the road when the driver, who died in the crash, tried to avoid rocks that had fallen on the highway.
Arboleda, her uncle Ambrosio Arboleda, 44, and nine-month-old Brian Montenegro were flung out of the bus as it rolled into the chasm. She suffered a broken arm and a cracked rib, and her uncle was only slightly scratched, Arias said. The baby has a cracked skull and is undergoing a series of emergency operations, Arias said.
Relatives and neighbours of the dead mourned the victims in their home city of Cali.
""This a tragedy. All these people were part of the same family,"" neighbour Eduardo Quinceno told the NTC TV news programme. All the dead worked in a small, family-run shoe factory, according to the Red Cross.
The fatal bus crash is the second in 10 days in Narino. Fifteen people died and 18 others were injured when a local bus flipped over and dropped into a ravine on Dec. 23. The latest accident is one of the worst in recent memory.

1,"Colombian lawmakers bowed to intense government pressure on Thursday and put the bite back into a bill to strip drug barons of their ill-gotten gains.
If the legislation survives a congressional plenary vote -- likely to be plain sailing after a stormy passage -- it could go some way to appeasing the United States, which has threatened to slap economic sanctions on Colombia for its perceived failure to crack down on billionaire drug barons.
A conference committee hauled the asset forfeiture bill back from the brink by reversing a decision by the lower house which would have taken the teeth out of the law.
In a narrow vote on Tuesday, the House of Representatives rejected the provision, previously approved in the Senate, that would empower the government to seize drug-related assets accumulated over the last 20 years.  The House ruled the law could only be retroactive to 1991, leaving much of the property amassed by the jailed Cali Cartel kingpins, estimated at more than $50 billion, untouched.
Justice Minister Carlos Medellin, who like a handful of other top ministers spent much of the day lobbying key lawmakers in the halls of Congress, was buoyed by the committee's decision.
""Now we just have to see if the plenary session of the Senate and Chamber of Representatives approves the decision. But I don't think there will be any problem,"" he said.
Colombia's business community also heaved a sigh of relief. It had campaigned for Congress to approve the 20-year time limit in a series of pleas over the last two days. Key export sectors of the economy are likely to be hardest hit if U.S. sanctions are imposed.
Even though the asset forfeiture law now seems to have reached high ground, the road back into the good books of the United States still promises to be rocky.
Political analysts agree there is little chance of Colombia regaining certification as a U.S. ally in the drug war, which it lost last March, even if it escapes threatened sanctions.
Other anti-drug legislation which the United States has demanded, such as stiffer sentencing and the reintroduction extradition, have been watered down or sunk in Congress in recent weeks.

1,"A powerful car bomb exploded in the northwest city of Medellin early on Monday, killing one woman and injuring at least 15 other people, police chief Gen. Alfredo Salgado said.
About 120 pounds (50 kg) of dynamite was packed into a minibus and detonated outside the house of Juan Gomez Martinez, a regional newspaper editor and former provincial governor.
Four unidentified gunmen opened fire on private security guards near Gomez's home before the bomb went off about 5:30 a.m. (1030 GMT), Salgado said.
The dead woman was named as Lucia Bernal, 60, the wife of a civil engineer, who lived close to the site of the blast. Gomez was not home at the time but one of his three sons, Juan Camilo, was injured.
""We don't know the motive for this attack. It is too early to say who was behind it. We don't know if it was leftist guerrillas, drug traffickers or right-wing paramilitaries. We're looking at all the possibilities,"" Salgado said.
Gomez, a member of the opposition Conservative Party, is head of the regional El Colombiano newspaper, which has its headquarters in the industrial city of Medellin, the main city of Antioquia province.
In recent days it has been serializing an extensive interview with Carlos Castano, leader of the country's most-feared right-wing death squad, whose main target is leftist rebels and their suspected supporters.
A few hours after the bomb blast a hitherto unknown group, calling itself the Special Anti-Paramiltary Commando, issued a communique, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, declaring war on paramilitary groups in Antioquia.
The organisation, claiming to be made up of ex-guerrillas who had laid down their arms, accused serving state governor Alvaro Uribe, of the Liberal Party's right wing, of sponsoring the paramilitaries. Uribe lives close to the site of Monday's blast but it was not clear whether the communique and the attack on Gomez's house were linked.
Medellin has in the past seen some of the worst violence unleashed by the country's powerful drug cartels. It was the scene of multiple attacks by the notorious drug mafia led by the late Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The cocaine kingpin waged war against the state in a successful bid to force Congress to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.
Last week Congress approved a tough new law designed to strip drug lords of their illicit billion dollar fortunes. More measures including stiffer jail terms are due to be debated in an extended session of Congress this week.

1,"Oil giant British Petroleum Co Plc is involved in a ""conspiracy of silence"" over human rights abuses in eastern Colombia, European legislator Richard Howitt alleged on Friday.
But the British Labor Party representative to the Euro- Parliament admitted, after a week-long fact-finding mission to the country, that he had no evidence directly linking the multinational to the deaths of social leaders in Casanare province close to BP's operations.
BP's Colombian subsidiary, British Petroleum Exploration (BPX), has consistently denied charges of links to rights abuses committed by right-wing paramilitaries and the army. In a statement issued on Friday, it ""energetically"" condemned all violations carried out against civic leaders in the area.
""BP is involved in a conspiracy of silence and should take a more active stance in favor of human rights ... it may be that BP staff have a direct liability in these actions or it may not be the case,"" Howitt, a member of the Euro-Parliament South American affairs delegation, told a news conference.
""But I find it impossible to believe that BP managers are not aware of these human rights abuses committed in their name if not by them directly,"" he added.
The claims against BP were fueled by a series of articles in the British press in the last year based on a multi-agency report drawn up in 1995. That report documented the murders of seven peasant or social leaders, most of whom had protested against BP's operations in the area since they began in 1991.
BP is not mentioned by name in the report's conclusions, and the killings were attributed to paramilitaries and the army.
A statement issued by BP Thursday said: ""BP rejects energetically human rights abuses from whatever quarter and has publicly condemned the deaths of civic leaders and others in Casanare.""
""BP categorically rejects the accusations made by Howitt. He has a great responsibility to make sure that these claims are fully founded,"" it added.
BPX head John Doust asked Colombia's Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso to investigate the claims fully to show it had nothing to hide. Valdivieso opened an inquiry last month but told Doust in a letter that he had no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by the British company.
Howitt also accused BP of failing to spend enough on the local community in Casanare. BP figures show it spent more than $17 million between 1991 and 1996 on social, education, education, environmental and infrastructure programs.

1,"Colombia's main oil workers' union, USO, known for its fierce nationalism and opposition to multinationals, has merged with a smaller labor organization in a bid to create an industry-wide front, one of its leaders said Tuesday.
The new grouping will target workers not currently represented by any union, primarily those employed by foreign companies operating in the country, USO social security secretary Gustavo Triana said.
The merger vote took place late Monday in the oil production center of Barrancabermeja and has set alarm bells ringing in some sectors of the industry, which fear the USO's spreading influence could sour labor relations with the non-unionized workforce.
""The merger was unanimously agreed and this opens a new phase of union organization in the oil industry. We will try to enter into those sectors where there is little or no union presence,"" Triana said. ""The multinationals have already spoken out against this grouping and we think they will show a great deal of resistance and look for ways to keep it out of their fields.""
The USO has about 5,700 workers and has until now only been able to recruit within the state oil company Ecopetrol. But the merger with the small ASOPETROL, which already has a foothold in the multinationals, will pave the way to what USO chief Hernando Hernandez believes could be a 40,000-strong ""super-union"".
Triana said the new union would not only cover production and refinery workers but could also extend to contractors and those involved in transport and distribution operations related to the oil industry.
SINTRAOXY, which represents multinational Occidental Petroleum's workers, is expected to join USO and ASOPETROL, Triana said.
USO, formed in the 1920s, has accused foreign multinationals of undermining national sovereignty through its production and exploration contracts with Ecopetrol. It has also attacked them for exploiting Colombian workers.
For their part, some of the multinationals believe USO has ties with Colombia's leftist guerrilla movements -- a charge its leaders deny.
A foreign oil spokesman said last week: ""The prospect of having to deal with a belligerent union with close ties to the guerrilla movements is far from stimulating.""
Another contacted Tuesday said his company was analyzing the merger decision, saying: ""It may be something we can live with. It's surprising what people who want to earn a dollar will put up with.""
Last week, the USO staged a 24-hour strike which paralyzed pumping operations along Colombia's two main oil pipelines.

1,"Leftist guerrillas appeared on Wednesday to have eluded government troops and melted into the mountains after a four-day battle in which 16 soldiers and at least 13 rebels were killed.
Bombers flew over the combat zone 30 miles (50 km) east of Bogota late on Tuesday, but first light on Wednesday brought no repeat of the massive air strikes of the day before. The rattle of sporadic gunfire had died down and villagers displaced by the fighting were considering returning home.
The clash between the army and Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) rebels began late last Friday and ended in one of the worst defeats for the military since the FARC overran a military base in southern Colombia in August, killing 27 soldiers and taking 60 as prisoners.
The FARC, which was still holding the soldiers, sent the Caracol radio network proof of their survival on Wednesday, including recent photographs of each of the 60 soldiers and letters from 59 of them to their families.
The Defence Ministry on Tuesday said 16 soliders died in the San Juanito fighting and 13 to 15 rebels were killed. Most of the army casualties came as soldiers disembarked from two helicopters in an area known as El Tablon in search of a rebel column and were met by a hail of guerrilla gunfire.
Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper said the soliders quickly ran out of ammunition and some preferred committing suicide with hand grenades to being taken prisoner by the rebels.
There was no confirmation from the troops in and around San Juanito on Wednesday but many voiced discontent with their commanding officers and what they described as the unnecessary bloodshed in El Tablon.
""It was madness for our officers to fly helicopters into that area. The soldiers were hardly out of the door before they were gunned down,"" one soldier said.
Some of the 400 villagers displaced by the fighting were preparing to return home on Wednesday. Most were worried about feeding the chickens and guinea pigs they keep for food and some wondered if they would still have homes after recent heavy aerial bombardment.
Ligia Gutierrez, a mother of seven, was among the displaced villagers who said she feared reprisals by the military. ""The army is bound to come looking and trying to find out which of us have been feeding the guerrillas.""

1,"Colombia's Senate approved on Thursday a controversial bill that would partially lift the country's six-year-old ban on the extradition of drug traffickers and other criminals.
A plenary session voted 53-14 in favour of the bill, which still faces more congressional hurdles and if successful would only become a statute toward the end of the year.
""I'm very satisfied because we had a big vote in favour of the motion,"" Justice Minister Almabeatriz Rengifo said after the session. ""This will be the last step to removing a constitutional ban (on extradition) which is what we have been fighting to do.""
Critics, however, say the original government-sponsored bill has been so watered down that it is virtually useless and is unlikely to impress U.S. anti-drug officials who have been pushing the Colombian government to push through an unconditional extradition law.
The bill must still be submitted to two more debates in the Lower House of Congress before June 20 and four more after mid-July.
If it survives intact it would forbid extradition if alleged criminals surrender to the Colombian authorities or if they face tougher penalties abroad than they would under the notoriously lenient Colombian justice system.
There are clear signs the proposal faces a rough passage in the Lower House where a similar bill foundered late last year.
""We're not in favour of a totally free or licentious extradition law. Nobody believes in the Gringos indictments with their false witnesses and everything else,"" said Giovanni Lamboglia, Liberal Party member and chairman of the Chamber of Representatives. He said he would be pressing for the bill to be watered down even further.
Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia, a respected member of President Ernesto Samper's cabinet remained optimistic and said the government would likely press to toughen the proposal after July 20 and even consider whether it could be applied retroactively.
The vote came on the day Virgilio Barco, former president who led his country through one of the most violent periods of drug-related violence in the nation's troubled history, was buried in Bogota. The 75-year-old statesman died on Tuesday after a year-long battle with stomach cancer.
As president between 1986 and 1990, Barco is the only Colombian leader to have ordered the extradition of one of the country's top drug lords to the United States.
He bundled Carlos Lehder, one of the masterminds of the infamous Medellin drug mob, off to a U.S. court in 1987 where a judge sentenced him to life without parole plus 135 years.
The move was one of the catalysts that led Pablo Escobar, the late Medellin cartel kingpin, to unleash a savage war against the state and forced a constitutional ban on extradition in 1991.

1,"Hefty budget cuts are sounding the death knell for Colombia's efforts to reverse social inequalities and undermine guerrilla movements in the poorest areas of the country, politicians and analysts say.
President Ernesto Samper announced in January that he would slash 1.3 trillion pesos (about $1 billion) from the 1997 budget to rein in a yawning fiscal deficit. He pledged that social spending and public works would not be affected.
But Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo said earlier this week that more than two-thirds of the spending cuts would hit precisely those sectors the president said would be spared.
A central plank of his 1994 election platform was the so- called ""social leap forward"" that aimed to end the chronic isolation of many rural communities, virtually cut off from the rest of the country by poor access and communications.
""This is a significant step backwards for the social leap. The social programme has been failing for some time, and these cuts leave it virtually dead,"" said ruling Liberal Party Sen. Luis Guillermo Giraldo.
He accused Samper of taking the easy route by cutting funds for health, education, hygiene, drinking water and rural programmes instead of pruning government bureaucracy that soaks up three quarters of the cash destined for social spending.
Political analyst Eduardo Pisarro doubted that the reduction in social spending would spark protests among Colombia's poor, who stand to be most affected by the cuts.
But he said it would do little to loosen the grip of Marxist revolutionaries, already estimated by some analysts and defence officials to have de facto political and economic control over 40 percent of Colombia.
""Colombia has traditionally had a weak welfare state and so the impact (of these cuts) will be much less immediate. But one can forsee that the guerrilla and other groups will maintain their capacity to recruit followers in pockets of poverty,"" said Pisarro.
Armando Montenegro, head of the influential National Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF), welcomed the cuts and believed they would stem the fiscal deficit that ran at 4 percent of gross domestic product last year.
He argued that the social impact would be minimal, saying: ""Social investment is so inefficient and there's so much waste that in any event the money would not have reached the poor people.""
Montenegro hoped the budget reduction would open the way for wider private sector participation in infrastructure projects, such as road building. But he thought few private firms would be interested in building roads to remote areas needed by peasant farmers to take their produce to market.
Agriculture and defence are the other areas that will bear the brunt of the cutbacks, although the revised budget for military spending of about $350 billion pesos will be more than doubled thanks to a cash injection from the mandatory sale of so-called ""war bonds"" to rich Colombians.
Individuals or businesses with a net worth of more than $85,000 are required to spend 0.5 percent of their funds above $85,000 to purchase five-year bonds, which the government is using to finance the military.

1,"A nationwide public workers' strike entered its second day in Colombia Wednesday, but it was soccer that brought the nation to a standstill.
Thousands of workers deserted picket lines to watch television coverage of a World Cup eliminator clash between Colombia and arch-rivals Argentina in the Caribbean port city of Barranquilla.
""There were meetings and pickets this morning but most people went home because the strike has more or less come to a halt because of the soccer,"" said Wilson Borja, leader of the public sector FENALTRASE union.
In a country full of soccer fanatics, a match featuring Colombia's undefeated World Cup contenders would understandably get a bigger draw than picket lines. But even the private sector ground to a halt as employees crowded around TV sets to watch the nail-biting match.
But some say the government has purposely used soccer in the past to deflect attention away from perceived or actual political crises.
""It goes back to the Roman times when emperors offered bread and circus to the people. The problem in Colombia is that there is circus but no bread for the masses,"" said Enrique Parejo, a former justice minister.
Few are better placed than Parejo to comment on the link between politics and sport.
He was justice minister, in November 1985, when leftist rebels of the now-defunct M-19 movement stormed the Palace of Justice in downtown Bogota, taking more than 300 hostages and prompting a violent counter-attack by the army.
At the height of the battle the government encouraged radio and TV stations to halt live broadcasts from the scene and transmit a series of soccer matches instead.
""I didn't take part in the decision but I think undoubtedly it was aimed at diverting attention from what was going on,"" Parejo said.
Likewise, on the first day of the nationwide strike by an estimated 800,000 state workers Tuesday -- which government officials predicted could spark widespread violence -- a state-run TV channel re-broadcast Colombia's 1993 5-0 soccer victory over Argentina in Buenos Aires.
""I think they did it deliberately to try and neutralise the strike and get people off the streets,"" Parejo said.
Underscoring the fanaticism surrounding soccer in Colombia, 120 people were murdered across the country in celebrations that followed that thrashing of Argentina four years ago.

1,"The Colombian authorities hailed Wednesday the U.S. pilot who was killed during an anti-drug mission over guerrilla-infested jungles of southeast Colombia as a ""hero fighting the scourge of narco-trafficking.""
Robert Martin, 35, of Lubbock, Texas, died when his Turbo Thrush T-65 crop dusting plane crashed in Guaviare province Tuesday. He had been fumigating illicit plantations of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
Colombian Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra, police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano and U.S. ambassador Myles Frechette were among mourners at a religious service in Bogota to honour Martin. A lone bugler played the ""Last Post"" and the U.S. flag was draped over Martin's coffin.
""We're not here to bid farewell to a pilot or to a U.S. citizen. We're here to say goodbye to a hero who decided to join us in combatting one of the worst scourges known to mankind -- narco-trafficking,"" Serrano said.
Police said Martin, one of six U.S. civilian pilots working in Colombia under contract with the U.S. State Department, was killed on the first day of his contract. Frechette said he was the first U.S. aviator to die on such a mission.
As police cadets mounted a guard of honour for Martin and three police helicopters flew in formation overhead, Frechette pledged the fatality would not affect U.S.-Colombian cooperation in the drug war.
The question of U.S. personnel taking a direct role in drug or counterinsurgency operations is a traditionally thorny issue because of what Colombian politicians see as the possible infringement of national sovereignty.
Crop-dusting planes come under frequent attack from armed gangs and leftist guerrillas who guard the clandestine drug plantations.
Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said Tuesday there was a heavy rebel presence in the area but said there was no indication the aircraft had come under fire. He said a full investigation was under way, adding the most likely cause of the crash was human error or mechanical failure.

6,"The British government on Tuesday said the design of Eurotunnel's freight trains would have to be scrutinised after a massive fire swept through one of its main tunnels, injuring eight people and causing wide damage.
British transport secretary Sir George Young told parliament he was sure the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel Safety Authority would look at the design aspects after warnings from British fire chiefs about the safety of the trains.
Any changes to the design of Eurotunnel carriages would be another costly blow to the Channel Tunnel operator which recently came back from the brink of bankruptcy after restructuring its nine billion pounds ($15 billion) in debt.
The fire, the first serious incident since the tunnel opened two years ago, halted services on Tuesday. Even if limited services resume on Wednesday, Eurotunnel warned that traffic capacity would be cut to one third of normal levels for an indefinite period.
The fire and worries about the extent of damage and a resultant safety review hit Eurotunnel shares.
In London, they closed down 4-1/2 pence at 87 pence while in Paris the stock dropped 1.28 percent to 7.65 francs per share. But trading in its debt was barely changed.
One freight customer TNT Express Worldwide said it would be relying more on ferries as a result of the fire.
Eurotunnel confirmed in a statement that 15 heavy goods vehicles and the rear locomotive had suffered ""severe"" damage.
The fire was reported to have started in a goods carriage carrying a truck holding flammable polystyrene but Eurotunnel said the cause had not yet been determined.
The goods vehicle shuttles have partially open sides - the safety of which had been questioned by the British fire brigade some years before.
Mike Frattini, fire officer and spokesman for the Kent Fire Brigade which helped put out the fire, told Reuters earlier: ""Our chief officer warned the safety committee (for the tunnel) five years ago.""
He suggested that fire fighters could raise this issue once again with the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority.
Eurotunnel's spokesman refused to comment on whether changes will need to be made to carriages, adding that: ""It is a key question.""
A spokesman for the Department of Transport told Reuters that past concerns about the safety of these carriages had led to Eurotunnel carrying out safety tests two years ago. ""They were then approved in May 1994,"" he said.
Apart from possible safety changes, Eurotunnel faces other heavy costs.
The first is lost revenue due to reduced traffic. A Eurotunnel spokesman in London told Reuters ""We will operate at one third of normal capacity and we will give priority to Eurostar (passenger) trains. But there will still be space for shuttle trains as well."" He did not say how many Eurostar or Le Shuttle trains would be cancelled as a result of the fire.
Eurotunnel confirmed in a statement that 15 heavy goods vehicles and the rear locomotive had suffered ""severe"" damage. ""It is a serious accident,"" chairman Patrick Ponsolle said.
A Eurotunnel spokesman said the cost of repairs was not yet known. ""It's quite messy down there. There will be damage to the overhead powerline cables, the heat will have buckled the steel rails and the carriages involved would be very badly damaged and may need to be replaced,"" he said.
The cost of a new goods train is 25 million pounds, but Eurotunnel said it did not think an entire train would need replacing. It faces costs in repairing tunnel and rolling stock damage and may face compensation costs, possibly involving paying for customers to travel by ferry or air, although the company said it is heavily insured.
The fire comes just before Christmas when the tunnel was expecting a surge in holiday sales. But pre-holiday publicity now consists of media reports of choking people emerging from smoke and ""blow-torch""-like heat.
Asked whether this would dampen customer demand, Eurotunnel said ""We hope not. But what's happened has happened and how the fire was handled should renew confidence in our safety procedures,"" said the press officer. ($1=.5970 Pound)

6,"The UK construction industry expects to get the cold shoulder from the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister)again this year, with industry leaders predicting continued cutbacks in infrastructure spending in next Tuesday's budget.
Building industry leaders say they expect no more than a few crumbs from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke next week and are forecasting even more pressure on roads spending, with some rumours that Clarke will take a further slice off the road budget this year.
""If ever there was going to be a budget with severe cuts, it's this one, which needs to make room for pre-election tax cuts,"" said Graham Watts, chief executive of industry lobby group the Construction Industry Council.
As far as the housing market goes, builders are unanimous in their call for no sharp shocks to disturb the market's equilibrium. That means steady inflation and interest rates, plus no more reduction in mortgage interest tax relief, groups like the Building Employers Federation say.
On the spending side, The British Road Federation, embracing builders, motor groups and oil companies, said the road budget had been cut by 25 percent in the last two years.
""We expect to see a further contraction by 200 million pounds ($337 million),"" said Federation spokesman Mark Glover ""It's already been cut for the last four years.""
Spending on new roads and maintenance by government offshoot the Highways Agency was 2.04 billion pounds in 1994/95, falling to 1.75 billion pounds in 1995/96 and is expected to be down to 1.5 billion this financial year.
The forecast for the year 1997/98 is seen dipping again.
These cutbacks, plus reduced state investment in rail since privatisation, and the fact that hospitals are now under constrained regional budgets, have resulted in the building industry remaining in recession years after the rest of the economy moved into recovery, lobbyists claim.
Few industry leaders hope for a spending increase, but they would like to see a spending freeze at best.
The other issue on the construction industry's wish-list is for the Chancellor to break the log-jam holding up the private finance initiative (PFI) -- which aims to get private capital flowing into public sector projects.
The PFI has replaced a lot of fresh government spending, but the frequent hold-ups to project awards due to red-tape have

6,"Ford Motor Company Ltd, the U.S. carmaker's U.K. arm, said on Tuesday that the British sales outlook for 1997 looked pretty flat as customers suffered from a ""feeling-not-so-good"" factor.
Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford U.K., told Reuters in an interview at the British International Motor Show that weak sentiment was the primary reason for sluggish interest among UK consumers in the last three years.
""People were badly bitten by the recession and have become cautious about their own personal balance sheets,"" he said.
He added that it would require an end to consumer worries, like house owners' negative equity, and a cure for the recessionary hangover before the private car market took off.
Industry analysts have said that most of the growth in the UK car market has been due to companies buying cars, rather than the man on the street snapping up new models.
McAllister said company fleet sales would remain a priority for Ford in the coming year but said, ""We will reduce our exposure to the heavily discounted rental market.""
The UK chief agreed that the slight growth in sales across the wider European car market so far in 1996 had been distorted by government incentives in countries like France to trade in fuel guzzling old cars for new models, as well as heavy discounting by most car makers.
The underlying picture for the European car industry has been less promising, he acknowleged, agreeing that excess market capacity in Europe had fuelled downward pressure on margins for players across the board.

6,"British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group Friday clinched a British rail franchise and said it planned to spend an extra 250 million pounds ($420 million) on new trains and increased services.
He won control of the CrossCountry service, which covers more than 130 stations and is based in the central British city of Birmingham.
The company, with 842 employees and passenger revenues worth 108 million pounds ($181.3 million) in the year to March, is part of the national rail network that is in the process of being privatised.
""Virgin believes that it can be built into one of the prime rail franchises serving several markets... Exciting times are ahead,"" Branson told a London news briefing.
The Virgin empire, which spans everything from its airline, music and financial services to its own-label cola, already has a major rail business.
It is a partner in the London and Continental Railways (LCR) consortium which owns the Eurostar passenger service that links London with Paris and Brussels through the Channel Tunnel.
Will Whitehorn, director of Virgin Rail, told Reuters, ""Our key plan is to buy a new fleet, spending 250 million pounds ($419.7 million) on new rolling stock, agreed as part of the bid.""
The order will be placed next year, with the first deliveries due in 2002. Under financial terms, the government subsidy in the first year of the 15-year franchise will be 112.9 million pounds ($189.6 million).
That subsidy has been cut from the 1996/97 level of 127 million pounds ($213.2 million) and will average 36.4 million ($61.1 million) over the life of the franchise term.
Whitehorn said the subsidy will be eroded over the 15-year term and in the final year Virgin Rail will make a 10 million pound ($16.9 million) payment to the government.
Sir George Young, transport secretary said, ""This deal is final proof of the renaissance which is sweeping through Britain's railway industry... Virgin will take a loss-making nationalised company and transform it within 15 years into a profitable enterprise.""
Virgin will refurbish the company's HST 125 diesel trains and has pledged to increase train miles by 14 percent between May 1998 and 2002.
The services will be rebranded under the Virgin name and cover destinations across England, Scotland and Wales.
This is the first rail franchise to be awarded to Virgin Rail which also bid unsuccessfully for the Gatwick Express route.
But Virgin is on the shortlist for the West Coast rail franchise and has a bid in for the Thameslink service in London.
Of 25 rail franchises covering passenger services across Britain, the government has sold 14 to the private sector as part of its privatisation of the network.

Pretax profits for the period ended December 31 were 397 million pounds ($636.5 million), with total revenue up to 1.06 billion pounds versus 987 million pounds.
In the nine months 76.6 million passengers travelled through BAA's airports which also include Gatwick and Stansted in London.
Sir John Egan, chief executive, said the figures represented ""strong performance across the board"".
Airport and traffic charge revenue stood at 385 million pounds, up 5.5 percent. Retailing revenue was 475 million, up 10 percent resulting in net retail income of 331 million, up 11 percent and property income rose 8.4 percent to 168 million pounds.
The solid looking set of figures failed to spark the market. Shares were down seven pence at 525 pence per share.
""It was a steady result but nothing terribly exciting,"" one senior dealer said. ""The overall market is a bit weak this morning and the shares are just reflecting that weakness.""
Commenting on the outlook, Egan welcomed the greater certainty which followed the Civil Aviation Authority's publication of its regulatory review for the coming five years.
That review said there was no need for BAA to divest any of its aiports in the UK and recommended a price control of RPI (retail price index) minus three percent.
The price control applies to its airport service charges, but around half of BAA'c sales now come from the shopping malls installed inside its airports.
BAA is also moving overseas, submitting bids to run overseas airports.
In a separate development, BAA group finance director Russell Walls said it had decided to cut back its stake in a bid group to run three Australian airports.
""We are cutting our stake in agreement with our other partners. The bid had too high a foreign content,"" he said. But Walls denied there was any prompt from the Australian government to reduce its dominance in the consortium, which includes Australian fund managers.
Bids have been put in for airports in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. ($1=.6237 Pound)

6,"Britain's building sector has finally shaken off one of its nastiest ailments, with strong evidence that the long and painful decline in the domestic housing market is now over and sales are on the up again.
But celebrations failed to break out across the sector.
Housebuilders may be set to reap the rewards of the recovery, but some of the biggest companies in the building industry on Friday continued to suffer from other afflictions.
Building material giants like RMC Plc, Redland Plc and BPB saw their shares slide heavily on Friday due to continued problems in the key German market plus the pound's relentless rise against the mark and dollar which is eating into valuable export revenues.
RMC ended 36p lower at 903.5. Redland closed 5.5p weaker at 330, BPB 13p off 362.5p and Blue Circle 7.5p off at 368.
Optimistic reports of British housing starts at a seven-year high and earlier predictions of 1997 house price inflation of up to 10 percent were overshadowed by concerns about a continued deterioration in German GDP and higher unemployment.
For these big building materials firms, analysts say the impact of Germany -- accounting for up to 40 percent of profits -- far outweighs the small upside from the British house sector.
The second negative is the 10 percent appreciation in the pound against the mark over the last few months. Companies like Redland have already fired a warning signal on sterling's potential impact on profits.
UBS building analyst Simon Brown summed up the gloom: ""Only a tiny proportion of the building material sector's business is in the UK. As a total of construction output, UK housing was 14 percent in 1995.""
Looking at one of the biggest players in the sector, RMC, Brown said: ""Less than 20 percent of RMC's profit comes from the UK and an even smaller part from UK housing. So it is a tiny proportion of overall earnings.""
Downgrades have haunted companies exposed to Germany and the pound. But one player which has escaped the pessimism and is tipped as a ""buy"" in light of the housing recovery is Caradon.
Caradon is seen as the recovery stock, having slashed around 75 million pounds ($126 million) from costs in the last two years and rationalised its portfolio of businesses.
Its profits are seen rising sharply this year and next. It has sizeable exposure to the British housing market, through its double glazing window and shower product range. It can also cash in on demand for building material supplies from Britain.
""It has the highest proportion of output linked to UK housing,"" said UBS' analyst Brown. ""Hepworth and Marley could also be worth a play,"" he said.
Howard Seymour, an analyst at brokers BZW, said in a note that he recommended buying Tarmac and Redland -- but that building material firm BPB was classed a ""sell"".
""We argue that the sector is displaying late cycle characteristics as speculative supply is following demand which gives a robust profile to recovery over 1997.""
He said that expected rises in British interest rates this year would ""take a back seat to profit recovery. Accordingly, investors should view the UK as their first choice for building materials investment over the next 12 months.""
The main beneficiaries of the house market rebound will be housebuilder specialists. ""Those which were best at buying land will be the most serious winners - Berkeley, Persimmon, Barratt and Beazer,"" said Brown. ($1=.5950 Pound)

This is the first rail franchise to be awarded to Virgin Rail which also bid unsuccessfully for the Gatwick Express route which went to National Express buses.
But Virgin is on the shortlist for the West Coast rail franchise and has a bid in for the Thameslink service in London. There are 25 rail franchises in all, covering passenger services across Britain.
So far the government has sold 14 franchises to the private sector as part of its privatisation of the entire network.
The Virgin empire, which spans everything from its airline, music and financial services to its own-label cola, already has a major rail business.
It is a partner in the London and Continental Railways consortium which owns the Eurostar passenger service linking London with Paris and Brussels through the Channel Tunnel.
Service through the Channel Tunnel were suspended last week after a serious fire.
Whitehorn refused to comment on the financial impact of the closure of Eurotunnel's tunnel.
LCR has said that it needs to raise Eurostar's passenger traffic to fund construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link between the tunnel and London. ($1=.5956 Pound)

6,"Stagecoach Plc, the bus to rail operator which has seen its shareprice double in under a year, said on Thursday it expected ongoing progress in dividend growth after reporting record profits of 47 million stg.
Keith Cochrane, finance director, told Reuters ""We expect ongoing progress in our second half dividend,"" even after raising the interim payout by 43 percent to three pence. But he pointed out that the first dividend reflected the 15 million stg profit from the sale of its stake in Strathclyde Buses.

6,"Drugs giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc bought the remaining 50 percent of its Japanese joint venture Nippon Glaxo for 354 million pounds ($596 million) on Thursday in its quest for growth in the world's second biggest market.
Analysts in London said they had long expected the buy-out of Japanese partner Shin Nihon Jitsugyo Co Ltd, which will also get a 7.7 million pounds (1.38 billion) payout in lieu of the 1996 dividend.
Nippon Glaxo develops, produces and markets prescription medicines across Japan and has net assets of 30.7 billion yen ($275.3 million), as valued on June 30. Its post-tax profit for the six months to June 30 was 2.5 billion yen.
After setting up a series of Japanese joint ventures since the early 1980s, Glaxo has moved to take them over in a bid to carve a share in Japan's lucrative marketplace, second only to the U.S. in terms of profitability and sales to the group.
Seven percent of Glaxo Wellcome's profits stem from Japan, which represents 20 percent of the world market itself.
One London-based pharmaceuticals analyst said: ""The deal will be slightly earnings enhancing as it's financed by debt and Japanese interest rates are low at half a percent.""
The move to take over ventures in Japan would allow the group to accelerate growth plans by launching new products there, including its new respiratory treatments for asthma and the new herpes treatment Valtrex which replaces Zovirax.
Another analyst agreed that Japan offered a notable expansion opportunity, saying: ""It's obviously one of the leading growth markets for Glaxo.""
But shares in Glaxo showed little response, falling a modest 3.5 pence to 950 in London.
Under the deal, Hiroshi Konishi, president of Nippon Glaxo, and Akira Konishi, vice-president and general manager, will give up these positions but remain members of Nippon Glaxo's board, Glaxo Wellcome said.
Nippon Glaxo had net assets at June 30 of 30.7 billion yen, or 180 million pounds. Its profits after tax for the six months ended June 30 were 2.5 billion yen.

46,"China's central bank chief has said that inflation would be a modest seven percent this year and this showed the state's economic policies were working.
But Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, lashed out at companies that had taken advantage of tight money policies used to tackle inflation by lending money at excessively high rates.
""The appropriately tight monetary polices have achieved clear results which have been acknowledged both in China and abroad,"" Dai was quoted as saying in the Financial News on Monday.
""We can now control inflation to about seven percent for the full year,"" he said.
China's retail inflation stood at 6.9 percent year-on-year in the first seven months and at 5.9 percent in July alone.
Beijing has said it wanted to keep inflation within 10 percent for 1996, down from 14.8 percent last year and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
But the central bank chief had harsh words for companies that had taken advantage of the tough austerity programme put in place three years ago to deal with the worst days of inflation.
He did not name any of the offenders but he said that some ""monopoly groups"" and publicly listed companies were lending out money at excessively high rates.
Tsingtao Brewery, which has stock listed in Hong Kong as well as in Shanghai, has run afoul of regulatory authorities in the British colony in the past for lending out funds raised from its public offer.
A senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named said several big ministries were cash-rich and able to earn more than bank deposit rates by lending out their funds.
""The big offenders are some cash-rich ministries,"" said the economist. ""They can earn 16-18 percent on their money.""
That would compare with interest of 7.47 percent earned on one-year bank deposits.
Other economists have said that higher rates were available for even more speculative lending.
Dai gave no indication of whether any measures were being planned to address these problems, although he said that funds in the banking system were unevenly distributed.
He said that China had already taken steps to curb illegal money market trade and that it had taken steps to ensure that other unauthorised financial organisations did not act as commercial banks.
""There are many violations of financial regulations,"" Dai was quoted as saying. ""There must be an expansion of supervision over the financial sector.""

46,"Russia will push to expand economic ties with China at a top level meeting in Moscow next month as old political hostilities fade in the background, a senior Russian diplomat said on Friday.
""The big task in bilateral relations is to boost economic cooperation to the level of political cooperation,"" said Russian Ambassador Igor Rogachev.
Chinese Premier Li Peng and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will meet in Moscow to map out practical economic steps in a relationship described by the two sides as a strategic partnership.
The two former rivals for the leadership of the world communist movement have not seen such smooth relations since 1949 -- when the Chinese communists proclaimed the birth of the People's Republic of China, according to the Russian diplomat.
""Relations have never been on such a healthy and rational basis,"" said Rogachev, one of Russia's top China experts.
The two sides would now push to deliver oil, natural gas and electricity from Siberia to China while Russia wanted a role in China's nuclear power development, he told reporters.
Rogachev said Russia was hoping to see other neighbouring countries participate in the projects, though he gave no indication of how likely that was or what form it might take.
China and Russia have already proposed an oil and natural gas pipeline linking Siberia to China but financing is certain to be a key hurdle for the huge project.
""I don't expect an agreement on these issues at the (December) meeting but perhaps we'll be ready by the spring,"" he said.
That is when China's President Jiang Zemin travels to Moscow for a summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a meeting arranged during the visit to China this week of Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
China and Russia are expected to sign another accord soon, this one on troop reductions along their 4,300 km (2,580 mile) border, the official Xinhua news agency has said.
Rogachev said Russia was eager to reduce the high cost of stationing troops along the lengthy border, particularly when the strains of the 1960s Sino-Soviet split were so far behind them.
""We don't think that China creates a threat for our country and they (China's leaders) don't see Russia as an enemy,"" Rogachev said.
During Yeltsin's April visit to China the two nations -- along with the three former soviet states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan -- signed a treaty agreeing to inform each other of military exercises along the border and not to attack each other.
However, China and Russia been unable to reach agreement on one area of cooperation -- further deliveries of Russia's Sukhoi Su-27 interceptors.
China's armed forces have already put into service a first group of the planes but talks for further sales have long been stalled over payment and technology transfer issues.
""Talks are going on,"" Rogachev told reporters. ""There will be more talks in future.""

46,"The CITIC Industrial Bank, financial arm of China's CITIC conglomerate, said on Monday it expected solid profit growth this year despite mounting competition and a key goal of limiting risk.
""Stable development is more important than a big profit rise,"" said Zhang Jian, deputy general manager and economist.
The bank has set a target of pre-tax profits of at least 1.8 billion yuan ($217 million) this year compared with 1.58 billion in 1996 and 1.01 billion in 1995.
The bank is a major profit contributor to the China International Trust and Development Corp, or CITIC, which has interests from telecommunications to real estate and manufacturing. The CITIC group announced overall earnings of 2.478 billion yuan last year.
China's economic tsar Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has pushed for more discipline in the financial sector, particularly following the failure in January of the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp. That sent shock waves through the financial community, and Zhu has warned that state banks overall need to cut bad debt by two percent annually over the next five years.
CITIC Industrial Bank has been one of the stronger players in the financial sector, however.
Unlike the main state-run commercial banks, it does not have to make loans to aid government policy, regardless of whether the borrower can repay.
But Zhang said top management at the bank was focusing on tightening risk controls.
""Enhancing (asset) quality and the assessment of risk"" were two key goals for the bank this year, he said in an interview.
CITIC's customers for the most part were profitable state industrial companies and government corporations engaged in foreign trade. Most of the bank's loans were short term, usually for less than 180 days, Zhang said.
That has made it difficult for the bank to move into new areas of business such as home mortgages or car financing, two areas where China is likely to see substantial growth in the years ahead.
CITIC is also facing an increasingly crowded banking sector as new domestic banks emerge and more foreign banks enter the local market.
Zhang said CITIC had begun private banking operations at its branch in the southern city of Guangzhou to try to expand business.
It is experimenting with ways to boost service to its big corporate clients, such as extending banking hours and installing computers at customer offices and linking them to its own network to make banking easier.
CITIC had total assets of 108 billion yuan at the end of last year compared with 86 billion at the end of 1995.
Deposits reached 87 billion yuan last year, up from 67 billion in 1995, despite two reductions in domestic interest rates by the central bank last year.
Zhang said he believed further cuts in interest rates would make it difficult for the nation's banks to attract deposits.
""I don't think there can be another interest rate cut this year,"" he said. ""If you want investment, you need savings to support it.""

46,"China is preparing a lobbying campaign to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at the ministerial meeting in Singapore this month, officials said.
It will send a team led by Long Yongtu, assistant minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and an experienced trade negotiator, to the meetings that begin next Monday, Chinese officials said.
China, which will be an observer at the meetings, has waged a lengthy battle to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor body governing global trade, the WTO.
It has pushed to gain entry on the favourable terms of a developing nation but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy was too big for such preferential treatment.
""We will be there as an observer,"" said a Chinese trade official of the Singapore meeting. ""That is all we will be doing.""
BEIJING TO PRESS CASE
But foreign diplomats said China would continue to press its case, mainly outside the official meetings in bilateral talks with member countries.
""The real work will be in the corridors around the meeting,"" said a diplomat who monitors international trade issues.
""China wants support from as many countries as possible to put pressure on the United States,"" said another diplomat.
China views gaining entry to the WTO as a symbol of its growing prestige but it also is eyeing the benefits of fixed mechanisms for settling trade disputes.
Beijing has had numerous trade spats with its major trading partners -- from annual review by the United States of its Most Favoured Nation status to copyright protection for textiles and shoes.
By joining the global trade body, China could ensure that any penalties imposed on it conformed with WTO dispute settlement procedures. Diplomats said that could be of considerable value to Beijing as mounting exports increase the prospect of trade disputes.
Western diplomats familiar with the trade issue described China's current position on WTO as ""woefully inadequate"".
MOVING TOWARD COMPROMISE
But diplomats said Beijing was aware that it must put more on the table and there appeared to be some movement toward a compromise.
China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines that China expected to conclude talks with the United States on WTO in the first half of next year.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has also offered to aim for an average 15 percent import duty by the year 2000 compared with 23 percent now.
More important to the United States is ensuring access to the big Chinese domestic market and the removal of a whole range of practices that are seen as discriminating against foreign firms.
Washington would like to see an end to unpublished restrictions on purchases of foreign made goods, changes in agricultural import practices and more relaxed requirements on producing components in China.
China says these restrictions are needed to protect infant domestic industries that are unable to compete with established foreign companies.

46,"China gave U.S. President Bill Clinton a signal on Sunday that the election had not cleared away nagging trade disputes, saying it planned tit-for-tat curbs on American imports.
Beijing said it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.
The announcement came only days after Clinton's re-election triumph and ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Sino-U.S. relations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.
China and the U.S. have said they saw an improvement in relations since the two sides narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival, Taiwan, earlier this year.
Beijing said last week that it saw Clinton's re-election as a good opportunity for better ties in a ""somewhat improved atmosphere"".
The temporary import ban, which would take effect on December 10, was in retaliation for what China called severe violations by the U.S. of a bilateral textile accord.
""The decision was made in response to the U.S. unilateral cut of import quotas of Chinese textiles, which severely violated the bilateral textile agreement,"" the official Xinhua news agency said.
In September, Washington announced punitive charges against 1996 import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using transshipments to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.
The action -- which was expected to cost China about $19 million -- marked the first time Washington had imposed so-called triple charges against repeated violations of a bilateral textile accord.
The U.S. move was made without full consultation and clear supporting evidence, Xinhua said.
Beijing accused Washington of imposing a series of barriers that had seriously affected Chinese textile export to the U.S. as well as China's ability to pay for American imports.
China said it had urged the U.S. to withdraw the penalties but its pleas had been ignored, leaving it no choice but to take action.
China's import suspension would also apply to U.S. fruits and animal husbandry products, though there was no indication of which specific items would be barred within the broad product categories.
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the General Administration of Customs would have a detailed list ready before December 10, according to Xinhua.
China also said it opposed any attempt to impose the will of one side upon others in trade matters, and called on the U.S. to avoid such measures in future.
""Once again, we wish to urge the United States to handle trade disputes in the spirit of advancing bilateral trade, and refrain from taking any actions harmful to bilateral trade in the future,"" it said.

46,"The Australian stock exchange on Tuesday used the China visit of Prime Minister John Howard to make a high profile sales pitch for Chinese companies to list shares on Australia's stock market.
The Australian prime minister, before meeting China's President Jiang Zemin, found time to open a seminar for China's market regulators and top-level managers of its state-run companies designed to show them why they should look to Australia to raise capital.
Senior officials from the Australian Stock Exchange as well as brokerages and legal firms delivered the message that Australia had much to offer.
""Cross-border equities trading now amounts to around $4 trillion a year, which no stock market can afford to ignore,"" Australian Stock Exchange chairman Maurice Newman told the seminar.
""I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market.""
Most Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks.
One recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed, and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest.
Newman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection. These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing, in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country.
Trading in some of those issues has not been active.
""The liquidity of those companies is mixed,"" said Newman. ""As a group we would prefer that it were greater.""
Australia may soon get its first direct Chinese listing.
Taihang Cement, a cement producer based in the northern province of Hebei, has already gained approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a foreign listing.
Company officials told reporters they hoped to list their shares in Australia by the year-end.
""We chose Australia because we have a foundation there,"" said Zhang Zhixian, Taihang's manager of investment development, noting that the company exports cement to Australia.
Company officials said the exact size of the offer had not been set but would range between 100 and 200 million yuan ($12-24 million).
Other participants at the seminar said Australia might target its efforts at sectors where Australia is already strong, such as in natural resources.
""Australia would have a natural advantage in infrastructure and resource-based companies,"" said Tony Greenwood, of law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, noting the heavy weighting of such stocks in Australia.
One area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency, which has posed a problem for them in the past.
Some Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency.
""Our concern must also be the integrity of our market,"" said Newman.
""It is important that companies are familiar with our listing requirements and they observe them faithfully.""

46,"China has assembled a virtual ""who's who"" of its Communist leaders to arrange Deng Xiaoping's funeral next week in what analysts described as a show of unity for his chosen successor.
Diplomats in the capital also said the 459-member group would draw a veil over the Communist Party's internal politics ahead of a key party congress where decisions on top jobs and future policies would be made later this year.
""This is obviously too big a group to make funeral arrangements,"" said a Western diplomat on Friday. ""Not everyone will be making decisions.""
Deng died on Wednesday aged 92. China will hold the funeral for its paramount leader next Tuesday in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
The ceremonies -- unlike those for revolutionary leader Mao Zedong in 1976 -- will not include a lying in state with a mourning public allowed to file past.
In accordance with his wishes, Deng's body parts will be donated to science and his ashes will be scattered at sea.
Deng's anointed successor, Commmunist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin, is chairman of the funeral committee that includes all members of the 18-man Politburo and veterans of the communist revolution such as former president Yang Shangkun, 89, and ex-parliament chairman Peng Zhen, 95.
The list also includes Hua Guofeng, Mao's chosen successor until he was toppled by Deng.
""It is meant to be a sign of great unity and stability,"" said another foreign envoy.
Diplomats said the inclusion of the elder statesmen in the group aimed to lend legitimacy to the current leadership, providing a link to the party's revolutionary roots.
""This gives them some continuity with the first generation of the leadership,"" said a European diplomat.
But it also helps conceal the inner workings of the party as key figures jockey for position before the 15th party congress.
Broad decisions on political and economic strategy are likely to be taken at the meeting, held every five years.
Political analysts said the creation of a smaller group to direct the funeral arrangements might give too much information to the public which is normally kept at a safe distance from the party's internal workings.
The tighter the group, the easier to identify the main players, they said.
""They (party leaders) don't want to reveal too much before the congress,"" said the European diplomat.

46,"Farmers near Beijing marked the death of Deng Xiaoping quietly on Thursday, putting the hard task of making a living above memorials for the man whose reforms raised rural incomes dramatically.
Some people in this rural county in municipal Beijing offered a private word of thanks to China's paramount leader, who helped steer the nation on a pragmatic course until his death at the age of 92 on Wednesday.
Some shrugged and said they were more concerned with putting food on the family table, while others said they had not even heard the news.
""Is it true?"" asked one young man as he unloaded coal from a truck, heaping it beside a small hotel run by farmers who could no longer find work on the land.
""I hadn't heard this. It's a great loss for the nation of course, but for me the main concern is making a living,"" he said.
Chinese state media announced Deng's death to the nation early on Thursday.
Deng, who told his countrymen that to get rich was glorious, may not have made every farmer wealthy but his policies have clearly made life easier for most.
""We owe him a debt of gratitude,"" said Shi Huaiqing as he leaned against a tree beside a frozen fishpond and watched his flock graze in a pastoral scene topped by a distant view of the Great Wall.
""My life is much better than it was years ago,"" said the 45-year-old, who thanks to policies introduced by Deng can now raise and sell his sheep privately without being branded a traitor to communism.
""Before I couldn't sell these sheep on my own,"" he said. ""Now I earn a good living.""
Down the road from this village, a 70 year-old retired farmer surnamed Zhao echoed those sentiments.
""We are much better off than before,"" he said, smiling a toothless grin as he sifted through a road-side rubbish dump looking for scrap plastic.
""In the old days we all ate together and worked together in the production brigades. None of us had any money but now I have enough to get by with a little help from my sons,"" he said.
The one-time farmer said that in the 1950s Deng had visited a village not far from where he was standing and had expressed his disgust at the harsh conditions of rural life at that time.
""He at least was concerned with our welfare,"" said Zhao.
But some people said they were disappointed that incomes had not grown faster and expressed disdain for a surge in corruption unleashed by Deng's economic reforms.
""Deng may have been concerned for our welfare, but many local officials still exploit us,"" said a farmer named Du as he sold fruit at a roadside stall near an apple orchard he tended.
""The police always come along and chase us away and sometimes throw my apples on the ground,"" Du said.
""I may be better off now than I was but it is still hard to make a living,"" he said. ""We still have a long way to go.""

46,"China trumpeted the 100-day mark for the recovery of Hong Kong on Sunday and hailed late leader Deng Xiaoping for his guiding role in bringing more than a century of colonial shame to a close.
Hundreds of people gathered at midnight near Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing to watch a huge electronic countdown clock as it flashed only 100 days to go before the British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1.
Official newspapers covered their front pages with reports of the impending end of British colonial rule as called for under a Sino-British accord signed in 1984.
""We have endured 100 years of shame, 100 years of resistance and 100 years of waiting,"" said the Guangming Daily.
""Now in another 100 days, the hopes of generations will be realised.""
The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, devoted much of its front page to the historic occasion and the role played in it by the nation's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who died last month aged 92 before he could see his dream fulfilled.
Deng guided China's negotiations with Britain and is credited with devising the formula of ""one country, two systems"" that allows Hong Kong to keep its capitalist system and a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years.
""At this moment we think even more fondly of Deng Xiaoping,"" said the party newspaper.
""It was he who proposed the great formula of 'one country, two systems' that allowed us to peacefully resolve a thorny question left over from history and realise the complete reunification of our country...""
That praise was echoed by some of the hundreds of people who braved Beijing's chilly night air to watch the countdown clock mark the last 100 days before the transfer of power in Hong Kong.
""This is Deng's contribution,"" said a retired office worker surnamed Chang. ""I am overjoyed.""
A huge roar erupted from the crowd at midnight as students waved banners saying, ""China takes the road to strength"" and chanted ""Hong Kong comes home"".
""I'm thrilled,"" said An Na, a student at the Chemical Industry Institute. ""I wish I didn't have to wait 100 days.""
China ceded Hong Kong island to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanjing following the Opium War, and Britain later added to its holdings in the area.
While China hailed the impending recovery of Hong Kong, it had barely a passing word for the British government that decided to hand back the colony peacefully rather than contest its claim to the territory.
The official media also had little to say about China's pledges of a ""high degree of autonomy"" under the joint accord, though it hinted at concerns in Hong Kong and elsewhere.
The Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, published in the border boom town of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, tried to reassure residents of Hong Kong about a report on the Chinese army garrison that will be stationed in the territory.
""Don't worry, dear compatriots,"" it advised its readers, without saying what they might have to worry about.
The People's Daily similarly sought to deflect concerns.
""More and more people are coming to the belief that the Chinese government is reliable and capable and will faithfully carry out its promises,"" it said.

46,"China marked on Saturday the first ""tombsweeping"" day since the death of Deng Xiaoping with few outward signs of remembrance for the late paramount leader.
Thousands of Beijing residents streamed through the gates of Babaoshan cemetery for the Qingming festival, traditionally the day for tidying ancestral graves.
But for the most part this was a family occasion, far removed from the political limelight that surrounded Deng during his lifetime.
""I have come here every year since my husband died in 1991,"" said a Beijing resident, holding the hand of her granddaughter as they left the cemetery.
""This is a family matter. There is no connection with any political leaders.""
A group of students from Deng's native province of Sichuan, all of them enrolled at a university in the Chinese capital, gathered at the cemetery gates. They too had a private reason for being there.
""We are helping a friend sweep his father's grave,"" said one of the students.
Deng died on February 19 aged 92. He was cremated at Babaoshan and his ashes scattered at sea in accordance with his wishes.
That has left the public with no specific place to honour the man who steered China away from the radical policies of Mao Zedong and onto the path of economic development, even if it meant adopting capitalist ways.
Those pragmatic policies raised living standards and turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.
Beijing's central Tiananmen Square has been one such place to honour the nation's fallen heroes but public displays of respect were not encouraged on this day.
Early on Saturday, as a group of secondary students walked towards the shrine to martyrs of the revolution at the centre of the square, they were quickly approached by security men.
After a brief discussion, they were allowed to bow and then told to leave, witnesses said.
China's communist leaders have traditionally planted trees on the Qingming festival and that was how the official media chose to remember Deng.
The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, showed photographs of Deng planting trees over the years since 1979, when he began his programme of reforms that changed China's political landscape.
""Now these trees have grown tall,"" said the newspaper.
In the spirit of Deng's reforms, vendors of silk flowers were doing brisk business outside the Babaoshan cemetery.
Visitors queued up to buy wreaths similar to those that adorned grave sites inside.
Deng was in the thoughts of other Beijing residents, such as Bai Lansheng, a sculptor who is working on a bronze statue of the late leader.
""We are getting ready to ship the plaster mould to Shanghai now,"" he said from his Beijing workshop. ""There it will be cast in bronze.""
In June the six-metre (20-foot) statue will be shipped to the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders the British colony of Hong Kong.
Deng directed negotiations that led to the 1984 Sino-British accord under which the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.
Deng died before the colony's recovery but his statue will gaze across the border and ""witness"" the historic event.

42,"Blue chip technology stocks charged ahead Wednesday in a new buying spree spurred on by optimism about holiday PC sales and year-end book-squaring by money managers, traders and market analysts said.
Market participants said the rally was spurred by positive comments from a Soundview analyst about Compaq Computer Corp, and waning fears that the holiday sales season would prove a failure for consumer personal-computer makers.
The enthusiasm swept up other PC makers such as Dell Computer Corp and spilled over to other top technology names.  
By late afternoon, Compaq had added 6-1/2 points on the day to 78-3/4 while International Business Machines Corp gained 6-1/8 to 157-3/4.
Leading Nasdaq's most actives was Intel Corp, which swelled 5-3/8 to 135-3/8, Dell, up 3-5/8 to 57 and Microsoft Corp, which gained 2-3/4 to 82-5/8.
""It looks like they're going after the group again,"" said one trader, pointing in particular to Compaq, Intel and IBM.
""They are just buying the techs in a dramatic way again,"" agreed another trader. ""The PC scare isn't what they thought it would be,"" he said.  
""It's a group move, if you look at other names, like Compaq up six, Intel up 5-1/8, Dell up 4-1/8,"" said Peter Jenkins, director of global equity trading at Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark, listing some of the most active names.
""We're coming to the end of the year,"" he said, ""and these are big (institutional) holdings.""
""IBM and Intel I think have sold here over last couple of weeks, and whatever had to be done has been done,"" he argued, laying the groundwork for institutional buyers to add to their holdings.
""All (these) stocks are in a year-end window-dressing rally,"" said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management, who concurred that several of these stocks had been oversold in the past two weeks.
""IBM is the one all the money managers want in their portfolios,"" Orlando said, referring to the desire to put the best face on their end-of-year report cards by which investors judge the relative performances of funds.
Earlier, Soundview PC analyst Mark Specker upgraded his short-term rating on Compaq to buy from hold and retained his long-term buy position on the stock.

42,"Intel Corp stock surged on Tuesday, lifted by a quarterly earnings report that substantially outpaced Wall Street expectations and confirmed its status among analysts as the shooting star of technology stocks.
The earnings report released Monday spurred gains in the stocks of personal computer makers who build machines based on Intel microprocessors but it did little to buoy other chip makers.
""The Intel report was clearly a positive for the whole PC industry,"" said veteran semiconductor analyst Dan Klesken of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
""It is an endorsement of our view that we are in for a strong upgrade cycle for the second half of the year,"" said Klesken.
Still, analysts said Intel stock gains were restrained by uncertainties over whether the third quarter's sharp rise in orders may have come at the expense of the fourth quarter.
The concern was magnified by Intel's decision to at least temporarily halt the practice of forecasting its business prospects.
Intel stock rose $3.50 to $111.125 Tuesday on Nasdaq in a volatile day of trading in which just under 20 million Intel shares changed hands. Intel's gains sparked the technology-heavy Nasdaq index to 1,258.10, up 1.74, its second consecutive record closing high.
On Monday Intel reported third-quarter profits of $1.3 billion, up from $931 million in 1995's third quarter. Wall Street had predicted profits of $1.1 billion.
Brokers responded to the results with a wave of higher earnings projections for Intel for 1996 and 1997.
Personal computer makers who rely on Intel micrprocessors also saw significant gains, as investors viewed Intel's order surge as confirmation of strong demand for the machines themselves.
Compaq Computer Corp. gained $2 to close at $74.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a day ahead of its own earnings report, due Wednesday.
Dell Computer Corp. rose $3.50 to $88.375 and Gateway 2000 Inc. climbed $3.375 to $56.75, both on Nasdaq.
But Intel's swelling fortunes were seen as having only limited effect on other semiconductor suppliers.
Montgomery Securities analyst Clark Westmont said the main beneficiaries were a handful of custom PC chip makers who sell graphics controllers and other PC-related devices.
Every Intel processor that goes into a PC is accompanied by serveral such ancillary chips.
""Intel is the locomotive who drags along all the other guys in this food chain,"" Westmont said. ""As a result, these other guys are enjoying higher recognition today.""
He pointed in particular to PC graphics component supplier Chips and Technologies Inc. stock, which jumped $4.875 to $19.75, or roughly 25 percent, after it released its own strong quarterly earnings report.

42,"Computer, give me $20 bucks.
Such a demand enters the realm of possibility with the introduction Monday of a device that turns a personal computer into an automated-teller machine capable of dispensing card-based electronic cash, marking a new step in PC-based home banking.
Fischer International Systems Corp said its $60 device can be inserted into the floppy disk drive of any PC, enabling it to read ""smart cards,"" a new type of plastic credit-card that can perform electronic cash transactions and store bank account balances.  
Already gaining popularity in Europe to pay for store purchases and streetside telephone calls, the ""smart card"" is beginning to take hold in the United States as a replacement for cash used in ordinary purchases like grocery shopping.
By enabling PCs to securely dispense money, the device may provide a major stimulus to home banking by empowering consumers to perform financial transactions that now require a visit to a bank branch or an automated teller machine.
""What's been missing is a low-cost, easy-to-use 'bridge' between smart cards and personal computers,"" Fischer President and Chief Executive Michael Battaglia said.  
Smarty, as the product is known, is a slim piece of hardware that inserts into a personal computer's 3.5 inch floppy disk reader, allowing the machine to link via the Internet to banks or retail outlets.
The product is unique because Fischer holds key patents for smart card readers inserted into 3.5 inch floppy drives -- making Smarty the most readily adaptable card reader for the 200 million personal computers now in use, company officials said.  
The device, which can be inserted into home or office personal computers or into a laptop computer when traveling, will enable consumers to make wider use of banking cards for purchases, replacing the need to carry loose bills and coins.
As such, the product could be a boon to PC-based home banking, permitting full-scale transactions instead of the more limited functions now available, like electronic balancing of checkbooks, financial investment tracking or tax return filing.  
Fischer officials said they are working with several major U.S. and European financial services firms to spur use of the devices in a variety of business and consumer applications, including home banking over the Internet.
In addition, Art Burton, Fischer's vice president of sales and marketing said the company is in talks with top providers of home banking software like Intuit Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to link Smarty to their software.
""We have had some discussions at various stages with the primary providers of home banking software,"" Burton said. ""We are also working with individual banks.""  
Burton said the PC-based Smarty product will be offered later this year to consumers participating in a trial of smart card technology on the Upper West Side of New York City by a group led by MasterCard, Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank.
In addition, Fischer said it has received initial Smarty orders from the Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, for pilot testing by bank employees.
Orders for demonstration models have also come from the U.S.-based credit card consortium Visa, U.K.-based Mondex International and Sweden's Telia Group.  
Smart cards contain an embedded microchip capable of storing more than four million bytes of computer data, or dozens of pages of information -- far more than existing magnetic-strip credit cards that hold just 40 characters or so.
The new financial data format can act as a one-stop shopping card storing electronic cash, a collection of credit cards, and other personal information including several forms of identification to prevent fraud.  
While slow to catch on in the United States, smart cards have grown popular in Europe and Asia, where millions are now used by banks and credit card concerns as a means of storing digital cash, by phone companies as long-distance calling cards, or in healthcare to carry details of an individual's medical history.
Fischer, with annual revenues of about $20 million, is solely owned by Addison Fischer, its chairman and a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  
Addison Fischer is considered one of the world's leading experts on computer security. He was one of the founders and principal owners of RSA Data Security Inc, developers of a popular computer security encryption technique.
Fischer and his two partners recently sold RSA to publicly-held Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. in return for $200 million in Security Dynamics stock.  
Fischer faces many larger competitors in the smart card reader market, including France's Gemplus, U.S.-based Schlumberger Ltd and VeriFone Inc ;, Germany' Siemens AG and Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands.
But these rival machines take the form of bulky computer attachments or standalone-terminals priced between $80 and $300.
By contrast, Fischer's floppy-insert method will be priced at $60 initially, with prices expected to fall below $40 as volumes increase in the coming year, making it an affordable option for consumers, Burton said.
Asked if the company may be considering an initial public stock offering, Burton said that, ""It is firmly in our plans, but we are talking long-term -- within the next year -- not short-range.""
He said Fischer plans to make another major product announcement in the spring of a related computer security technology before it decides whether to move ahead with any possible sale of the company's shares to the public.

42,"MCI Communications Corp. Thursday reported flat quarterly earnings despite a healthy rise in revenues, and the company warned that growth might slow as it embraces higher profit margin businesses.
The telecommunications company earned $295 million, or 42 cents a share, in the first quarter, unchanged from a year ago and in line with analysts' consensus estimates. Revenues grew 8.7 percent to $4.9 billion from $4.1 billion.
""MCI continues to demonstrate strong overall revenue growth and profits,"" said Gerald Taylor, chief executive. ""As we move towards our merger with BT, MCI is focused on implementing long term strategies that position us for growth.""
In October, MCI and British Telecom announced a merger valued at $23 billion that would create the world's second-largest telecommunications group. The deal is expected to close in the fall, subject to regulatory approval.
Long-distance revenues rose 8.2 percent to $4.4 billion from $4.1 billion, twice the pace of MCI's key long distance rivals, it said. Operating income was $653 million, a rise of $39 million, or 6.4 percent from last year's first quarter.
Traffic grew 4 percent from the 1996 first quarter.
MCI said, however, that it expected revenue and traffic growth rates to slow in coming quarters as the industry's growth in home phone markets moderates and as MCI invests more money in higher profit margin businesses.
Washington-based MCI said it was shifting away from selling access to its network at wholesale prices to other telephone companies, and tightening credit collection among the companies to which it sells network access.
In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine said MCI's strategy of replacing discount-seeking residential callers with customers willing to pay for value-added services should insulate it from the industry-wide slowdown.
MCI's strategy echoes concerns by rival AT&amp;T Corp., which described in its own first-quarter report Monday competitive pressures and a variety of costly ways to keep customers.
Until remaining barriers to entering the local services market drop, Maine said MCI will avoid chasing low-end consumers with AT&amp;T's practice of writing them checks.
Bear Stearns analyst Bette Massick said MCI appeared to be making progress in reducing the number of customers who switch to whichever provider offers the cheapest calling plan.
In both the business and mass markets, MCI said it is benefiting from efforts to offer integrated voice and data services on one bill under its networkMCI One and MCI One brands.
MCI's Business Markets posted double-digit revenue growth, led by especially strong growth in value-added services such as data, Internet, conferencing and pre-paid calling cards.
Business services account for about two-thirds of the company's overall revenues.
MCI's Information Technology revenues grew 27 percent to $433 million, with U.S. revenue doubling year-over-year. MCI said revenue from its Internet services has grown nearly 200 percent over first quarter 1996.
Local services revenue grew to $65 million or 63 percent year-over-year and jumped 33 percent from fourth quarter 1996, it said. MCI's stock fell $1.375 to $37.375 on Nasdaq.

42,"Faced with market share battles on several fronts, Novell Inc provided the outlines of a five-year game-plan that would reduce dependence on its mainstay network operating system business and diversify its revenue base into faster-growing software businesses.
In a speech to an investor conference here, Joseph Marengi, recently named president and chief operating officer, also said his company is contemplating the judicious use of its $1 billion in cash to make selective technology acquisitions.  
In response to a question, the executive downplayed persistent rumors that it is an acquisition target by saying that Novell's strategy remains focused on building its business as a ""standalone"" company.
""This is a company with a market cap of $4 billion, $1 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in revenues,"" he said. ""Everything we are doing is to position ourselves to be standalone.
He declined to comment on financial results of Novell's quarter ended in January, noting that it was in a quiet period ahead of the report due out next week.  
""Business is okay,"" he noted in passing.
Marengi said that as part of its plan to diversify its revenue base over the next five years, the company expected its core NetWare operating systems business to decline to 40 percent of total revenues from its current 60 percent position.
He said that by 2002, the company expected 25 percent of revenues from what he called ""platform-independent"" or non-NetWare server products and 25 percent from network applications software such as its group communications, systems management and Internet-related software products.  
Novell's strategy is to move beyond its historic dominance of the client/server-based local area network market and into the emerging future in which personal computers connect to the wider Internet without regard to whether the connection is local or on the other side of the globe, he said.
""We are trying to get people to think about client/network computing as opposed to client/server,"" Marengi said in response to a reporter's question.
By later this year, he said Novell expected to displace Microsoft Corp's Exchange product as the number two electronic messaging product in the world.  
He allowed that International Business Machines Corp's cc:Mail product would continue as the best-selling messaging product in the coming year.
In the near-term, Marengi said he believes Novell will successfully defend its position as the market leader among network operating systems, fending off a growing challenge from Microsoft's Windows NT.
While acknowledging that Windows NT was gaining ground as the core operating system used to manage corporate networks, he said this was mostly concentrated at the low-end of the market among smaller and newer businesses.  
He said Novell NetWare continues to dominate in larger corporate departmental networks, and estimated that only 2 percent of current NetWare customers had switched to alternative network operating systems such as Windows NT. NT's success had come among new users, he said, and noted that the company is re-doubling its efforts to target such emerging markets.
""We want to grow through acquisitions,"" Marengi said of the company's plan to once again consider acquisitions to fill technology gaps in its product line. ""We will make sure that any company we do acquire will fit (our overall) strategy,"" he said. ""Nothing on the scale of WordPerfect,"" he said.  
Novell sold WordPerfect Corp to Canada's Corel Corp at a substantial loss last year.
Marengi said he expected the company to double its installed base of server software units to 8 million units in 2000 from 4 million units currently, as part of a plan to put its server software count at over 10 million units five years out.
Server software are products used to manage the operations of centralized computers that manage traffic on local area networks that typically tie together numerous personal computers.
NetWare is used to connect local area networks that include 60 million desktop computers worldwide.  
He said Novell expects international revenues to contribute 60 percent of revenues five years out, up from 49 percent currently. As an example, he said Novell intends to capitalize on its leading position as ""The networking company in China.""
The executive said the company's operating profit margins have been hovering in the 20 to 23 percent range recently, and that those percentages will ""be up a little bit"" by the end of calendar 1997, "" but ""not significantly.""
He said the company's search for a new chief executive was on track and that he expected an appointment to be announced within 30 to 60 days.
He said Novell did not plan to use any of its $1 billion cash hoard to buy back stock.

42,"Seeking to show its readiness to compete in high-speed networking, Bay Networks Inc on Tuesday unveiled a set of products and strategies aimed at shoring up its reputation as a technology leader and helping it recover from the stumbles of recent years.
David House, Bay's recently hired chairman and chief executive, outlined the company's new ""Adaptive Networking"" strategy for making the plumbing of Internet-based networks easier to upgrade to the higher-speed networks now emerging.  
""Everybody's goal is networks that are invisible to the user,"" House said during a Las Vegas press conference at Networld+Interop, the semiannual trade show of the Internet equipment industry.
""We want networks that behave like electricity and water,"" House said, comparing computer networks to other well-developed infrastructures.
""Adaptive Networks are the products and technologies that will transition us to the Internet-optimized networks of tomorrow,"" he said.  
His appearance came exactly six months after House joined Bay Networks from Intel Corp, where he served as a respected senior executive for more than two decades.
Highlighting the company's new product announcements was a new single, application-specific networking chip capable of carrying up to 1.5 million packets of Internet data a second --- allowing networks to carry billions of bits of data per second.
The company said the new Route Switch Processor (RSP) integrates the manageability of routers with the speed of switches -- two traditionally separate product categories.  
House said the RSP chip, now running in Bay laboratories, would be offered in new routing switch products due out in 1998.
The RSP chip is designed to solve the growing demand for high-speed Internet transmission, while reducing technical bottlenecks that cause congestion on overloaded data networks.
House said RSP would serve as the core technology in its main product lines, including local networks used in corporate offices and in products serving telephone and Internet carriers.  
He said the chip would allow Bay to cut switch product prices tenfold over time, driving the cost of advanced switching down to $500 per connection from $5,000 currently.
Sounding like the old chip revolution evangelist he is, House described what he said were the semiconductor-driven dynamics of the networking business, which is seeing benefits from both exponential jumps in the power of computer chip technology and commodity-style price cuts.

42,"Acknowledging its failure to attract U.S. consumers, CompuServe Corp said it would disband its family-oriented Wow! online service and plans to defend its business and technical customer base.
The world's second-largest online service also said it would accelerate the way it expenses customer marketing costs and that it was taking a $28.6 million charge in the latest quarter for previously incurred subscriber acquisition costs.
Instead, it said it would pursue higher margin businesses, including international consumer markets, such as Europe.  
""For CompuServe, this represents a strategic retreat back to its basics,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, a veteran analyst of the online industry at Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.
""CompuServe will never contend for the King's mantle among the online service/Internet service providers in North America again,"" he declared.
CompuServe stock fell 1-5/8, to 10-1/8, in early trading. H&amp;R Block Inc, which several months ago suspended plans to spin off its remaining 80 percent stake in CompuServe to shareholders, fell 1-1/2, to 26-7/8.  
Earlier today, H&amp;R had reported a substantial loss for its quarter ended October 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil, and said it planned to go ahead with a cut in its quarterly dividend payment to $0.20 per share from $0.32 previously.
In its own report, CompuServe said it lost $0.63 per share for the second quarter ended in October, after charges for exiting the Wow! business and other accounting changes. This compared to a $0.19 a share profit in the year-ago quarter.
Disbanding Wow! resulted in an after-tax charge of $4.9 million, or $0.06 a share, and amortization of prior marketing costs led to the charge of $28.6 million, or $0.31 a share.  
""CompuServe's core users have always appreciated that service most for its independent forums and bulletin boards. They don't have any other place in cyberspace to get those services,"" Krasilovsky said.
CompuServe officials stressed that no new layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total headcount stands at about 3,200 worldwide.
In a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway maintained that while his company was abandoning further mass marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, ""If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.""  
Nontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would focus its efforts and investments going forward on business and professional markets, its traditional selling point.
Besides defending its core online services customer base, they said CompuServe will focus on other profitable operations like its network systems infrastructure unit, which generates 30 percent of total revenues.
In disbanding its Wow! service, the company blamed new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.
The company announced plans to launch early next year a new ""CompuServe for Business"" serivce, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new software interface and added content from ""thousands"" of information providers.  
Despite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas, where CompuServe's brand is the best recognized name among online and Internet access providers.
Conway said CompuServe Interactive's service has nearly doubled in its number of subscribers in Europe during the past 12 months, rising to more than 800,000 from about 450,000. ""It's a growing market for these services, and we outpaced the market,"" he said.
About 60 percent of CompuServe's European customers are for business, professional and technical users, while 40 percent fall in the consumer category, Conway said.
That's roughly the inverse of North America, where about 55 percent of CompuServe's main service are consumers.
The 800,000 customers represent the bulk of CompuServe's international base, which totaled 1.12 million at October 31.
The Wow! service had been introduced only seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground.
CompuServe Vice President Scott Kaufman, the man in charge of developing the Wow! service, promised at the time Wow! was lauched to carpet bomb consumers with free software disks promoting the new service.
""They'll be falling out of cereal boxes,"" he had vowed at the time.

42,"Microsoft Corp. and Fore Systems Inc. plan to annouce Tuesday a deal in which Microsoft will license Fore's high-speed networking technology for use in future versions of its Windows operating system software, according to sources familiar with the deal.
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is an emerging technology on which a new generation of higher speed networks are being built that are better able to handle voice, video and data simultaneously.
The sources said the deal will integrate Fore's ATM emulation software directly into the Windows operating system, allowing desktop office computers to use ATM technology without changing other existing computer software.
As a result, the deal could open up a potential market of millions of PC users to adopt ATM network technology, while ensuring compatability with older network technologies.
Neither Microsoft nor Fore Systems would confirm the deal.
But industry analysts said Microsoft's backing of ATM should boost the technology's legitimacy with corporate network administrators, who to date have proved reluctant to install higher-cost ATM networks in place of existing ones.
""It will make connecting PCs to ATM networks easier because all you will have to do is buy an ATM switch, buy an adapter card and a PC is up and running,"" said Mary Petrosky, a network analyst with The Burton Group in San Mateo, Calif., referring to the basic equipment necessary to install ATM.
Petrosky was one of a handful of analysts who were pre-briefed by the companies about outlines of the deal.
Existing technologies such as Ethernet and Token Ring have been around since the 1970s and remain the dominant standards for networks that connect corporate office computers.
ATM is considered more expensive because it requires investments in existing network infrastructure like cabling, switches and other equipment to be ripped out and replaced.
Sources said integration of ATM into Windows software will help standardize ATM networking products, making it easier to develop ATM products, while driving down customer costs.
Microsoft's own software business is likely to benefit from enabling networks able to transmit multimedia-rich information to become more widely available, Petrosky said.
To date, ATM backers, including Fore, the recognized industry leader in ATM technology development, have failed to win widespread adoption of it in corporate office networks.
Instead, Fore has built a fast-growing business selling ATM technology to telephone carriers who use it to transmit large volumes of data at high speeds over the backbone sections of their wide area telecommunciations networks.
Fore also sells adapter cards that can be installed inside personal computers that allow them to accept information transmitted over these wide area networks.
Here, it faces growing competition from Cisco Systems Inc, Cascade Communications Corp. and others.
Jeremy Duke, a network hardware analyst with the market research firm InStat, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said Microsoft's intergration of ATM would eliminate some of the hurdles of connecting ATM networks to desktop PCs.
However, he expected the deal's main impact would be to lend visibility to Fore's wide area network ATM business, by providing a broader base of PCs ready to communicate over networks using a mix of ATM and non-ATM technology.
""The deal puts ATM on a little bit more of an even-footing,"" Petrosky said, but noted, ""There are still cost issues and competing technology issues.""
Petrosky was referring to how ATM has been upstaged in corporate office networks by an intermediate class of technology known as Fast Ethernet, which allows networks using existing hardware to handle some multimedia communications.
In addition, she said the network industry was beginning to embrace a new method known as Gigabit Ethernet that could rival ATM capabalities in many repects. Gigabit Ethernet allows video transmission at speeds roughly similar to ATM.
""It's another thing that can help ATM, but I don't think it's going to drastically change the odds for ATM acceptance,"" Duke agreed. ""There are other cost-effective technologies available today,"" he said, referring to Fast Ethernet systems.
It was not clear from the sources whether Microsoft's plans extended beyond its Windows NT and Window 95 operating systems to include its older Windows 3.1 system.

32,"Magna Group Inc. has a definitive agreement to acquire Homeland Bankshares Corp., the second-largest banking company in Iowa, for about $216 million, the companies said Tuesday.
St. Louis-based Magna will issue 5 million shares of its common stock and pay $92 million in cash in exchange for all theoutstanding Homeland common shares. Homeland shareholders may choose to exchange each of their shares for either about 1.55 Magna shares, a comparable amount in cash or a combination.
Magna said it will repurchase about 600,000 shares of the stock, under its current repurchase plan.
""We certainly will consider buy back programmes beyond that, but nothing has been approved beyond that,"" G. Thomas Andes, Magna chairman, said in a news conference.
Waterloo, Iowa-based Homeland, with assets of $1.2 billion as of June 30, owns and operates four commercial banks and one savings bank and provides financial services through a network of 33 locations in Iowa.
Magna, with $5.35 billion in assets, is the third-largest banking institution in the St. Louis metropolitan area and the nation's 95th largest banking company. It has 106 banking locations throughout Illinois and Missouri and a trust and brokerage company.
After the acquisition, Magna would have about 55 percent of its assets in Illinois, 25 percent in Missouri and 20 percent in Iowa, Andes said.
The deal is subject to approval by Homeland shareholders and regulators.
Magna said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings within 12 months, and save about $8 million through centralization of systems and procedures.
Some of the cost savings will come from job cuts, though those cuts could come from attrition, Andes said.
Homeland Chief Executive Erl Schmiesing said during the news conference that cuts were underway at Homeland in any case as it consolidated.
Magna will continue to consider other acqusitions, possibly in Iowa, Andes said.
""We certainly like the state of Iowa,"" he said. ""We would certainly welcome the opportunity to expand in the state of Iowa, as well as Illinois and Missouri.""
Magna is also among several Missouri-based banks considered by analysts to be likely acquisition targets, a perception that did not change with the Homeland acquisition announcment.
""It certainly doesn't make them any less attractive or likely as a takeover candidate,"" said Steven Schroll, a banking industry analyst at Piper Jaffray.
Homeland's stock rose $1.75 to $35.75, while Magna edged down 6.25 cents to $24.81 Tuesday on Nasdaq.

32,"Retailers are expected to post sales gains in the single digits for March, bolstered by low-end discount stores sales while department store performance was nearly flat compared with a year ago.
""It appears there's a slowdown in the department store end of the business, but the discounters are still doing well,"" Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said.
Overall, he expects comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be up about 5 percent or slightly less.
An early Easter could depress sales at stores that were closed on the holiday, which fell in the March selling period instead of April this year. Winter storms in much of the northern part of the nation may have also held sales back.
""You need to look at March and April overall to get comparable sales,"" William Armstrong, an analyst at Fahnestock &amp; Co. Inc. said of quirks in the reporting calendar, where some retailers include Easter in March and others in April this year.
Armstrong is expecting overall retail sales for March to increase by 2 percent to 4 percent.
Most retailers will report March sales early Thursday. But Plano, Tex.-based J.C. Penney Co. Inc. Tuesday reported a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales at its JCPenney stores in March. The early report was due to a debt offering the company is making this week.
The loss of one day's sales because of Easter hurt sales, J.C. Penney said.
Penney's decline is expected to be mirrored by other department stores, analysts said.
""Most (department store) chains saw flat or even slightly lower comparable sales during the March period, as they compared with healthy year-ago increases,"" analysts at Montgomery Securities wrote in a research report. They added that the early Easter and snowstorms in the Northeast added to pressure on sales.
At the same time, discount stores are expected to post 4 percent to 6 percent sales gains, with low-end discounters reporting low double-digit gains, Montgomery said.
""We continue to believe the low-end strata is benefitting from the fruits of a fully-employed economy and the direct pay-hike from the 1996 minimum wage increase,"" Montgomery's analysts wrote.
Among the major chains, analysts see Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, reporting same-store sales gains of about 7 percent. Sears, Roebuck and Co. was expected to report gains of 2 percent to 3 percent, with Kmart Corp. up 10 percent to 12 percent.
Kmart's results are expected to be driven by seasonal items, such as horticulture, home goods and bicycles. But it will give back some of those gains in April because of the calendar shift, analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a research note. Kmart stores were open on Easter, analysts added.
Dayton Hudson Corp. is expected to post a 1 percent to 2 percent gain, with a 3 percent to 4 percent increase at its Target discount stores offsetting flat department store sales. Federated Department Stores Inc. is expected to post flat sales, with some planned promotions moved into April, analysts said.

32,"Mercury Finance Co.'s woes deepened Friday when the company said it would be unable to pay $17 million in commercial debt due the same day, and its stock lost nearly 90 percent of its value.
The stock lost $13 to $1.875 on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of more than 27 million shares after it opened for trading Friday afternoon for the first time since Tuesday. It fell as low as $1.625.
Based on the more than 172 million shares outstanding as of early November, that would mean a loss of more than $2.2 billion in market capitalisaiton for the company.
On Wednesday, the company said it found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years.
The consumer finance company said Friday that as a result of downgrades from several debt rating services, it would not be able to issue new short-term debt, known as commercial paper, to repay maturing debt and could not make the payments due Friday.
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Fitch Investors Service downgraded the company's commercial paper to a default rating.
Lake Forest, Ill.-based Mercury said it was in discussions with its lenders to satisfy its working capital needs, but could not predict the outcome of the discussions.
The company also said it had retained the services of Salomon Brothers Inc. to advise on its current and future capital needs, as well as all related issues.
Mercury said Wednesday it had to restate its earnings for the past four years by a total of about $90 million lower because of accounting irregularities.
Mercury said the problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its controller, James Doyle.
But Doyle's lawyer reportedly accused Mercury of a charade and said Doyle was cooperating with federal authorities.
A special committee of Mercury's board, formed to investigate the accounting problems, has instructed its lawyers to contact Doyle's attorney, to attempt to reach Doyle and to obtain information on the investigation, Mercury said Friday.
Doyle's lawyer was out of town Friday and did not return repeated phone calls.
The company said it also directed its lawyers and accounting firm to expeditiously complete a thorough investigation of the auditing, accounting practices and procedures of the company and report to the board.
Another class-action lawsuit accusing the company of violating securities laws by issuing misleading and false financial statements was filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago. At least four such suits have been filed.

32,"Retailers looking for a post-Christmas rush to boost lukewarm holiday sales may be disappointed as snow in some areas and holiday exhaustion kept many shoppers from bargain-hunting Thursday.
""I think people did their shopping"" before Christmas, said John Konarski, vice president at the International Council of Shopping Centers, a group of retail mall operators that surveys 85 large regional malls across the country.
""You're going to have some people out today (but) you're not going to see the massive crowds some people expected.""
Konarski said he expected that holiday season sales would be up 4 percent to 6 percent from a year ago, which is about what he expected before the season began.
But after strong activity in the weekend following Thanksgiving, retailers' hopes for even better sales ended up being dashed by a slowdown in the week before Christmas.
""I think generally, the overall picture appears to be we had a good, solid holiday sales period, but not a spectacular one,"" said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, which represents major store chains.
She said she expects holiday sales rose about 5 percent from last year, when gains were a weak 2.5 percent to 3 percent.
Store officials and analysts said that while sales were coming in at or just below retailers' expectations, that still beats the dismal results last year.
""They slowed up very moderately, actually, from the input we're getting,"" said Jay Meltzer, managing director of LJR Redbook Research. ""You know, we didn't go over a cliff and a year ago we did go over a cliff.""
In Chicago, snow and cold weather appeared to be keeping crowds down in the Michigan Avenue shopping district the day after Christmas.
""Sales today are relatively slow compared to before Christmas,"" said Julie Towson, manager of the Knot Crazy tie store in Water Tower Place. ""I think a lot of people spent all of their money before the holiday. Also, who wants to come out in this kind of weather?""
In central New York State, where it was also snowing, Konarski said there were lines at malls before stores opened at 7 a.m. EST (1200 GMT), but most shoppers were looking for markdowns on holiday accessories and to return merchandise.
In Cleveland, many workers were on vacation and some offices were closed, and shopper traffic at the Tower City Center mall complex was moderate.
""We've had a good, strong season,"" said the manager of a women's clothing store who has worked in retailing 11 years. ""Business today is pretty good. Volume is moderate.""
At Tower City's AnnTaylor store, sales associate Mary Rogonjich said Thursday morning traffic was slow but she expected things to pick up during lunch hour.
""Things have been steady this morning, and we have not had that many returns,"" she said. ""We've had a very good season -- above plan."" The store was offering up to 50 percent off on silk blouses, pants, jackets, shoes and other items on Thursday.
In Miami, some shops were seeing more traffic.
""The store is very busy. Really everything is marked down,"" said a spokeswoman at Federated Department Stores Inc.'s Macy's store in Miami's Falls mall.
But analysts said that while promotions picked up before Christmas and would accelerate this week, special discounts were fewer and less steep than last year, which should help retailer profits.
""Some retailers did get promotional in the last few days,"" Mullin said. ""I think you'll see it really starting today.""
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said in a telephone message for investors on Monday that discount and warehouse sales were at the low end of plan for the holidays in the third week of December.
The company is in line for sales increases of 4 percent to 5 percent for November and December, the company said.
Dayton Hudson Corp. said on Tuesday sales were meeting expectations and that the company had planned its inventories well.
Sears, Roebuck and Co. said overall sales and sales at stores open at least a year were showing upper-single digit increases.
""Overall sales were strong the last three days before Christmas,"" Vice President of Marketing John Costello said, noting that clothing, tools, jewelry, multimedia computers and tires sold well.

32,"A brisk start to holiday shopping should help retailers post solid sales gains for November and make this season merrier than last year for the nation's store chains, industry analysts said Tuesday.
But quirks in the calendar, with a later Thanksgiving this year, and some retailers tallying sales differently than others, could obscure overall results for November.
Industry analysts said they expect sales at stores open at least a year to rise 2.5 percent to 4.0 percent overall in November, with clothing continuing to be a strong contributor, as it was in October.
Most retailers report November sales on Thursday, though Paul Harris Stores Inc., a speciality women's apparel chain, reported November same-store sales up 26 percent from a year ago on Tuesday.
""We think the majority of companies are going to be on or above plan for the month of November, with good inventory levels,"" said Harry Ikenson, retail analyst at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc. ""We think the promotional level for Thanksgiving was high, but probably no higher than last year.""
With discounts and markdowns no higher and in some cases lower than last year, and inventories being managed tightly, profit margins should improve, helping to lift fourth quarter earnings, analysts said.
""On balance, good business now is going to translate into decent earnings,"" said Dean Ramos at Dain Bosworth Inc. Ramos said his index of sales could be one to two points higher than the 3.1 percent rise reported last year and that the trend should continue through December.
""Absent some sort of event that shakes the consumer you should see good retail sales"" in December, he said.
Holiday sales are crucial to retailers who typically earn a quarter or more of the year's profits during the season, analysts said. Steady economic growth and low unemployment have helped boost sales so far, and store chains should also benefit from easy comparisons with weak results a year ago.
Consumers got off to a fast start on their holiday shopping after Thanksgiving, analysts said.
Retail consumer spending in the post-Thanksgiving weekend rose 4.3 percent from a year ago, according to TeleCheck Services, which tracks check-writing volume. Overall, same-store sales rose 2.1 percent, TeleCheck said.
Several department store operators were expcted to be among the winners when sales are reported on Thursday.
Rodman &amp; Renshaw's Ikenson said he expected J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and May Department Stores Co. to be above expectations, with Penney's same-store sales up 7.5 percent to 8 percent and May's up 6 percent to 7 percent. Federated Department Stores Inc. should be up 7 percent to 9 percent, with gains in all its segments, he said.
Ikenson said he sees Charming Shoppes Inc. slightly below expectations with a gain of 5 percent.
Dean Witter analyst Patrick McCormack said in a research report he expected sames store sales to be up 3 percent in the month for the firm's index of 44 companies.
He also saw JC Penney, May, and Federated above expectations, as well as Sears, Roebuck and Co.
Sears was forecast by analysts to post a smaller-than-expected decline of 1 percent to 2 percent, which is due to a quirk in the company's sales reporting calendar that should help boost results in December.
Sears Senior Executive Vice President John Costello said on Sunday that post-Thanskgiving sales appeared to be up across the board, from men's and children's clothing to Craftsman tools to fine jewelry.
""Optimism is up and it looks like consumers are responding to the short season by getting an earlier start,"" he said.
Most analyts expect big-ticket consumer electronics to continue to be weak, though one saw some signs of a pickup in sales at the end of the month.
""Sears and Wal-Mart over the last week talked about a pickup in the computer area,"" said Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. He forecast sales overall up 2.5 percent for November at a comparable number of stores.

32,"First Chicago NBD Corp said Wednesday rising bankruptcy filings contributed to a rise in credit card charge offs in the fourth quarter.
Charge offs rose to 6.7 percent of managed receivables in the quarter, compared to 5.9 percent a year ago.
""The fourth quarter increase is due to a combination of factors, including a resurgence of bankruptcy filings after a third quarter lull, an increase in contractual charge offs, and average loan volume that was basically flat in the third quarter,"" chief financial officer Robert Rosholt said.  
But in a telephone message to investors, Rosholt also noted that credit card fee revenue rose 28 percent from a year ago to $259 million, adjusting for securitization.
""Clearly this demonstrates bank card's ability to counter some of the effects of deteriorating credit quality,"" he said.
While the credit card business continues to be profitable for the $104.6 billion asset bank holding company, some analysts noted the charge-off rate was high.
""I think that's very clear that that's not as profitable an operation as it is at other places,"" said James Schutz, analyst at Chicago Corp.  
But other analysts said the bank has tightened credit standards in the past year and were less concerned about the charge-off rate.
""That thing has bounced around all over this year (1996) and it's still a very profitable line of business this year,"" said Robert Ollech, analyst at Principal Financial Securities.
Rosholt also said the bank plans to improve its trading operations to restore results in market-driven revenues.  
Market-driven revenues were $83 million in the fourth quarter, up from $40 million in the previous quarter but down from the bank's average of $100 million a quarter, Rosholt said.
Trading profits were $12 million in the quarter, compared to a $12 million loss in the third quarter.
""We plan to get back to our $100 million per quarter average as we improve our execution of trading activities this year,"" Rosholt said.
Return on common equity was 17.5 percent in the quarter, up from 15.4 percent a year ago, while return on assets was 1.46 percent, up from 1.02 percent a year ago.
Earlier Wednesday, the bank reported operating income of $377 million or $1.14 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $318 million or $0.96 a year ago.
Earnings were $0.01 a share below estimates, according to First Call. First Chicago shares were up 1/8 at 54-3/8.

32,"Mercury Finance Co.  said Thursday it was suspending payment of a previously announced dividend while it tries to secure short-term financing as it falls deeper and deeper into debt.
The troubled consumer finance company said it had been unable to refinance a total of $61 million in commerical paper -- or short-term debt -- that had matured through Wednesday. Another $127 million comes due between Thursday and Feb. 14, Lake Forest, Ill.-based Mercury said.
The company has been in violation of certain loan covenants since last week, when it was unable to pay $17 million in commercial debt.
Mercury has been in turmoil since it announced last week that accounting irregularities had caused it to overstate its earnings by about $90 million.
It said accounting misstatements appeared to stem from unauthorised entries by former controller James Doyle. But Doyle's lawyer has accused the company of a ""charade"" and said Doyle is cooperating with federal authorities.
FBI agents served a search warrant seeking financial records Monday.
Mercury said Thursday that it suspended a dividend payment of 7.5 cents a share that was payable March 3.
The company also said it was continuing to try to obtain short-term financing from its lenders in talks that have been taking place all week. It added that funds from the short-term financing will be used exclusively for operating purposes and will not be available for paying principal or interest on company debt.
One analyst said the apparent lack of a report so far by new auditors on the extent of the accounting discrepancies might be hindering the talks with lenders.
""Certainly, (the talks are) complicated in one instance by the default on the commercial paper to date and what seems to be the lack of resolution on the extent and nature of the accounting regularities,"" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co.
Earlier this week William Brandt Jr., a turnaround and bankruptcy specialist who replaced John Brincat as chief executive officer on Monday, told Reuters the company needed about four weeks of financing to gain time to stabilise the firm.
Mercury, which makes used-car loans to individuals of often relatively low creditworthiness, also said Thursday that operations were continuing at all of the company's 280 locations nationwide.
Market sources said there had been rumours of bids for Mercury's commercial paper at 50 percent to 80 percent of face value. One attorney familiar with bankruptcy matters said bidders might be trying to have more influence if Mercury is forced to file for bankruptcy.
""It is not uncommon for investment groups to be buying paper at a discount to improve their situation in a restructuring,"" said Ted Koenig, attorney at Holleb &amp; Coff in Chicago.
Mercury was only one of several auto lenders to report deepening troubles Thursday.
Dallas-based Jayhawk Acceptance Corp.  said Thursday afternoon it would file a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, after saying its revolving credit lender plans to deliver it a default notice.
Jayhawk said last week it took a $15.5 million charge to fourth-quarter earnings to increase its allowance for credit losses after reevaluating the likelihood of recovering advances made to some dealers.
Evanston, Ill.-based First Enterprise Financial Group Inc. said it did not report 1996 earnings as expected Thursday and that it was reviewing its portfolio in light of recent developments in the industry.
An analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. lowered the company's stock to hold from buy.
""We believe the Mercury situation is causing audit firms to take a much harder position with automobile finance companies,"" Chicago Corp. said in a research report.
First Enterprise's stock plunged $3.375 to $8.875 on Nasdaq.
The fallout from Mercury's financial troubles is also striking a foundation established by Mercury founder Daniel Terra, who died in June. The foundation, which funds the Terra Museum of American Art in Chicago and an American museum in Giverny, France, holds 8 million shares as part of its $350 million endowment.
Those shares were worth more than $116 million a week ago, but were worth about $21 million Thursday.
Mercury's stock fell 25 cents to $2.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.

32,"Struggling to stay on course away from its troubled past, Trans World Airlines Inc. now must find a new chief executive to take the helm of the troubled carrier.
How quickly it can find an experienced airline executive for the job will determine whether it stays on course or runs into more financial trouble, industry analysts said.
The St. Louis-based airline said on Thursday that Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Erickson, who has headed the company for the past two years, will leave in January.
""The last thing that the company needs now is more management turmoil,"" said one analyst, who declined to be identified. ""It doesn't have a strong or stable enough footing to deal with this kind of stuff.""
Erickson's departure comes just four months after Chief Financial Officer Robert Peiser left the company. At the time, TWA said Peiser's decision to leave was over differences in management direction.
""They're going to have to regain the confidence of Wall Street,"" said William Fiala, who follows the airline industry for Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., which is based in TWA's hometown. ""The only way they're going to do that is by coming up with a leader that's a proven turnaround (manager), or well-respected in the industry.""
Erickson, who became chief executive officer in August 1994, brought the airline through its second bankruptcy reorganization and back to where it was buying new aircraft. But the turnaround is not finished, and higher fuel costs and the July 17 crash of Paris-bound Flight 800, which hurt confidence in the carrier and therefore its sales, have stalled the company's improvement.
""Erickson was the one who really steered them through the first half of the turnaround, but they still have a way to go,"" Fiala said.
The company on Thursday reported a $14.3 million third-quarter loss and said its yield, a measure of fares, fell in the quarter.
""I don't know specifically the reason he chose to depart now,"" said Don Jacobs, chairman of the TWA Master Executive Council of the Airline Pilots Associaition. ""I think it's probably an impact of the third quarter financials and Flight 800.""
TWA's unions have four seats on the company's board of directors and will play a part in choosing a successor for Erickson, Jacobs said, though he could not suggest possible replacements.
""We would expect that the board would replace Jeff with a top-notch airline manager,"" he said. ""As both employees and the stockholders in the company, we will be concerned and involved in that.""
Industry experts said TWA's board of directors might have become impatient with the pace of the turnaround after seeing the third-quarter results. But they also quickly defended Erickson's record at the company.
""When you see what TWA was three years ago and what it is now, it's a world of difference,"" said Michael Boyd, president of Aviation Systems Research Corp., a research and consulting firm  in Golden, Colo.
Calls to Erickson at TWA's offices Friday were transferred to a public relations office, which said he was unavailable for comment. TWA Chairman Thomas Meagher did not return calls.
Analysts said TWA's board would need to move quickly and that the next chief executive would need a good degree of independence from the board.
""Whatever they do to replace Erickson, they need a hands-on manager, not a messiah,"" Boyd said. ""In a situation like this, you have to have free reign. You can't have people behind you second-guessing every one of your moves.""
Boyd said several managers at United Airlines might be interested in the job. He also suggested that former Alaska Air Group Chief Executive Raymond Vecci could be a candidate.
Earlier this year, Erickson, who was criticized by families of the Flight 800 victims for the company's response to the crash, told students at Washington University in St. Louis that the aftermath of the crash was draining, said Stuart Greenbaum, dean of the university's business school.
""I can't help believing the crash just took a lot out of Jeff,"" said Greenbaum, who said he is a friend of Erickson's. ""That was so difficult for him, as it would be for any human being, to try to represent the company to the world"" after the tragedy, in which 230 died.
"
32,"H&amp;R Block Inc. Thursday reported a big loss for the latest quarter, as its CompuServe online service posted a $58 million loss and became more of a headache to its parent.
H&amp;R Block had a net loss of $74.1 million, or 71 cents a share, in its second quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues grew to $253.4 million from $221.0 million.
Kansas City-based H&amp;R Block, the nation's largest tax preparation company, blamed the bad news mainly on losses at its CompuServe unit, the world's second-largest online service, which has failed to sign up new subscribers, especially in the United States.
H&amp;R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe, after selling the rest of the stock in April in an initial step to spin off the unit.
But plans to complete the spin-off were suspended in August after CompuServe reported poor first-quarter earnings and projected second-quarter losses.
Just nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for a spinoff, arguing that CompuServe's value was being held back by H&amp;R Block's staid tax business.
Now they want a spinoff because the online services provider is weighing on H&amp;R Block's performance.
""The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe's valuation is clearly holding back H&amp;R Block's valuation,"" said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston.
""How quickly things change,"" said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. ""What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.) The market became saturated before people expected.""
Analysts said H&amp;R Block was waiting for CompuServe's new business strategy announced Thursday -- focusing on the corporate market rather than home users -- to push the unit toward profitability before the spinoff is completed.
H&amp;R Block also cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 32 cents, a move that it had previously said would occur after the spinoff was completed.
""Even though the separation has not been completed, the board decided such action was prudent at this time because CompuServe is not adding to the company's profitability,"" said Frank Salizzoni, H&amp;R Block's president and chief executive officer and CompuServe's chairman.
""In taking this action today, the board is indicating it anticipates the separation of CompuServe.""
Both Romm and Hudson said they continue to rate H&amp;R Block stock as a buy and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the company's core tax business.
The company said its Tax Services unit reported a pretax loss of $42.2 million in the second quarter, up $6.9 million a year ago.
""This year's deeper second quarter loss in these core businesses is in large part a result of the company's investments to expand its office network and roll out new products,"" Salizzoni said.
""They're making these investments primarily in new stores that are absorbing costs primarily without any commensurate contribution in revenue,"" Romm said, noting that the tax season does not begin until early next year.
H&amp;R Block stock fell 37.5 cents to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. CompuServe lost 93.75 cents to $10.6875 on Nasdaq.

32,"Case Corp said Tuesday it plans to spend $950 million in the next four years as part of an ongoing program to revamp its product line by the turn of the century.
""We have the goal to replace all the major (agricultural) products by the end of the century,"" Jean-Pierre Rosso, chief executive of the Racine, Wisconsin-based farming and construction equipment maker said in an interview. Many construction products will also be revamped.  
One major portion of that product overhaul, a new tractor series, will enter production this spring, Rosso said.
The MX Series tractors, which run from 85 to 115 horsepower, are in the midsize area of the tractor market, which represent about 30 percent of tractor sales worldwide for Case, Rosso said.
Orders in the United States and Europe have already exceeded company plans, Rosso said, although he would not disclose what those plans were.
""We have significant orders on both sides of the ocean already,"" he said.  
The tractor, which was recently unveiled, will be produced in Racine and the United Kingdom.
The switch from the German production site of Case's mid-sized tractors is expected to lower costs both from a labor and logistics stand point, Case said. The Racine and UK plants are also more efficient than the German plant. The new design utilizes more common components for models in different parts of the world, also bringing down costs, Case said.
Typically, the U.S. market has larger farms and looks for more horsepower, with wider implements. European farmers are looking for more advanced features on lower horsepower tractors, Rosso said.  
""The new design is much better matched to the needs and requirements of the customer base that it is targeted to,"" said J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. The pricing of the tractor will also be equivalent to products offered by competitor Deere &amp; Co, Brumley said.
The switch to the MX series tractors is expected to depress earnings in the first quarter, before boosting earnings later in the year, Case and analysts have said.
At the same time, Case is also introducing a premium tractor called the QuadTrak, which has also been well received.  
""There's more demand than we can supply this year,"" Rosso said of the QuadTrak, which is designed with four tracks to have better terrain handling and less soil compaction.
In the early phases of the QuadTrak introduction, Case will lease about half of those tractors in order to get more customer feedback, Rosso said.
Also this year, Case plans to introduce a new skid steer loader, a piece of construction equipment that can utilize many different attachments -- sort of the construction equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. The loader will be at the higher-margin heavy lift end of the product line, Rosso said.
""It gets us in a part of the market which we are not present,"" Rosso said.
Adding a new product to its skid steer line could help Case to face new competition in the market, Brumley said.
""They're number two in market share and that skid steer market is going to get real crowded,"" with offerings from other manufacturers, Brumley said.

43,"Heartport Inc leaped almost a year ahead of its scheduled plan for developing a new heart surgery technology thanks to an earlier-than-expected U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval granted on Monday.
As a result, analysts who had looked for Heartport to turn its first profit in 1999 are now talking about 1998.
For its part, the company plans a U.S. launch of its port-access surgical system in mid-1997. ""That's about a year earlier than we had previously expected,"" said chief executive Dr. Wesley Sterman in an interview with Reuters.  
Between now and then, Heartport plans to equip its six lead clinical training centers with port-access systems.
""We're targetting having 30 surgical teams trained by the end of the year, then drastically increasing our training capabilities over the next six to 12 months,"" Sterman said.
""Most analysts were looking at us crossing over (to profitability) in 1999. So maybe you could argue now that it could come in 1998, but I don't know that we would support that. I'm just saying what the analysts are doing,"" he said.
Shares in Heartport slipped 2 to 34-1/2 on Tuesday afer soaring as much as 7 on Monday after the FDA approval.  
Several medical technology firms are chasing the young market for minimally invasive heart surgery, in which surgeons work through small holes in the chest, instead of by cutting the chest open. Alone among potential rivals, Heartport is focused on a technique that stops the heart and puts the patient on a heart-lung bypass circuit like those used today in traditional open-heart surgery.
Other companies, such as CardioThoracic Systems Inc and Medtronic Inc, are focused on beating-heart techniques that eliminate heart-lung bypass. U.S. Surgical Corp is also working in the field.

43,"Merger and acquisition activity is expected to pick up this year in the beleaguered U.S. nursing homes and sub-acute care facilities industry.
After miserably under-performing the market over the past two years, stocks of nursing home companies have bifurcated into ""haves and have-nots,"" analysts said.
A few top companies are at the point where they have worked through some problems. Their stock values have absorbed market uncertainties about Medicare and Medicaid reform, and the next year or two look uncustomarily predictable, analysts said.  
At the same time, the have-nots of the business continue to be dogged by company-specific difficulties that have held down their values, presenting possible bargains.
""There is a divergence in valuations and the industry is in the process of changing ... it is perhaps on the verge of an urge to merge,"" said Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette healthcare industry analyst John Hindelong.
Talk of more rapid consolidation was fueled Monday by Louisville, Ky.-based Vencor Inc's agreement to acquire TheraTx Inc, of Alpharetta, Ga., for $550 million in cash, convertible securities and debt assumption.  
""There seem to be a lot of companies or pieces of companies that are sort of being walked about...There's just a lot of activity,"" said National Securities healthcare industry analyst Michael LeConey.
""Sentiment is improving among the companies in the better half of the industry. You may see some consolidation,"" said ABN AMRO Chicago Corp healthcare industry analyst Gregory Moerschel.
The U.S. nursing home and sub-acute care industry -- comprising about 15,000 facilities nationwide -- enjoys a compelling demographic and structural profile, analysts said.  
As baby-boomers age and managed care drives more medical procedures and patients out of high-cost acute-care hospitals, owners of facilities that can look after the aged and the chronically or mildly ill would seem to stand to benefit.
""Just looking at the numbers, this industry should be booming, but it isn't,"" said John Cumming, chief executive of WDI Capital Markets Inc, a healthcare investment banking firm.
Growth by acquisition has been the rule in the highly fragmented industry and few firms have shown themselves able to manage it well. The result often has been over-expansion, disarray and restructuring, analysts said.  
After a bumpy two years, top-tier players -- such as Vencor and Manor Care Inc -- are in a position to snap up smaller firms, analysts said. Also seen as likely acquirers are Genesis Health Ventures Inc and Integrated Health Services Inc in the home healthcare market.
Identified by some analysts as possible targets were Burbank, Calif.-based Summit Care Corp and Retirement Care Associates Inc, of Atlanta.
Retirement Care said Thursday it purchased 1.95 million more shares of Contour Medical Inc, a manufacturer of orthopedic and rehabilitative products. The transaction boosted Retirement Care's stake in Florida-based Contour to about 65.3 percent of total outstanding common stock.  
Neither Retirement Care nor Summit could be reached for further comment.
Sun Healthcare Group Inc was seen as likely doing a major deal soon, although some analysts said it would be a buyer and others said it would be a seller.
Albuquerque, N.M.-based Sun announced Thursday it acquired nine nursing home and assisted living facilities from  Clipper Affiliates in New Hampshire for $12 million plus assumption of leases at $6 million per year. A spokeswoman for Sun declined to comment on speculation of the possibility of a larger transaction.
Companies seen as pressured to make strategic moves of some sort were industry giant Beverly Enterprises Inc, Living Centers of America Inc, GranCare Inc and Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp.

43,"TheraTx Inc does not expect the federal government to implement new guidelines for certain key Medicare reimbursement rates until the summer of 1997, postponing until then any likely damage to the health care services concern's profitability.
""It's a government reimbursement change which is forthcoming. It will definitely pressure our earinings, there's no doubt about it,"" chief financial officer Donald Myll said in an interview.  
Like other companies that provide rehabilitation services to patients mostly in nursing homes, TheraTx has been waiting for two years for action from Washington on the reimbursement issue.
The company's stock has been depressed during that time by a market unjustifiably focused on one issue, Myll said following a presentation to investors at a Robinson-Humphrey conference here on Tuesday.
""At this point, I'd rather have bad news on salary equivalency than what we have now, which is no news,"" Myll said, referring to the issue.  
Public since 1994, Alpharetta, Ga.-based TheraTx operates 29 nursing homes and provides rehabilitation services on contract to dozens of other nursing homes companies. The firm also runs several occupational health clinics.
The rehabilitation division provides about 45 percent of revenues and offers three main forms of therapy: speech, occupational and physical.  
Most revenues in the rehabilitation area come from Medicare, the federal healthcare program for the elderly. The U.S. Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, has been rewriting its reimbursement rules for speech, occupational and physical therapy since October 1994.
If HCFA proceeds with its latest set of reforms, TheraTx could see 1997 earnings come in flat to down compared to this year's level, Myll said.
Much remains to be determined, however, he said. Moreover, despite market concerns, the potential earnings hit from the changes is not large enough to hurt TheraTx seriously, he said.  
""There's no real threat. It's a one-time pricing issue.... The market has no clue on this,"" Myll said.
TheraTx on Tuesday reported third-quarter profits of $0.29 per share, up from $0.26 per share a year ago. The First Call consensus earnings forecast for the third quarter was $0.30 per share.
""The general performance of the company is on track. Whether (1996 per-share net) is $1.17 or $1.12 is not for me to say...but I would guess that analysts are probably going to revise their estimates downward because the third quarter was a couple pennies below the consensus,"" Myll said.
The First Call 1996 earnings estimate range is $1.15-$1.20 per share.
TheraTx shares closed Tuesday up 3/8 at 10-1/2.

43,"U.S. consumers are greeting the latest home computers -- faster than ever, but lacking new whiz-bang features -- with a collective yawn.
Major U.S. electronics retailers said Thursday that home PC sales were weak in October and analysts see few signs of a recovery without lower prices or a technology breakthrough.
""Everybody seems to have stopped buying PCs all of a sudden,"" said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Terrence McEvoy.
Defying the downdraft are mail-order computer vendors and sellers of computers to business, which are both thriving.  
Their success reflects a shifting market, analysts said.
""The business today is less first-time buyers and more repeat customers,"" said Robertson Stephens analyst Edward Lee.
The pool of entry-level buyers is contracting and the PC industry increasingly relies on second- or third-time buyers, who are smarter than novices. Veterans look for vendors offering lots of peripherals, such as CompUSA Inc, or discount mail-order houses, such as Dell Computer Corp and Gateway 2000 Inc, analysts said.
That leaves generalists, like Best Buy Co and Circuit City Stores, to fight for a shrinking market.  
Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Best Buy, with 268 stores in 31 states, reported October sales were down 15 percent from a year ago on a same-store basis and said ""the sale of personal computers was impacted by industry-wide weakness.""
Richmond, Va.-based Circuit City saw an October decline in same-store sales of nine percent and cited ""softness in the personal computer and ... consumer electronics categories.""
Disappointing results were posted by Tandy Corp, owner of the RadioShack, Computer City and Incredible Universe chains. ""Our results parallel the sluggish consumer electronics and personal computer retail market,"" Tandy said.  
""Demand is starting to dry up across the board,"" Lee said.
Best Buy shares Thursday fell 3-1/4 to 13 on the October report. Circuit City shares were up 3/8 to 34-7/8. Shares in Fort Worth, Texas-based Tandy were off 3/4 to 38-3/4.
At the same time, shares in Dell were up 1-1/2 to 88-5/8, while Gateway 2000 shares were up 3-3/4 to 52-3/4. Shares in computer and microprocessor manufacturers also rallied, with Intel Corp up 5-3/4 to 124-5/8 and International Business Machines Corp up 1 to 134-1/4.  
PC sales at this time last year were buoyed by promotions and the multi-media explosion. The home PC was transformed from a word processor into a high-quality game station and an educational tool for kids thanks to CD-ROM drives, speakers and soundcard packages and a bevy of new applications.
""Today, computers are faster than they were a year ago, but what does it do more?"" Lee asked. ""Demand is driven by applications and how it changes the typical consumer's life.""
Savvy consumers could just be waiting for lower prices, of course, and analysts said if they keep dropping, there may yet be a holiday buying burst. But without some hot new features, the shopping season for PC retailers could be a cold one.
""When you've got Intel moving up five in one day and Best Buy moving down three the same day, that tells you something ... It's a tough business,"" said Securities Corp of Iowa analyst Pat Dunkerley.

43,"Monsanto Co. said on Monday it will spin off its chemicals business in a long-awaited and costly move that will allow the company to focus on its faster-growing agriculture, food and healthcare units.
Between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs will be eliminated in the transaction, causing the company to take a $400 million to $600 million fourth-quarter charge against earnings, it said.
""What they're trying to create is one company that's clearly focused on growth and one that's clearly focused on efficiency,"" said Smith Barney industry analyst James Wilbur.
St. Louis, Mo.-based Monsanto is a far-flung conglomerate whose varied products include Roundup weed killer, NutraSweet sweetener, carpet fibers, and drugs for treating arthritis and insomnia, as well as genetically engineered corn and soybeans.
Wall Street had long expected the giant company, which has about $8.9 billion in annual sales, to break itself up.
""It was a fait accompli,"" Wilbur said. ""The market likes companies that are less diversifed.""
The pared-down Monsanto will focus on its higher-profit margin agricultural, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology businesses, a spokesman said.
The new chemicals business will have to emphasize production efficiencies in a market subject to cyclical sales trends and intense global competition, analysts said.
""After careful consideration, we're convinced these businesses must operate separately to reach their maximum potential and thereby unlock significant value in both,"" Monsanto Chairman Robert Shapiro said.
Shapiro will head the post-spin-off Monsanto and Executive Vice President Robert Potter, who runs the chemicals business, will run the new company, still unnamed, Monsanto said.
The scope of job cuts coming with the spin-off has not been determined, but more details will likely be available by the end of January, a spokesman said.
Monsanto employs 28,500 people around the world. The anticipated cuts would reduce that headcount by 5 percent to 9 percent, the company said.
The tax-free spin-off proposed would create a new firm by the end of 1997. Current Monsanto shareholders would keep their Monsanto shares and get shares in the new concern as a special dividend, the company said.
Monsanto said its directors approved the spin-off.
The company also said the exact amount of the after-tax charge, which is to cover the costs of job reductions, asset and equipment write-offs, and consolidation of some manufacturing and offices, would be fixed at a later date.
Analysts estimated the one-time charge would total between 80 cents and $1 per share.
Monsanto, which reported 1995 profits of $739 million, or $1.25 a share, is expected to post per-share profits for 1996 of $1.50, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' projections.
Monsanto said in October it was considering options for its chemicals business, which had about $3 billion in 1995 revenues but is growing less rapidly than other units and is subject to more ups and downs.
""Chemicals would hurt the multiple of the company if they held onto it ... because the chemicals growth rate is not as high as the agriculturals growth rate and the earnings are more cyclical,"" said PaineWebber industry analyst Paul Raman.
The chemicals business -- making acrylic carpet fibers, plastic interlayers for glass, industrial phosphorus compounds and other products -- was shopped around for months, but no buyer was found, in part for tax reasons, analysts said.
Monsanto said the spin-off requires shareholder approval and clearance by government agencies and the Internal Revenue Service for it to be tax-free.
The spin-off is intended to be completed no later than the end of next year. Until then, the two companies will operate separately within Monsanto beginning early next year, it said.
Monsanto's stock slipped 37.5 cents to $40.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

43,"If the weather cooperates, U.S. retailers expect this weekend to cap a holiday shopping season that looks moderately better than last year's, despite being shorter by five days.
""This weekend is crucial,"" said Prudential Securities retail analyst Wayne Hood in Atlanta. ""With the snow and cold weather, it's a little too early to tell. ... But on balance, it should be a better holiday sales season than last year.""
Warmer weather is forecast for much of the country this weekend following a cold snap that rattled some regions.
A blast of arctic air slowed shopping earlier this week in Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa and Nebraska, said Susan Eich, spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based retailer Dayton Hudson Corp., which owns Target, Mervyn's and three department store chains.
Cold, wet weather in the Northeast dampened midweek shopping in the New York area, analysts said.
Snow fell Wednesday in Atlanta. And south Florida felt an unfamiliar chill Friday, but the retail impact was minimal. ""It looks fairly good. ... Down here they're buying,"" said J.W. Charles Securities retail analyst Allen Roness in Boca Raton, Fla. The registers are ringing in California as well, where weather has not been a problem, said Robertson Stephens retail analyst Edward Weller in San Francisco. ""It's going to be a reasonably good Christmas for American consumers and a very good one for retailers,"" he said.
He noted, however, that some sectors are outperforming others. Clothing sales are strong, reflecting perhaps the closings this past year of hundreds of apparel retailers, Weller said.
On the other hand, home computer sales continue to look anemic and prices are coming down fast. ""Consumer demand for computers is, in technical terms ... poor,"" Weller said.
There are five fewer shopping days this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas compared with 1995. As a result, retailers have that much less time to meet their sales targets and consumers have that much less time to shop and compare.
""Everybody knew it going in. So they got the ads out early and put the decorations up early,"" said A.G. Edwards retail analyst Stephen Latz in St. Louis, where warmer weather is forecast for the weekend.
Staring down the barrel of a shortened season, retailers have begun some sales promotions, but last year's huge price markdowns so far are not being matched, Latz said.
""I don't think anybody has gone nuts like they did in past years,"" he said. ""It's going to be the best season in the last few years, but those five fewer days are a lot to overcome ... That's going to be the story.""

43,"North American garbage companies can be expected to continue picking over each others' assets as big firms sell off money-losers and small players consolidate, the top executives of the biggest haulers and handlers of waste said on Monday.
At a conference held by the Raymond James brokerage and investment bank, a half dozen trash hauling companies made presentations to investors. In all the talks, asset strategy figured prominently.  
In the top tier of the industry, the two biggest U.S. firms -- WMX Technologies Inc and Browning Ferris Industries Inc -- control about a quarter of the $35 billion solid waste market.
Both WMX and BFI are fast shedding non-core and unprofitable operations as they reposition and rationalize after years of undisciplined acquisitions, analysts said. At the same time, Canadian giant Laidlaw Inc is transforming itself into a transportation company and leaving the solid waste market, as well as the $3.5 billion hazardous waste market, in which it had dominated in North America.  
At the lower levels, fast-growing mid-sized companies -- such as USA Waste Services Inc, United Waste Systems Inc and Superior Services Inc -- are playing the consolidation game. By sifting through the giants' dross and snapping up deals from among dozens of small, private firms, the mid-cap players are growing rapidly.
""At the end of the day, you'll have an industry that has sorted through its asset base so that several companies will be better positioned,"" said Todd Holmes, vice president at Browing Ferris, based in Houston.  
Trash hauling and handling turned into a hot business in North America in the 1970s with the rise of environmentalism and stricter government regulation of polluters. Riding a wave of rapid consolidation in a highly fragmented industry, innovators like WMX and BFI experienced explosive growth. In its first 20 years, industry leader WMX made 2,000 acquisitions.
But the boom years ended in the 1990s with a levelling of environmental regulation, greater market concentration among companies and a surplus of supply in several key markets.  
In addition, added Laidlaw chief executive James Bullock, ""The focus of solid waste handling is migrating away from landfill to recycling, which has lower (profit) margins and suffers from the vagaries of commodity prices.""
For WMX and BFI, too, growth by acquisition hit an inevitable ceiling as the pool of affordable targets dried up.
""The consolidation strategy was unsustainable for us,"" said WMX chief financial officer John Sanford.
Oak Brook, Ill.-based WMX reacted to these changes by diversifying in the 1990s into related businesses, but the strategy failed, leading to shareholder disappointment.  
Laidlaw, based in Burlington, Ont., has separated itself from its solid and hazardous waste operations. It still owns sizable stakes in the successor companies -- Laidlaw Environmental Services and Allied Waste Industries Inc -- but expects to sell its interests, valued at a combined $1.2 billion.
""Over time, you will see us exit our investments in both of those,"" Bullock said in an interview with Reuters.
At the next level down, growth by acquisition continues. The business has virtually no barriers to entry -- any outfit with a half-dozen garbage trucks can get a route and make itself a takeover target.
As a result, Bullock said, ""The little guys are still playing the consolidation game...They can be successful at that for a while.""

43,"A lower than expected third quarter sales growth rate may explain why shares in Guidant Corp closed off 2-7/8 to 46-1/2 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, said Guidant chief executive Ronald Dollens.
""There was some expectation of higher sales growth rates,"" Dollens said in an interview with Reuters.
Sales increased 11 percent on the quarter against the year-ago period. ""Last quarter our sales were up 18 percent,"" Dollens said. ""They were looking for a higher sales number ... I think that's what caused the consternation.""  
Sales would have been up 13 percent if not for the negative impact of exchange rate translations, he said.
About 39 percent of the medical device manufacturer's sales are in non-U.S. markets. Unfavorable exchange rates hit hardest in Japan in the third quarter, Dollens said.
Guidant posted earnings of $41.2 million, or $0.57 per share, on sales of $260.1 million. A year ago, earnings were $28 million, or $0.39 per share, on sales of $234.1 million.
""Earnings were up 47 percent. They were above Street expectations, but the stock's getting hit. That is a hard one to understand,"" Dollens said.  
Analysts' concerns focused on Guidant's vascular intervention business, which saw a sales decline in the third quarter to $104.7 million from $108.4 million a year earlier.
""Revenues there were a little lower than expected,"" said Hilliard Lyons analyst Stephen O'Neil. ""It relates to the stent business here in the U.S.... Right now they're not positioned quite right in that market, but I think they will be.""
Guidant's U.S. sales of devices based on the most widely used stent technolgy are growing, but not enough to offset some erosion in other areas, Dollens said.  
Guidant expects to introduce two catheters into the U.S. market this quarter. ""Then the truly important step will be when we get our stent approved in the United States,"" Dollens said, adding the ACS Multi-Link stent is selling in Europe.
""We did $14 million of stent sales internationally this quarter,"" Dollens said. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration trial is under way for the new stent. Patients who have received implants must now be tracked for nine months.

43,"By selling its Snapple beverage business for $300 million, Quaker Oats Co on Thursday both disappointed and relieved Wall Street.
The price was far lower than analysts following the company said they had hoped Quaker would be able to get.
""It was a fire-sale price.  I'd been using $600 to $700 million"" as an estimated value for Snapple, said Prudential Securities food industry analyst John McMillin.
At the same time, analysts said they were relieved that Quaker was ending its disastrous Snapple venture.  
""The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back,"" said BT Securities food industry analyst John O'Neil.
Shares in Quaker were up 3/8 to 37-7/8 in late morning on heavy volume, after trading as high as 39-1/2.  Shares in Triarc Cos Inc, which is buying the Snapple line from Quaker, were up one to 16-3/4 after trading as high as 18.
Triarc owns the Mistic and Royal Crown beverage lines, as well as Arby's Inc fast-food restaurants and liquefied petroleum and specialty dyes and chemicals businesses.  
Chicago-based Quaker bought Snapple for $1.8 billion, including acquisition costs, two-and-a-half years ago near the height of the alternative beverage brand's popularity.
Since the purchase, widely seen by analysts as overvalued, Quaker has struggled with the line of ready-to-drink teas and juices.  Snapple sales declined eight percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, and the business ran at a cash loss, the company reported last month.
""The bad news is the (Snapple) investment's been a disaster; the good news is they're trying to put it behind them,"" McMillin said.
Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life.
""Quaker still has the crown jewels -- Gatorade and the cereals -- and performance in those businesses has been pretty good,"" said PaineWebber food industry analyst George Staphos.

43,"The Food and Drug Administration is approving new drugs and medical devices at a rapid clip this year, heartening drug and device companies that have long criticised the agency.
In the federal fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the agency cleared for U.S. marketing 46 new drugs, up from 26 approvals in fiscal 1995, the agency said.
In the same period, 37 new medical devices were cleared, up from 27 the year before, according to a tally kept by Montgomery Securities, an investments firm.
""What you are seeing is the culmination of improvements in the review system that date back 10 years or more,"" said FDA associate commissioner for public affairs Jim O'Hara.
Even long-time FDA critic the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PHARMA, sounded congratulatory, albeit with reservations. ""Improvments have been made in the last couple of years,"" said Jeff Trewhitt, PHARMA spokesman.
Two bills before Congress that proposed more flexible and shorter FDA new drug reviews died without action with the adjournment of the House and Senate last week, a sign that the agency's actions have blunted attacks from outside critics.
Drug and medical device industry analysts said faster FDA approvals are helping companies in both sectors by reducing their research and development risks.
A year ago, companies had complained that burdensome U.S. regulatory oversight threatened to drive U.S. drug and medical technology research to Europe, known for speedier reviews.
But a study released this spring showed the FDA's median review time for new drugs approved in 1994 and 1995 was 1.3 years, as fast as that of Britain and faster than those of France, Spain, Germany, Australia, Japan, Italy and Canada, according to the FDA. The study was conducted by the British-based Centre for Medicines Research, the agency said.
""In 1996, the U.S. is reviewing and approving ... faster than any other country,"" O'Hara said.
He credited internal reforms at the FDA largely to passage by Congress in 1992 of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which made more money available to the agency through a system of user fees imposed on companies.
Those revenues have paid for the hiring of more reviewers and upgrading of FDA information systems, he said.

30,"Russia's powerful Gazprom GAZP.RTS pushed back a plan on Wednesday to issue more share look-alikes for foreigners, saying it needed time to clear out its massive debts to give its stock time to appreciate.
But the company also issued a challenge to the government to meet it half way as it struggles to make tax and other payments which are crucial to the functioning of Russia's economy.
Eduard Ivanov, director of securities at the world's largest natural gas producer, told a news conference RAO Gazprom planned to issue a second tranche of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) next year, not this year as previously planned.
""We consider it expedient to place this tranche in 1998... However the exact timing has not yet been set,"" he said.
He said Gazprom still planned to start issuing convertible bonds this year and that the ADSs would be sold on U.S. markets.
But company officials said one reason for the ADS delay was Gazprom's tortuous efforts to find a common language with the government -- once its unquestioning supporter -- on payments by the giant company into the budget and state funds.
Much is at stake. Gazprom accounted for 26 percent of Russia's 1996 tax revenue -- a whopping figure which underscores the wealth of the company and its key role in Moscow's efforts to plug the budget deficit and keep market reforms on track.
Gazprom, with a market capitalisation of $16.5 billion, accounts for over one-third of global gas reserves, 95 percent of Russian gas output and 39 percent of the world's gas trade.
""We are taking the responsibility to pay our debts,"" Pyotr Rodionov, deputy chairman of Gazprom's board and a former energy minister, said. ""But we also demand the government take steps to meet us halfway, especially in planning the 1998 budget.""
""It's time for the state to conduct itself correctly with regard to payments from energy companies,"" he said, referring to what he thought were unrealistic state revenue targets.
Gazprom has been the target of attacks by the cabinet's fresh-faced reformers, who have promised the giant will not be broken up but want it to pay its corporate and other debts.
Gazprom argues that its consumers -- mostly gas-fired power plants and industrial enterprises -- are late payers fuelling a payments crisis whose blame is laid at Gazprom's door.
The company -- once a ministry, once headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and now quite coveted by foreign investors -- took pains last month to say peace had broken out in talks with the cabinet on its arrears.
Gazprom said it still owed 3.5 trillion roubles ($608 million), down from an estimated 14.8 trillion ($2.6 billion).
But Rodionov said the two sides needed common understanding.
""We must first sort out our relations to the state,"" he said, describing what needed to happen before Gazprom offered more of its equity to foreign investors. ""That is the element which will facilitate growth in our share price.""
In a sign the government is still sympathetic to Gazprom's problems, a senior official said on Tuesday one option would be to transfer assets of indebted power companies to Gazprom. Gazprom's first tranche of ADSs, issued in October 1996 and listed in London, set foreign investors drooling. The company plans to make nine percent of its capital available to foreign investors -- who currently own less than two percent.
It accounts for 60 percent of Europe's gas imports but plans to sell even more by raising capital abroad for its $45 billion Yamal project linking Arctic gas fields to Western consumers.
Some of the money will come from the ADSs; other from a bridging loan of $1.2 billion and medium term credits of up to $3 billion dollars, for which Gazprom has mandated banks Credit Lyonnais and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
A Gazprom official who declined to be identified said ABN-Amro and Goldman Sachs -- which were awarded but lost the mandates -- would probably still arrange Gazprom's planned Eurobond.
""Every bank wants to work with us,"" Rodionov said. ""Of course it's a competitive battle.""
Gazprom has a strictly-divided share structure separating paper available on the Russian market from that on foreign markets, where ADSs effectively cost three times as much as Russian paper. But Rodionov said this could be tough.
""A lock on a door won't stop a cheater,"" he said.

30,"Russia is trying to shift financing of its tarnished gold sector to commercial banks while keeping control of exports, putting it on a collision course with the banks who say sales abroad are what interest them.
Moscow bullion officials view recent Central Bank decisions outlining new procedures for working with gold as a cautious, experimental step toward opening one of the country's most closed industries, the banks say.
""Administrative measures in Russia always mean something,"" said Dmitry Smirnov, head of precious metals operations at Vneshtorgbank, commenting on whether recent changes detailing accounting procedures for working with gold were Soviet-style bureaucratic paper-shuffling or more significant.
But he said: ""Honestly, I wouldn't expect a sharp rise in output any time soon.""
Russian bullion officials say they want to open up the domestic market, since the federal budget can no longer finance gold output or keep the state's strategic reserves well-stocked.
Canadian industry sources say Russia has the world's third-largest untapped gold reserves but is only the world's fifth-largest producer, a fact that reflects the difficulty it is having in channeling funds to mines.
Output in 1995 fell to about 130 tonnes and will slip in 1996 and 1997. About 130 banks have the right to trade in gold domestically but only five to eight can export gold abroad.
Banks financed only five tonnes of output last year.
Western bullion bankers say bank-financed output makes Russia a potential loose cannon on world markets, since it could quickly send output soaring.
Gold, which struck three-year lows earlier this week but has picked up slightly since, hovered around $368 an ounce on Thursday on the London Metal Exchange.
Domestic banks, some of which bought government gold-backed certificates in 1991 which they cashed in for metal, may already have significant stockpiles of gold which they are unable to export due to strict quota and licensing rules.
Boris Yeltsin's press service said on Thursday the president had decreed that Russia would not issue certificates backed by about 30 tonnes of gold as planned last year.
""I know that there are a lot of banks with a lot of gold that they are just waiting to sell abroad,"" said Dmitry Parmeshin, head of Inkombank's precious metals sales section.
""We all want to take this stuff out if the (domestic) market becomes liberalised enough.""
Bankers declined to put a figure on the number of tonnes of gold held in Russian commercial banks, but one said the figure could be at least in the dozens.
The Central Bank in October introduced new accounting procedures for banks seeking to work on the domestic gold market. But the institution still largely controls exports through quotas and licences.
Interfax news agency quoted Central Bank precious metals director Sergei Kyshtymov as saying the rules would soon be simplified further.
""This can be viewed as the first step toward a more open gold market in Russia,"" said Sergei Brazhenko, deputy head of precious metals department at Rossiisky Kredit, one of the few banks with a licence to export gold abroad.
""The task is to hook up our output with world market demand, given that our domestic consumption is low.""
Bullion bankers said domestic consumers bought 15 tonnes of gold last year, mostly as jewellery -- but they said trade restrictions hid the fact that consumer demand was higher.
""Once things become truly liberalised, the domestic market could really explode,"" Parmeshin said.

30,"Russian oil-for-sugar barter deals with Cuba, a staple of trade between the two countries since Soviet times, have soured as market economy principles intrude upon leftover communist-era practices.
Once a swap unencumbered by inconveniences like volatile commodities prices and competitive supplies from other countries, the practice has come up against cold realities that have stalled old deals and raised questions about how new ones will be implemented.
Players on the Russian side said on Wednesday that the last barter arrangement for 1996 had yet to be completed, and that one of the Russian commodities houses implementing the old deal had lost money on it and would likely not do future deals.
""We are not talking now about new deals. No way,"" said a source at Alfa-Eko, which with Menatep-Impex, another Russian powerhouse commodities trader, is implementing the 1996 deal.
The Alfa-Eko source said the only talks taking place were on how to resolve sticky issues left over from the 1996 deal, which has carried into 1997 due to disputes stemming from high world oil prices and low prices for refined sugar in Russia.
He said Alfa-Eko still owed Havana about 200,000 tonnes of oil and was owed about half as much cane sugar.
""The talks are about whether we should go ahead and deliver or just settle the matter amicably,"" he said.
The barter practice goes back to the 1960s, when Soviet Moscow sold cheap oil to Havana, bought a major portion of the Cuban sugar cane crop at wildly-inflated prices, and even picked up Cuba's bad credits when poor harvests sent Havana scrambling onto world markets in search of supplies.
Today, the game is no longer about helping the communist holdout in the Carribean, but about making money.
Havana resells the crude oil on world markets, while Russian sugar refineries get a steady feedstock.
The deals are carried out according to ratios linked to world commodities prices, and private Alfa-Eko and Menatep have replaced the Russian government in carrying out the schemes.
""It's all about the ratios, which are linked to world prices for oil and sugar,"" said a senior Menatep-Impex source, adding that the ratio formulas were a commercial secret.
Menatep said it would complete its portion of the 1996 deal, under which it owes several hundred thousand tonnes of oil and will get about half as much sugar, in the first quarter of 1997.
But it has not been easy.
Cheap Ukrainian refined sugar has flooded into Russia, creating a glut that has pressured prices and forced Alfa-Eko and Menatep to rethink how they can make money on the schemes.
""Honestly, we still have sugar in storage, and the fees are killing us,"" said the Alfa-Eko source. ""We're not doing anything right now -- the market is not favourable.""
The Menatep source said Menatep would do all of the 1997 deals and that Alfa-Eko was quitting the business.
The two sides already have a three-year arrangement covering 1996-1998 that Moscow and Havana signed in 1995. That is in addition to the separate 1996 deal still being carried out.
According to Interfax news agency last year, the three-year deal envisaged Russia selling Cuba 2.1 million tonnes of oil in 1996, 3.9 million in 1997 and 4.5 million in 1998. In return, Russia would get 750,000 tonnes of Cuban raw sugar for 1996, 1.5 million in 1997 and 1.75 million in 1998.
With oil prices at highs and Russian refined sugar prices at lows, the ratios will likely change, leaving somebody in tears.
But even with volatile prices, some things have not changed.
""The deals are still relevant,"" the Menatep source said. ""Russia needs this sugar, which is tough to get in these volumes on the free market, where certain traders have dug in.
""Cubans as trading partners are a very particular type. We're used to them. We've got all sorts of Soviet-era specialists working for us. Alfa-Eko has more of a Western mentality -- and that is why they have lost.""

30,"Russian oil refiners are eyeing costly upgrades to make the lighter products that export markets favour, but they may find it hard to find the cash.
Hydrocrackers and fluid catalytic crackers -- expensive, sophisticated plants that produce lighter material like gasoline, naphtha, diesel and jet fuel -- are rare in Russia, where heavy fuel oil makes up around 40 percent of output.
Most Russian refiners use less sophisticated processing technologies, and only three percent of capacity comes from cracking processes, well below Western levels.
""There's just a screaming need for secondary capacity,"" said a senior Western energy consultant in Moscow. ""But who's willing to invest in a Russian refinery?""
Boston Consulting Group says that by 2000, new capacities in Russia could include 254,000 barrels per day (bpd) of catalytic cracking and 131,000 bpd of hydrocracking, both used to produce expensive, high-octane fuels.
The increases, and boosts to other processes, could bring Russia's products output to 5.9 million bpd by 2000 from a current 5.2 million -- but the analysts said they would not mean heavy product output falls by the wayside.
""You will clearly increase light products capacity, but you also at least maintain the heavy products,"" said Boston Consulting Group Vice-President Charbel Ackermann. ""It's not a substitution or reduction for heavy capacity.""
Oil sources said Russia's 28 major refineries had collectively put in 28 formal requests to international lenders and banks for loans for upgrades -- but money has not flowed in.
""Lots are talking about it, but few are actually doing it,"" said Bechtel International Inc. Vice-President Robert Parker.
In one of many plans dependent on full financing, Russia's Kirishi refinery has said it hopes Chevron will help install a $750 million hydrocracker.
The Yaroslavl refinery, north of Moscow, is getting a $60 million catalytic cracking unit to boost gasoline output, while the Angarsk refinery in Siberia is working with M. W. Kellogg on a $70 million plan for a fluid catalytic cracking unit.
The Fuel and Energy Ministry said the Omsk refinery, in Siberia, would get a catalytic reforming plant by 2000, and that ABB Lummus Global was working on plans to help the Perm, Samara, Angarsk and other refineries install catalytic crackers.
Rif Usmanov, chief engineer at the Ufa refinery in southern Russia, said the plant's catalytic cracking facility, completed in March, would produce two million tonnes of gasoline and diesel a year (about 40,000 bpd).
An engineer at the Ryazan refinery south of Moscow said revamping of a catalytic cracking unit to raise capacity to 24,000 bpd would continue into 1997.
""A lot of projects are merely adjusting the heights of the columns and tinkering with other things,"" said energy specialist Peter Houlder at CentreInvest consultancy in Moscow. ""But most of these are not $200-$300 million projects.""
Some question the timing of the proposed upgrades, saying transport costs to Europe will squeeze margins too much.
""A lot of ambition is geared on the basis of exporting product to Europe, which I don't think is that logical,"" Parker said. ""Continental Europe is surrounded by state-of-the-art, high-tech refineries and sophisticated distribution.""
But the economy in Russia's Volga and Urals regions, where heavy industry is in steep decline, is not picking up quickly and may not be able to absorb new products output soon.
""With the domestic market's limited absorption capacity, you'll still see an inclination to export heavy,"" Ackermann said.

30,"Russian natural gas giant Gazprom announced restructuring and cost-cutting plans on Tuesday, but the world's biggest gas producer downplayed discord with the government over its fate and said it would stay intact.
Gazprom board chairman Rem Vyakhirev said the company -- one of Russia's most powerful entities but increasingly under government scrutiny -- had mostly resolved a row with ministries and property officials over restructuring.
He told a news conference the firm would shed 100,000 jobs this year -- a massive 26 percent of the workforce.
But Vyakhirev said Gazprom would remain a monopoly and would not be split up.
""All of the internal blocs will remain within the Gazprom organisation,"" he said, referring to internal restructuring which would create up to half a dozen units within the monopoly for output, marketing, transport, finance and other issues.
Gazprom is one of Russia's most politically influential and well-connected companies, but it has come under attack by the International Monetary Fund and some government officials over its opaque financial books and strict control over access to its pipelines.
But Vyakhirev sought to paint a picture of accord between Gazprom and the government, whose prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, once headed Gazprom but who has been conspicuously absent from recent public debate over the company's fate.
He said that he, First Deputy Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov and Chernomrydin were all carrying out state duties in examining Gazprom activities.
""I think all four of us will reach agreement. I have a creed -- Russia and Gazprom are family. There will be no quarrels.""
Vyakhirev, displaying none of the fear other executives show at the prospect of shedding jobs, said the leaner workforce would save Gazprom three trillion roubles ($520 million) a year.
Russia accounts for 34 percent of world gas reserves and 27 percent of output; Gazprom produces nearly all of Russia's gas.
Analysts say that the company, which was once an entire ministry, is immensely rich from exports -- heating about one third of Europe -- but that it faces serious problems in collecting debts in the former Soviet Union for unpaid supplies.
Even the profit figures are open to doubt.
""When we worked with our auditors (Price Waterhouse), we saw our profits weren't accurately reflected, that our expenditures didn't always have something to do with output,"" Vyakhirev said.
""There are many unnecessary expenditures. We're cleaning out all our basic production spheres -- that means getting rid of anything that we don't need.""
But he said Gazprom was rich enough to pay seven trillion roubles ($1.2 billion) to state coffers by June 10 to help President Boris Yeltsin meet a promise to pay pension arrears.
Nemtsov has put Gazprom's debts to the federal budget at a whopping 14.8 trillion roubles ($2.6 billion), while Gazprom says it is owed a dizzying 64 trillion roubles ($11.2 billion).
The state has a 40 percent stake in Gazprom, seven eighths of it personally managed in trust by Vyakhirev. Last week, after a row between Vyakhirev and ministers, Privatisation Minister Alfred Kokh said the government would review the arrangement.
Government officials said this week they had lost the document outlining the deal. Vyakhirev said they later found it and that the scheme would stay, but with some changes.
Nemtsov, a reformer entrusted with restructuring Russia's natural monopolies, including Gazprom, has long said the monopoly will not be broken up into separate output and transport companies. ""Only a nut would destroy Gazprom,"" Nemtsov was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.
The company operates a strict separation between its domestically-traded shares and those covered by its ADSs in London.
Gazprom was trading at $0.665 on the Russian Trading System at 1230 GMT versus $0.620 on Monday. The ADSs, covering 10 underlying shares, were at $16.45 in London versus Monday's close of $16.30.

30,"Russia will be a big buyer of Iraqi oil once again as Baghdad gears up to export more crude to raise much-needed cash for food and medicine, Russian officials said on Thursday.
""We're aiming for as much this time as we had last time,"" said Yuri Agababov, deputy general director of Zarubezhneft, the Moscow-based firm coordinating Russian contracts for Iraqi oil under the United Nation's oil-for-food deal.
The United Nations renewed a $2 billion, 180-day programme on Wednesday under which Iraq will export oil to raise cash for humanitarian needs and to pay reparations to Gulf War victims after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Russian companies bought nearly 28.54 billion barrels of Iraqi oil under the first 180-day programme, or a whopping 23.4 percent of the 121.6 million or so barrels Baghdad was permitted to export under that first deal.
""We're hoping to do this much again,"" Agababov said in a brief telephone interview. ""But it will all depend on how the commercial terms of our talks proceed. Let's not jinx it by talking about it before it happens.""
The U.N. resolution renews the programme from June 8, right after the first deal expires, and Agababov said he would head a delegation of Russian companies to Baghdad next week to begin negotiating contracts with Iraqi state oil firm SOMO.
He said talks had not yet taken place and declined to say whether contracts had been pre-negotiated in principle.
""Those firms which participated will do so again, and there may be some new players,"" Agababov said, adding that Russian companies lifted their last loading of crude on May 22-25.
Russia has an inside track to Iraq, its Soviet-era trading partner and geopolitical ally, and is keen to see Baghdad flush with cash to repay the $7 billion it owes Moscow.
Russia's -- and one of the world's -- largest oil companies, LUKoil, has a 52.5 percent stake in a $4 billion, 23-year production-sharing project in Iraq's Western Qurnah oil field.
Other Russian firms, including Mashinoimport, have supplied Baghdad with oil equipment, and organisations close to the Foreign Trade Ministry sent wheat, sugar, vegetable oils and other foodstuffs.
But Agababov said commerce, not politics, was at work in the oil-for-food deal. ""We'll participate on the same level and terms as others,"" he said. ""It all comes down to the terms of the contracts.""
He declined to say how the terms had been attractive to the eight Russian oil-producing and trading companies which had contracts under the first deal.
Benchmark Brent Blend's nearby contract, a benchmark for valueing Iraq's exports and thus their quantity, was around $18.74 a barrel in early London futures trade.
That was more than $5.00 below the December 10, 1996 nearby-contract level when Iraq first returned to world oil markets under the first U.N. programme.
But Russian traders, who are finding it tougher to win access to tight domestic export pipelines, are keen to get their hands on any oil they can.
Vladimir Bjedougov, deputy head of major trader Alfa-Eko's international section, which had a big contract under the first programme, said lifters had taken a hit from what he called the failure of the U.N.-Iraqi price formula to reflect the market.
""Prices fluctuated fairly sharply for a while and the formula didn't reflect the difference -- but I wouldn't say this experience would have any effect on our next talks,"" he said.
""On the contrary, it will make things easier. The first contract went well, even though in any deal, there are always technical problems -- but none of them were critical.""

30,"Crude oil output in Russia, the world's third-largest oil producer, is finally ending a decade of dramatic decline, but it is still a long way from switching back into top gear.
""We could see 1997 output stabilise at 1996's level,"" said Vitaly Kamenev of the Economy Ministry's fuel department. ""But we won't see any real pick-up until at least 1998.""
Russian oil output slipped two percent year-on-year to 146 million tonnes in the first half of 1996, after falling three percent in the first half of 1994, according to the State Statistics Committee. Most of the decline came from companies producing over 10 million tonnes a year.
""It is the ministry's opinion that output will fall two or three percent next year,"" said a Fuel and Energy Ministry source who declined to be named, saying that the matter was sensitive.
That would still be one of the lowest declines Russia's beleaguered oil industry has seen in recent years.
It would also be a sign that the era of steep plunges is finally drawing to a close.
Russia's 1995 output of 305 million tonnes, or 6.2 million barrels per day, is stabilising at just over half of 1987's peak of 570 million tonnes (11.4 million bpd).
The numbers matter because they indicate the pace at which Russia, once the world's largest oil producer, may regain that place as its economy and domestic oil prices grow.
But it is still early.
""There are a lot of expectations that the barrier will be broken next year, but it won't -- output will be flat,"" said Tamara Okhundova, energy analyst at the Centre for Economic Trends, a research institute set up by the government.
Moscow is for now committed to subsidising domestic oil prices to help flagging industrial enterprises, and export levels cannot rise significantly until new pipelines are built -- two key factors that do not inspire higher production levels.
""Production next year is going to be pretty flat, and if anything, slightly lower,"" said energy analyst Jeremy Hudson of Salomon Brothers in London.
He said that if parliament soon approved a list of reserves open to production-sharing, an initial, positive impact on output could be felt by the end of 1997.
Russia's joint ventures, which account for less than five percent of production, are showing the biggest increases in output, with their production up 18 percent in the first half 1996 to seven million tonnes.
When the big-ticket joint ventures and production-sharing deals begin producing in several years, total output could soar.
A bull-run in world prices and Moscow's scrapped export duties have inspired Russian producers to put even more oil into already over-strapped export pipelines.
But a tax clampdown on high foreign-exchange earners and a lack of commitment by new shareholders in Russian oil companies to reinvest in production are both sucking up cash.
Julian Leigh, Russia analyst at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London, said higher export dollars were not necessarily finding their way back into production.
He said domestic commercial banks, some of which are major stockholders in big Russian oil companies, preferred to pump cash into markets with better returns, like equity.
Rehabilitating wells is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to boost output, but most of the easy, less expensive workovers have been completed and average well production rates have not been as high as expected.
Russia has 144,000 oil wells, of which nearly 40,000, or 28 percent, are idle. Hudson said average workover rates -- the cost of bringing these back on stream -- could rise to $100,000 per well from $25,000.

30,"Russian demand for imported sugar has picked up earlier than usual on the eve of the beet harvest, and traders said less price volatility and more consolidation were adding stability to the domestic market.
""Demand is normal, prices are stabilising,"" said a senior trade source. ""There's sugar coming into the ports and demand is good.""
He said raws would need to arrive by mid-July to be processed at domestic refineries before the Russian beet crop supplanted them as a feedstock.
""The (Russian) market is strong at the moment,"" said a second senior trade source. ""You are seeing demand for sugar at the moment. There is some pretty intensive importing of raws right now -- the price structures make tolling profitable.""
Traders debated market talk of sugar backlogs at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk and whether Russia could soak up any unplaced cargoes looking for homes.
""If you have raws arriving in the Black Sea in July, you'll be pressed,"" said the first source, adding that refineries needed 14-21 days for processing and that they would be less keen to contract for raws as the beet harvest approached.
Recent market talk that around 250,000 tonnes of raws, possibly Brazilian, could be expected later this summer in Novorossiisk or the Baltics was still speculative, traders said.
A Novorossiisk port source said that a backlog of Cuban raws at the outlet had edged down only slightly to 80,700 tonnes from around 90,000 tonnes last week because the Russian receiver was not ready to take delivery.
He said the port expected to receive around 200,000 tonnes of raws, probably of Cuban origin, this summer, including 70,000 tonnes of unknown origin before June.
Indian refined white sugar stocks in port warehouses were around 400,000 tonnes, the port source said, but the senior trade sources said it was overblown by a factor of ten or more.
Russia is heading into its traditional jam-making season, a major factor that spurs a rise in refined sugar imports.
""People are preempting a little, because demand doesn't normally pick up until end-June,"" said the first trade source, adding, ""the high-quality sugar market is much stronger -- you're seeing significant demand, especially at the Western (beverage) bottlers (with Russia operations).""
Sources said domestic sugar reserves were being drawn down but that a fundamental, long-term pick-up in consumer demand had yet to materialise. Some traders see Russian demand as fairly price inelastic and relatively steady despite economic decline and tight disposable income.
Russian consumption is about five million tonnes a year.
There is less room for European sugar in Russia, which meets most of its needs by importing whites from Ukraine and refining Cuban raws and its own sugar beets.
But the structure of the Russian market is changing.
""The market is consolidating -- it's a natural market development,"" said the first source, adding that the days of suppliers having to leap over three or four middlemen to get to buyers were gone.
""You're getting directly at the refiners, and you're cutting out the wild (price) swings,"" he said.
A big glut in 1995, in which buyers imported too much and demand failed to take off as hoped, forced changes in distribution networks that were now consolidating the market.
""The domestic market will remain strong but it won't go crazy,"" said the first trader. ""But hopefully this will establish a pattern.""

30,"Russian cocoa importers hope business will be sweeter this year, but increasing competition from Western chocolate bars and a lack of precise data on buying patterns have clouded the market, trade sources said on Monday.
""The general tendency is one of growth -- we'll be buying more cocoa this year,"" said Yuri Granilin, supplies director at the large Babayevsky confectionery plant in Moscow. He declined to give figures.
Domestic producers are competing against a flood of Western ready-made chocolates, with the latter in an upward trend as domestic firms struggle to find recipes for success in a market economy.
The State Statistics Committee said imports of cocoa from outside the Commonwealth of Independent States edged higher to 47,700 tonnes in the first eleven months of 1996 from 47,000 tonnes over the same 1995 period.
The International Cocoa Organisation puts Russian grindings over 1995/96 flat at 75,000 tonnes for the third marketing year in a row.
One Nestle source said Russia's ready-made chocolate products market would grow 15-20 percent this year but that overall growth in cocoa imports was unlikely.
Alexander Pavlov, head of the Agriculture Ministry's food industry department, said Russia's 1996 imports of cocoa and cocoa derivatives slipped eight percent year-on-year.
""I don't think we'll see much growth this year,"" he said, putting imports of cocoa beans, liquor, powder, butter, grated chocolate and semi-fabricated whole cocoa bars at 130,000 tonnes, including about 75,000 tonnes of beans.
But he cautioned that figures were difficult to pin down, since some imports do not show up in the official statistics and producers had stocks left over from 1995.
Pavlov estimated that imported ready-made chocolate products comprise 10-15 percent of the domestic market for such goods.
Companies like Nestle SA, Switzerland's Andre et Cie, Cargill Inc of the United States and E.D. &amp; F. Man International Inc are suppliers to Russian confectionery plants, which now buy direct instead of going through the Soviet-era agencies that bought about 100,000 tonnes of beans a year.
""The Russian market is quite different from the U.S. and European ones,"" said a senior source at a major Western confectionery. ""It's a question of taste,"" the source said, adding that three times as many Russians prefer dark chocolates to those who prefer milk chocolates.
Individual chocolate bars are a relative novelty in Russia and are having to work hard to compete with the traditional large, block chocolates, wafers and biscuits Russians love.
One source guessed the size of the bar market at 100,000 tonnes a year, but cautioned this was a rough estimate.
The market for chocolate-covered wafers and biscuits could be three times higher, while the market for small chocolate candies was possibly four times greater, the source said.
Bars, packaged for on-the-go consumption, are a relative novelty to Russians, who traditionally treat chocolate as a treat to be consumed at home or on special occasions.
""Russians are into plain chocolate; these fillings, nuts and souffles the Europeans love aren't our tradition,"" Pavlov said.
Moscow grocery stores are filled with imported and domestic chocolates, but the abundance does not extend to the rest of this vast country to the same extent.
Trade sources said the Russian market was in such a state of change that Western confectioners were keener to launch new brands rather than increase an existing brand's market share.
""Everything is changing really quickly,"" said one source.

30,"Russia's plans to cut electricity tariffs for good payers could jolt its giant aluminium industry, the world's largest exporter of the non-ferrous metal, into bigger profits, officials and analysts said on Monday.
But not all plants, they said, would benefit equally.
""Well, this is certainly a pretty good development,"" said Galina Stelmakova, deputy director for development and investments at Kontsern Alyuminiy, the Russian producers' group. ""It will streamline the economic situations at smelters.
Fuel and Energy Minister Boris Nemtsov, in charge of revamping natural monopolies in the energy and transport sectors, said earlier that electricity tariffs for domestic industry would drop by up to 30 percent from July.
Nemtsov said only users which paid on time for supplies would be eligible for the lower tariffs -- a condition many, but not all, Russian smelters meet.
Industry officials said that with electricity accounting for about 25 percent of the cost of producing a tonne of primary aluminium in Russia, lower power tariffs could help profits.
Yuri Shlaifshtein, a board member at Bratsk, the world's largest primary aluminium smelter, said leaner tariffs could help the Siberian plant's longterm plans to attract foreign investment for modernisation.
""I can only welcome this decision,"" he said by telephone, adding Bratsk always paid on time, in cash, for its electricity supplies. ""This won't affect our general production levels but it will make them more stable over the longterm.""
Russia, home to the world's largest smelters, exported 2.44 million tonnes of primary aluminium last year, the most of any producing country. Its total output was 2.87 million tonnes.
The reduction in power costs are not likely to be felt evenly, since different regions have different rates. The so-called European part of Russia, where only about 15 percent of Russia's aluminium is produced, pays the highest tariffs.
Irkutsk, another large East Siberian smelter, pays about 10 percent of its per-tonne production cost of $1,200 for electricity. In sharp contrast, the European smelters pay up to $600 for electricity for each tonne.
Boris Arlyuk of St Petersburg, Russia-based Alumconsult said the rate cuts would help the Kandalaksha, Nadvoisky and Volgograd smelters in the European part of Russia most of all, since those plants had the highest energy costs.
But they were also the least solvent, paying for electricity with metal or promissory notes, and might not be able to produce cash up front as Nemtsov wanted, he said.
Russian smelters are struggling to secure longterm electricity supply contracts to increase profits and plan for the future.
Nemstov's rate cuts are part of a wider drive by Moscow to spark life into industrial output in general, which has plummeted in the years since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Ironically, electricity rate cuts could benefit the Siberian smelters the least, since some of them may have already secured longterm supply contracts with regional hydroelectrical plants.
""Now if we can just get the government to agree to a lower tariff for three years,"" Shlaifshtein added. ""And then get it to do the same thing for railway tariffs.""
Nemtsov, a young reformer who is also a first deputy prime minister, has also promised to cut rail tariffs -- a move the smelters would welcome.
Industry officials have said the cost of transporting Russian metal to world markets is more than twice the Western industry average of around 24 percent.
Kontsern Alyuminiy said in March that average Russian smelter profit margins had fallen to one percent in 1996 from 16 percent two years before.

12,"International Business Machines Corp. is expected to report solid fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, but analysts expect the stronger dollar will hurt the computer giant's profits.
The Armonk, N.Y.-based company will report earnings after the stock market closes, the first time it has done so in recent memory.
Wall Street analysts are predicting earnings of $3.13 a share to $4.32 per share, with a consensus of $3.88 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst estimates.
A year ago, IBM earned $3.09 a share, or $1.7 billiion, including special charges, in the fourth quarter.
""I think it will be a good quarter,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich.
""I'm not looking for a blowout quarter,"" Milunovich said, adding that the dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter and that IBM could see as much as a 25-cent-per-share negative impact on earnings from currency fluctuations.
The earnings report comes amid mixed results from the computer industry for what is traditionally its biggest quarter of the year.
Apple Computer Inc. reported a bigger-than-expected loss, but Sun Microsystems Inc. had stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings and Digital Equipment Corp. reported a slightly better-than-expected profit in its second quarter.
Analysts also expect IBM to report bigger expenses in the fourth quarter for its restructuring, which it no longer writes off as a charge. In the third quarter, IBM had restructuring costs of about $200 million for employee buyouts.
""They will have an expense for restructuring, and it could be twice as much as the September quarter,"" said Dean Witter analyst Jay Stevens.
Analysts said IBM's employees in Europe have been much slower to accept its buyout plans. John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst, predicts IBM will have costs of about $700 million in 1997 for organisational changes in Europe.
""Europe remains a slow grower, which has led to a number of organisational and planned efficiency changes, which we expect will require over $700 million in 1997,"" Jones said in a report. He said these expenses are included in his 1997 earnings estimate of $11.20 a share.
For 1996, analysts expect IBM to earn between $10.30 to $11.50 a share, with a consensus of $11.05, according to First Call.
Analysts said sales of IBM's midrange computers, the AS/400, should post growth of about 10 percent and that there should be a big improvement in RS/6000 workstations.
IBM will host its quarterly analyst meeting and conference call sometime after its earnings are released late Tuesday.
Analysts said the company was releasing its earnings after the close to avoid the recent volatility in its stock -- which has climbed or fallen as much as $10 on the days it reports earnings -- during its conference call with analysts.
IBM stock was down $1 at $164.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

12,"A top executive at Compaq Computer Corp. said Thursday he was leaving the world's biggest personal computer maker and joining an Internet startup, giving credibility to the startup and setting in motion a realignment of Compaq's sales managers.
The executive, Ross Cooley, is leaving a position where he was in charge of Compaq's $7 billion North American computer business for a job at a four-month-old company with the high-tech name of pcOrder.com
At pcOrder.com, Cooley, 55, will fill the as-yet unfilled positions of chairman and chief executive officer and have a salary of $1 a year, plus stock options.
His move from an executive suite at a Fortune 500 company to a technology startup mirrors that of several other executives over the past few years, notably, the departure of Alex Mandl from AT&amp;T earlier this year.
Cooley's move provides instant credibility to pcOrder.com, which provides a marketplace on the Internet for buying and selling personal computers and related equipment.
Cooley's retirement had been rumored in the industry for several months, and Compaq announced that James Schraith, formerly president of The Cerplex Group Inc. and president of AST Research Inc., is replacing Cooley.
""Ross's plan to retire has been in discussion for awhile and there were some rumors flying,"" Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and CEO of Compaq, said in an interview. ""The time has come and obviously as you can see the succession is already in place ... Ross has been a great leader.""
At the same time, Compaq created a new sales infrastructure, hiring Richard Snyder, a Dell Computer Corp. executive, for a newly-created position of general manager, worldwide sales. All the heads of Compaq's five geographical sales regions -- Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Japan, Latin America and North America -- will report to him.
Previously, these regions all reported directly to Pfeiffer. But as Compaq has quickly grown to an almost $18 billion company in recent years, Pfeiffer said he needs another executive to stay in touch with the day-to-day activities of its worldwide sales and support organization.
""Fifteen people have been reporting to me up until this morning when we announced this change,"" Pfeiffer said. ""That is a huge top management organization. As the company grows, my tasks change.""
Compaq has grown from its origins as one of the first companies to successfully clone the IBM PC in the early 1980s to become the leading PC maker in the world. Cooley is known for his strong relationships with the PC sales channel and his role in building Compaq's massive distribution.
""My feelings in joining pcOrder are similar to those I had in joining Compaq almost 13 years ago,"" Cooley said in a statement. ""Back then, I saw the irrefutable logic of the PC as a new paradigm in computing. Today, I believe pcOrder's technology and vision represent an irrefutable value proposition.""
Before joining Compaq in 1984, Cooley held several sales and marketing positions at International Business Machines Corp., where he worked for 18 years.
""Getting Cooley is really a coup for pcOrder,"" said John McCarthy, a Forrester Research analyst, adding that Cooley's connections in PC distrubution will give pcOrder more credibility as it builds its system. Cooley's acceptance of $1 a year for salary, plus stock options, is also a ""big bet on the company's upside (potential),"" McCarthy said.
pcOrder for now is still private, but the company is contemplating a public offering eventually.
""We do not have a set plan or a set timetable, but we are seriously considering it,"" said founder and President Christina Jones. Jones will continue as president of pcOrder. The post of chairman and CEO had been vacant since the start-up was founded in June.
pcOrder.com is a marketplace on the Internet, where PC makers, components makers and distributors list information and receive orders.
Currently, sales representatives and customers user pcOrder to configure build-to-order PCs, compare prices, and place orders over the Internet. The system contains information on over 150,000 products in the PC industry from over 800 manufacturers.

12,"After two years of hype and euphoria about the Internet and its sweeping impact on the computer industry, a reality check is setting in as investors are asking: Where's the money?
A Tucson, Ariz., industry conference this week called PC Forum -- a ""schmooze fest"" once populated mostly by the upper echelon of the computer industry -- brought together telecommunications and media company leaders as well as those from computer behemoths and start-ups.
Many attendees said there is more concern now about profits and business models.
""It's now coming to practical terms,"" said Ed Bennett, former president of the Prodigy Services online service. ""Where is the money coming from? ... But the raw potential of the industry hasn't changed, and that's a good thing.""
So far, it is still not clear what type of business plan will lead to hefty revenues and profits from the Internet, whether it be advertising-based, subscription-based or some other way of making money.
Recent failures or financial problems at Web-based ventures, such as the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of American Cybercast, one of the first Web soap opera sites, are causing concern.
Executives also pointed to the recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Amazon.com, which pioneered bookselling on the Internet, for its anticipated initial public offering (IPO).
Seattle-based Amazon.com, known as one of the most successful ventures and best-known examples of Internet commerce, said it lost $5.8 million in 1996, mostly due to increased investments in technology and marketing.
""There is no question that there is an increased focus on the part of analysts and investors on when are they going to make money,"" said Sheldon Laube, chief technology officer of U.S. Web., a privately held Santa Clara, Calif. company which franchises Web development, training and consulting services.
""It's a healthy part of the evolution of the business,"" Laube said. ""The hype is now evolving into reality and ultimately that is what technology is all about.""
While the conference is a forum for discussing industry issues and exchanging ideas -- sometimes lofty and intellectual ones such as the use of metaphors and language to describe this new medium -- a number of small start-up companies come to make their debut before their peers. Industry executives, analysts and investors come to meet and make deals in the hallways.
This year, in the so-called ""debutantes"" presentations, many venture capitalists, Wall Street analysts and fund managers checked out 12 early start-ups.
The PC Forum, run by industry guru Esther Dyson, is considered such an important part of a start-up company's debut that Fast Company magazine followed around executives of two small companies to chronicle their participation at the conference.
""This is the 'Lollapalooza' of the Internet,"" Bennett said, who remains on Prodigy's board, referring to the alternative music festival. ""Not every band is going to get signed.""
This year, questions about business models dominated many start-up presentations more than the technology. During a presentation by a start-up called NetBot Inc., whose Internet ""shopping assistant"" made its debut, one attendee interrupted to ask about the Seattle-based firm's business model, even before the company demonstrated its software called Jango.
""People are much more pragmatic when they look at these companies,"" said Bruce Smith, a Merrill Lynch Internet analyst. ""You like to look at companies that have thought through their business model and how they will compete with the 800-pound gorilla (Microsoft Corp.).""
And as the stocks of other publicly traded companies such as Internet search engines firms like Yahoo! Inc., Excite Inc., and Lycos Inc. ; Internet access providers; online services and other Internet software companies continue to drop on Wall Street, start-ups compete for fewer and fewer venture capital dollars.
Some promising IPO candidates are also mulling being acquired, such as PointCast Inc.'s much-rumoured discussions two weeks ago to be acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the owner of the Fox television network and newspapers such as the New York Post.
PointCast, a pioneer in so-called push technology, said last week its present intention was to remain independent.
""In the venture capital business, you can see the transition from a seller's market to a buyer's market,"" said Roger McNamee, general partner at Integral Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. ""Entrepreneurs are beginning to wonder where their next dollar of capital will come from.""
Even in its new-found pragmatism, the industry remains ever optimistic about the future. Conference leader Dyson and many of the speakers gathered together at the end of the conference with the creator of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, who now heads up the World Wide Web Consortium.
""The competition is what produces the incredible rate of development,"" Berners-Lee said.

12,"International Business Machines Corp. said Wednesday it agreed to buy Edmark Corp., a publisher of children's education software, for $80 million in cash in a move to focus its consumer business on learning at home.
The world's largest computer maker said it would launch a tender offer for all of Edmark at $15.50 a share. The company, based in Redmond, Wash., where software giant Microsoft Corp. is based, makes software aimed at students in kindergarten through 12th grade.
Analysts said the move will strengthen IBM's effort to market personal computers and software to consumers.
""Edmark has some very valuable properties. This acquisition should be seen as one in a series of major moves that will help IBM achieve some of its goals in the consumer market,"" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, director of consumer research at International Data Corp., a market research firm.
Analysts said many of Edmark's titles, including its newly released Mighty Math Series, Stanley's Stickers Stories and its Thinkin' Things Series, were gaining popularity.
Some of IBM's consumer software titles, such as its recent CD-ROM based on the Pinnochio movie, and other CD-ROMS with movie tie-ins, have not fared well.
""They have had mixed results,"" Zwetchkenbaum said, referring to IBM.
The deal will also give Edmark access to IBM's worldwide distribution network, which it needs to compete in the cut-throat consumer retail market, where the fight for shelf space can sometimes make or break a software company.
Following the news, Edmark's stock jumped $3.8125 to $15.25 on Nasdaq and IBM rose $1.50 to $134.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
IBM said the directors and executive officers of Edmark have agreed to sell their shares.
IBM said it plans to operate the unit under the Edmark name in Redmond, with Jim Firestone, the head of its consumer business, overseeing and directing operations. Edmark will be the core of its plans to focus more on educational computers.
""This gives us a very strong foundation,"" said Firestone, general manager, IBM Consumer Division, in an interview. ""We are working with a handful of other firms, but I expect Edmark to be the real core of this activity. It is a base upon which we expect to grow.""
Firestone, formerly an American Express Co. executive, was named to head IBM's newly created consumer business in July 1995. He faced the daunting task of overhauling IBM's previous forays into the home PC market, which have not gone well. Nor is it well known for its consumer software.
As part of refocusing IBM in the consumer arena, Firestone said IBM will only choose a few places to compete, and one of those areas will be the family educational market.
""I am not interested in the entertainment side of consumer software,"" Firestone said. He also said IBM's latest Aptiva home PC models introduced in September were gaining market share. The machines are being marketed as a family learning tool and Edmark software will fit with that focus.
Analysts also said more deals in educational software could be coming since stock prices have fallen. Edmark's shares have traded as as $43.50.
The low price that IBM paid for Edmark, ""reflects the distress of the industry,"" said Scott McAdams, of Ragen Mackenzie. ""The whole sector's fortunes have changed.""

12,"International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday introduced its next generation mainframe computer family, with systems twice as fast as currently available models, in a product launch widely anticipated by its customers.
""The feedback is phenomenal,"" said Ross Mauri, vice president of System 390 hardware developnment, in a phone interview. ""We have seen quite a bit of demand out there.""
""Customers have been enthusiastic about embracing the new server,"" Mauri said, adding that it is likely that IBM will be ""sold out of what we can produce this year,"" based on the initial customer reaction.
Mainframes are giant computers that store the data of the biggest corporations around the world. They are used by banks for transactions, by airlines for reservations systems, and by insurance companies for claims processing.
While many analysts have predicted the demise of these giant computers as more companies move to PC-based networks, mainframes have staged somewhat of a comeback as huge repositories of data that is accessible via the Internet and internal networks known as intranets.
The new mainframe servers use the third generation of IBM's lower-cost processor technology, called CMOS. The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology is a process that uses microprocessor technology that is less costly to build and less expensive for customers to maintain.
IBM introduced two new lines of System 390 servers, or computers that manage networks.
One family, called the IBM S/390 Parallel Entreprise Server, has 13 models designed specifically for heavy data storage and for transaction intensive companies.
The second server line, the IBM S/390 Multiprise 2000, is aimed at medium-sized customers who are currently using IBM S/390 mainframes, but wish to increase their computing power. The Multiprise is also aimed at customers who wish to buy an entire package, with software and storage systems.
So far, IBM has installed about 14 of the S/390 Parallel Enterprise Servers - Generation 3 in an early customer programme. IBM has also installed three of the S/390 Multiprise.
IBM also said it introduced an upgrade of its mainframe operating system, called OS/390 Release 2, which provides more connectivity for customers to computer networks such as the Internet and UNIX based systems. IBM also introduced other software products for better network computing over the S/390.
IBM also introduced new mainframe disk storage products for improved data reliabilty.
IBM declined to give any price details on the new models, saying that it tailors each systems to unique customer needs and that customers are now familiar with the lower prices of CMOS-based mainframes.
""As you make the transition from bipolar to CMOS, you see a significant price reduction,"" said Mauri. ""Customers already have an understanding of that.""
Bipolar refers to the process technology that IBM used in its older mainframe models. Three years ago, IBM began preparing its customers for a big transition to a new, lower-cost machine, designed around microprocessors.
Analysts said the new mainframes run at speeds of around 45 million instructions per second (MIPS), twice as fast as the currently available speeds of 22 million instructions per second for the fastest CMOS models, bringing the systems up to the speeds of the older bipolar machines, and at a lower cost.
Even with the prices of these huge milllion dollar systems falling, mainframes are still IBM's biggest revenue producing hardware. Analysts are hoping for a big uptick in fourth quarter earnings, in part due to mainframes, because the lower-cost models are more profitable to IBM.
""These are all necessary announcements for IBM,"" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst, adding that the products are important to IBM's future earnings.
IBM said the new models will be available next month.
""The mainframe as we once knew it, where MIPS were expensive, we are never going to see that again,"" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. ""IBM has re-engineered the mainframe, they don't even want to call it a mainframe anymore, they call it a server.""

12,"Progressive Networks Inc., whose RealAudio software has become a popular way to listen to music on the Internet, Monday unveiled RealVideo, which adds sights to the sounds, and announced support from major entertainment and media companies.
RealVideo became available for free, beginning Monday, by downloading Progressive Networks' RealPlayer software from its Web site (http://www.realaudio.com). A more fully featured version can be purchased from the site for $29.99.
RealVideo delivers live, on-demand video over the Internet and the corporate, Internet-like networks known as intranets.
Privately held, Seattle-based Progressive Networks said it believed that RealVideo will do for video on the Internet what RealAudio did for audio.
Lining up to support the new software were more than 50 entertainment, media and computer companies, including Walt Disney Co.'s ABC, Time Warner Inc., Cable News Network, News Corp.'s Fox News and MSNBC, the cable TV and Web site venture of Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co.'s NBC.
The news conference held to announce the software included an appearance by film director Spike Lee, who premiered three short films developed using RealVideo.
One of the films, which last three to five minutes and can be viewed from Progressive Network's Web site, features dancer Savion Glover of the Broadway show ""Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk"" talking about tap dancing and showing his 13 pairs of tap dancing shoes.
The RealPlayer software also will include RealAudio version 3.0. There are now more than 10 million users of RealAudio, the company estimates.
Progressive Networks said it planned to make money by selling the software to content developers that will use the software to transmit video over the Internet.
Video over the Internet has been problematic because of the lack of bandwidth -- that is, a data ""pipeline"" big enough to handle the relatively large amount of information video involves. Video over the Internet still resides on only a small part of the computer screen, with some jerkiness and at a slower rate than full-motion video.
""We are boldly going where we haven't gone before,"" Progressive Networks Chief Executive Officer Rob Glaser said in an interview.
The RealPlayer is designed to run on PCs with an Intel Corp. Pentium processor at speeds of 75 megahertz and above and using Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 or NT.
One content developer who is using the software said his firm has embraced RealVideo because it believes it will become the de facto standard in Internet video, in the same manner that RealAudio has become the audio standard.
""It gives us another tool we can use,"" said Ken Locker, an executive producer at MGM Interactive. ""But the Internet is not television. When I say video, it's not even full-motion video, which is 30 frames per second.""
Locker said RealVideo averages about seven to 12 frames per second. ""It works very well and Progressive Networks is positioned to make theirs the standard.""
RealVideo works by sending packets of video in a stream from a server, or network computer. If a personal computer receives only 90 percent of the packets, it sends a message back to the server asking for a retransmission.
The process, called video streaming, is not new and has been available on the Internet from companies such as privately held VXtreme and VDONet. But analysts said that, because of RealAudio's widespread adoption, they expect RealVideo to dominate.
""They have a reputation with over 40,000 content developers, which use RealAudio-equipped servers,"" said Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul Kagan &amp; Associates, in Carmel, Calif.

12,"Former NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff Monday was named chairman of the board of America Online Inc.'s original content developer, Greenhouse Networks, as part of a major initiative to create specialized online networks. The company's stock soared.
The world's No. 1 online service also said it was buying LightSpeed Media Inc., a pioneer producer of Internet soap operas and shows. Financial terms were not disclosed.
As part of the deal, Vienna, Va.-based Greenhouse Networks said it would develop an interactive entertainment network, slated for launch this fall on AOL and the Internet.
America Online stock rose $5, or more than 11 percent, to $47 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was seventh leading percentage gainer for the day.
AOL's entertainment network will be based in Los Angeles and will capitalize on Lightspeed's and Tartikoff's relationships in the entertainment industry.
America Online's deal with Tartikoff expands a previous arrangement announced last fall for the executive to develop original interactive brands to be launched simultaneously online, on television and as books.
Tartikoff, who was president of NBC Entertainment from 1980 to 1991, currently heads his own television and production company, H. Beale Co., in Los Angeles. During his tenure at NBC, the network made its rise to the No. 1 network with shows such as ""Hill Street Blues,"" ""Cheers,"" ""L.A. Law,"" and ""Family Ties.""
From 1991 to 1992, he was chairman of Paramount Pictures when that studio released hit movies such as ""Wayne's World"" and ""Patriot Games.""
Analysts called the expansion of Tartikoff's role a ""major coup"" for the online service, as it hopes to move toward developing its own content instead of just investing in companies that develop content for AOL.
The Greenhouse Network's Motley Fool personal finance area is one of the most successful of the over 30 Greenhouse investments. The founders of Motley Fool have authored books, articles and the Motley Fool is now a logo found on baseball hats, T-shirts and other merchandise.
Tartikoff ""developed NBC into the powerhouse of the 1980s,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with Arlen Communications Inc. in Bethesda, Md. ""He has these concepts and he gets them down. ... They are hoping to get a major hit that is so big they will be able to merchandise it.""
Tartikoff's first project with Greenhouse and AOL will be called ""Beggars and Choosers,"" a serial about a struggling TV network, which is being developed to launch simultaneously on AOL and as a made-for-TV movie for the Showtime cable channel.
Tartikoff will continue to head his own production company and act as a consultant and adviser to America Online as chairman of Greenhouse, America Online said.
LightSpeed's founders were behind the first so-called ""episodic"" show on the Internet, called ""The Spot,"" which it sold to American Cybercast in early 1996. ""The Spot,"" an interactive soap opera about five people sharing a beach house in California, is still on the Web site of American Cybercast, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.
LightSpeed was founded in May 1996 by the creators of ""The Spot,"" after American Cybercast bought the program. Founder Scott Zakarin will be named president of programming.
Zakarin and his team launched another popular Internet soap -- ""GrapeJam"" -- last August.
America Online executives said Internet soap operas will be only one small part of its broad entertainment network, which will feature celebrity hosts, live events, news and other information about the entertainment industry.
""The focus (of the network) is on the entertainment industry and the entertainment business,"" said Greenhouse President Danny Krifcher. He declined to say how many staffers it will have, or what its projected revenues will be.
America Online plans to make money from the entertainment network through advertising revenues, licensing and through transactions, such as selling tickets to entertainment events, selling merchandise and offering premium information at a surcharge. But Krifcher declined to make any forecasts.
The closest competition America Online said it has on the Internet to its entertainment network are sites such as Mr. Showbiz, E! Online and a People magazine site devoted to entertainment. Analysts said AOL's biggest competition is Microsoft Corp.'s MP3 multimedia studio.
""This is a very big opportunity,"" Krifcher said. ""This is the beginning of what we think will be a series of exciting announcements and developments for us.""
Greenhouse also plans to launch other programming networks specializing in sports, romance, young adults, health and women. The networks will include content of current Greenhouse properties and new ones, to be distributed over AOL, the Internet and other platforms such as TV and books.
""Greenhouse is no longer just a venture capital company,"" Krasilovsky said. ""They are hoping to develop full media properties in their own right.""

12,"Many personal computer makers this week will roll out flashy multimedia PCs designed around a new chip by Intel Corp. -- a development that is expected to give the consumer sector of the industry a much-needed boost.
Intel will officially launch its much-anticipated P55C microprocessor using its so-called MMX (multimedia extension) technology Wednesday and a slew of companies will unveil new consumer PCs, notebooks and desktops using the new chip, which will offer much faster performance.
The company said the new chip will offer more than just faster speeds on the new PCs, but a spokesman declined to give any further details.
""Instead of just raw performance ... you get a richer experience,"" said an Intel spokesman in Santa Clara, Calif.
International Business Machines Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Gateway 2000 Inc., Toshiba America Corp., Sony Corp. and many other firms are expected to unveil new high-end PCs simultaneously with Intel's announcment.
Most machines are expected to be priced over $3,000.
Intel said that an MMX-based PC would be more like a television, with sharper images, three-dimensional graphics, faster audio and television-like video. Other benefits include faster video teleconferencing and Internet access.
""As more and more people use PCs, the expectations are higher and higher, from what they see in movies and television,"" the Intel spokesman said.
""This moves the PC platform a little further along to media-rich applications. Our goal is to surpass the TV in terms of audio and video.""
For example, he said, a user playing a video game on an MMX-based PC will feel as if he or she is in a video arcade.
""It's a tremendous kickoff to 1997,"" said Rod Schrock, a vice president of Compaq's Presario division.
""We are so excited about the new MMX processor that we redesigned the entire line of Presarios from the ground up. Customers are going to get a pretty dazzling experience.""
Schrock declined to give any product specifics, but he said that Compaq will launch its new Presario consumer PCs with MMX in the same timeframe as Intel's announcement.
""It should provide an added boost to the demand for the new generation of PCs,"" Schrock added. ""There was no major industry event in 1996, this year you have a new processor.""

12,"One of the hottest topics at a recent Internet trade show was so-called ""push technology,"" which directly broadcasts customised news to computer users hooked up to the Net -- but is also seen as the next area ripe for a shakeout     Internet broadcasters are led by companies
like privately held PointCast Inc., which announced a major deal with software giant Microsoft Corp. early last month.
Cupertino, Calif.-based PointCast and several other start-up companies deliver customised news -- or specific Web sites, depending on the service -- to consumer or corporate computer users, up to several times a day.
In other words, instead of searching the Web for the information they want, computer users have it sent directly to them.
The Yankee Group, a Boston research firm, predicts that by the year 2000 Internet broadcasting will be worth $5.7 billion in revenues. It now represents about $10 million in revenues a year.
""Making the Internet a broadcast medium is a direction that a lot of companies are going in, but that's already really crowded,"" said Ted Julian, an analyst with IDC Corp.
At the Internet World trade show, four of the best-known push technology companies exhibited and demonstrated their services, trying to differentiate themselves amid all the hype about direct Internet broadcasting.
But analysts said there are anywhere from 20 to 30 start-ups in this burgeoning area, as many companies are betting the concept will further change the World Wide Web and gain new advertiser interest.
""This is the new Web,"" said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at MecklerMedia Corp., host of the Internet World show.
PointCast was the first company to develop what are called personalized broadcast systems, and it now has 1.7 million subscribers. It delivers news from The New York Times, Boston Globe, Reuters Holdings Plc., and now MSNBC, the cable television-online news venture of Microsoft and General Electric Co.'s NBC.
PointCast and most of the other start-up companies operate on the same advertising-based model. They sell advertising space on their service and offer the service for free to subscribers.
By building up lots of subscribers, they can gain more advertising revenue.
The deal PointCast signed with Microsoft has the potential to significantly expand its subscriber base because PointCast will become part of Microsoft's next-generation computer desktop. Microsoft plans to incorporate its Internet Explorer Web browser in its next version of its Windows operating system, which dominates its market.
In a study last month, the Yankee Group said the Internet broadcasting market will significantly affect the way companies collect advertising dollars on the Web.
""The Web is hitting a wall"" in terms of people signing up for paid subscriptions for information, said analyst Melissa Bain of the Yankee Group. ""The Wall Street Journal (Interactive Edition) is successful, but not every content provider has had success. Users can get the information elsewhere for free.""
Bain said that, according to her report, 51 percent of all online users surveyed said that they typically access or use the same Web sites on a daily basis, making the ""push"" model attractive.
But with many more companies arriving on the scene and Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp. getting into the market, consolidation is on the horizon, because media companies will not want to develop a channel for each delivery system, most of which, for now, are proprietary.
""There is no way I am going to download all four of these, and I am in the industry,"" said Jerry Yang, one of the founders of search engine power Yahoo! Corp. ""This is a huge issue.""
But Yang said that Yahoo! and other Internet search engines are looking at push technology because it will enhance a user's experience with the Web.
""Look for Yahoo to do a lot of development with one of these companies, or a Yahoo!-branded push channel,"" Yang said in a recent interview. ""We will all experiment.""
At Internet World, StarWave Corp., one of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's many investments, demonstrated a service it plans to introduce sometime next year. Patrick Naughton, StarWave's chief technology officer, said the service will be free and demonstrated a television-like advertisement for Levi's on ""StarWave TV.""
Even the players themselves are predicting a shakeout.
Harmon of Meckler predicts that push technology will fuel a hot new wave of Internet initial public offerings. But unlike the search engine fever, when a bevvy of small, unprofitable companies went public -- only to see their stock prices sharply decline -- consolidation will come first, he said.
Another player, Freeloader, was purchased last year by Individual Inc. of Burlington, Mass. Freeloader lets subcribers choose what Web sites they want delivered to their computers and obtain news via Individual.
""Clearly, there will be a big shakeout,"" said Freeloader President Sunil Paul, adding that there is a lot of chaos right now. ""PointCast clearly stands out, and we will be one of them (the survivors).
Another much-talked-about start-up, IFusion, is offering television-like content with video and audio in its service, which will be introduced early this year and called Arrive.
The company that created some of the recent frenzy about ""push"" technology is Marimba Inc., founded by several former Sun Microsystems Inc. employees.
Marimba did not exhibit at Internet World, but the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company, which develops software tools to create these ""channels"" using Sun's Java programming language, was mentioned by everyone. Marimba, along with PointCast, were seen as the potential early IPO candidates of this sector.

12,"New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco said Friday that he planned to sue America Online Inc. if the company's negotiations with prosecutors from 20 states over consumer complaints about its service broke down.
Vacco told a news conference he would sue the world's largest online service, with more than 8 million subscribers, to halt allegedly deceptive business practices and to win refunds for the company's frustrated customers.
""I'm not interested in contrition, I'm interested in restitution,"" Vacco told reporters in Manhattan.
AOL has been hit by a slew of consumer complaints, including several class-action lawsuits, since switching to a new pricing plan because many frustrated users cannot get on the service or are dropped after they manage to log on.
America Online Chairman Steve Case said on the CNBC cable television channel that he was not considering subscriber refunds. He said the company was doing all it could to fix the problems and that he understood the frustrations.
""It is not something we are considering,"" Case said on CNBC. ""Most customers have seen a tremendous price cut, they have doubled their usage"" with the new plan, which costs $19.95 a month for unlimited access.
Vacco and other attorneys general or their aides from 20 states met with America Online officials on Thursday in Chicago, in person or via conference call, to discuss a barrage of complaints by subscribers who have experienced difficulty accessing the service from their computers.
Vacco said he sent notification Thursday of New York state's proposed litigation to America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va. He said a lawsuit would allege the company engaged in deceptive sales practices, false advertising and fraud in selling online services.
""Getting some sort of rebate or refunds from consumers is one of our primary concerns in this issue,"" said a spokesman for Attorney General Vacco, when asked about Case's comments. He said that New York State would file this lawsuit alone.
Washington state, one of the 20 states, said it was considering a range of options.
""Obviously one of the options is to file a lawsuit and obtain relief through the courts,"" senior assistant attorney general Sally Gustafson said in Seattle. Another was to negotiate a settlement, she said.
A spokeswoman for Dulles, Va.-based AOL said the company was still in discussions with all the attorneys general.
""We are likely to reach an understanding that will allow us to best meet the needs of our members,"" she said.
America Online stock fell 50 cents to $36.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Wall Street remains largely unfazed by the swirl of legal and media attention surrounding AOL.
AOL moved to placate angry customers last week, telling them it would spend $350 million to upgrade its network, $100 million more than it had announced in December.
It also asked them to try to cut use during peak hours, an unprecedented plea to its subscribers. Case even told members in his monthly newsletter to learn how to write and receive electronic mail offline, in so-called ""flash sessions.""
But New York's Vacco called AOL's attitude disingenuous.
""We want to give the consumers a choice that gives them a refund if they want it. Don't just say 'Hang on;' give them a choice, which includes getting out with their money."" There are 600,000 AOL users in New York state.
AOL has been hit with at least four class-action lawsuits by subscribers, including two in New York.
Vacco would not comment on Thursday's meeting.
Case also was reluctant to talk about the meeting.
""I'm not going to discuss what is on the table with the attorneys general,"" he said on CNBC, adding that the meeting was ""constructive"" and that the attorneys general asked AOL not to talk about it. ""Our interests are really in parallel.""
The move to unlimited access itself incurred the ire of many of the same attorneys general. Last month, AOL reached an agreement with 19 states over the flat-rate pricing, with AOL agreeing to pay automatic refunds to subscribers who did not want to pay $19.95 a month.
But analysts noted AOL had already told subscribers, before the agreements with the states, that it would give refunds to those who were switched to unlimited usage without their consent, if they wished to continue at a lower cost plan.

44,"Frozen yogurt firm Yogen Fruz World-Wide Inc is proposing to partly satisfy its appetite for expansion by teaming up with  Subway Restaurants and PepsiCo Inc's KFC unit, analysts said on Tuesday.
By offering its products in the fast food chains, part of a recent trend called co-branding, the Toronto-based firm could expand beyond 2,920-odd outlets. It is already the world's biggest frozen yogurt franchisor, ahead of TCBY Enterprises Inc of Little Rock, Arkansas.
""It's definitely a very strong growth story,"" said First Marathon Securities analyst Perry Caicco, who has a 52-week share price target of C$6.00.
Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange jumped 0.35 to 4.84 in brisk trading of more than 850,000 shares in late dealings. The rise was sparked by news that brokerage Gordon Capital will issue an analyst's report on the company on Wednesday.
First Marathon helped underwrite a private placement of five million special Yogen Fruz warrants at C$4 each announced in late January.
""The test they have going with the biggest potential to really kind of blow the doors off the numbers is with Subway,"" Caicco said.
The privately held submarine sandwich chain is the world's second largest restaurant franchisor after McDonald's Corp.
The company began testing with Subway in 20 U.S. locations a few weeks ago, Caicco said.
Yogen Fruz President Michael Serruya cautioned: ""It's is still very much in the initial stages.""
Yogen Fruz is also experimenting with KFC in some outlets in Panama. ""That happens to be farther advanced (than Subway),"" Caicco added.
KFC, which has had mixed results developing its own desserts for the past few years, has been watching the tests closely and has been pleased with early results, Caicco said.
Serruya said the company was exploring other arrangements: ""There are various other deals we're working on.""
Another expansion possibility is selling new flavors in U.S. grocery stores through the Destination Products International group, an offshoot of Cott Corp run by Canadian marketing guru Dave Nichol. Destination is 85 percent owned by Cott, a maker of private label products, and 15 percent by President and Chief Executive Officer Nichol.
""I think they're experimenting with a high quality hard-packed frozen yogurt product,"" Caicco said.
An analyst who declined to be identified said: ""Yogen Fruz has developed four or five flavors which they will package and sell.""
Caicco said Yogen Fruz is aiming toward a limited store test somewhere in the United States.
""We're talking with them (Destination Products),"" Serruya said.
In other developments, Serruya said, Yogen Fruz is planning to acquire one to three companies before its year-end of August 31.
Caicco said Yogen Fruz is eyeing a few complementary U.S. franchises, armed with the C$20 million raised in the private warrrant placement.
""They're actively, right now, looking at five or six deals in the U.S.,"" Caicco said. The other analyst said the prime target was in the north eastern United States.
Caicco added: ""They may also, in fact, purchase or acquire a franchise that is not specifically complementary to what they do, but might be something that they could move out into their very strong sort of international franchise network.
Yogen Fruz, which is running out of manufacturing capacity, is considering buying a Pennsylvania plant in the next one or two months, Caicco added.
Serruya would only say that it would be on the U.S. East Coast.

44,"Investors, who last week helped drive the Toronto Stock Exchange to its 50th record close this year, are unlikely to cool on Canadian stocks any time soon, attracted by Canada's improving economic fundamentals.
""Canada really has begun to address its deficit problems with rather Calvinistic virtue and I think this is going to help that market and also tend to focus other investors on the opportunities in Canada,"" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co Inc in New York.  
Toronto's key 300 Composite Index set its 50th record high close last Thursday, the most in a single year since Canada's largest stock exchange began tracking such figures. The previous record was 45 record closes for all of 1987.
The 300 index has risen almost 19 percent this year.
After the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, Toronto posted no record closes from 1988 through 1992.
But analysts said Toronto's latest bull run will likely extend to mid-1997.
""I don't think the run in the Canadian market is over by any means,"" said Metz.  
""There's such a rosy view out there on Canada,"" said HSBC James Capel Canada strategist Bob Boaz.
""Inflation is low. The federal deficits are coming down, especially in relation to GDP (gross domestic product). Current account surpluses are happening. The political situation (Quebec separatism) has faded away and that has buoyed the Canadian dollar,"" Boaz said.
Canada's inflation rate is now about 1.4 percent, while the federal government has forecast its yearly borrowing requirements will drop to zero in 1998/99 from C$28.6 billion in 1995/96.  
Booming exports have pushed Canada's current account to a surplus for the first time since 1984.
Political uncertainty has also waned after last year's narrow loss by separatists in a referendum on independence for the French-speaking province of Quebec.
On Friday, Canada's dollar strengthened to the US$0.75 mark for the first time in a year.  
""I think Canada's in a different situation"" than in 1987, Metz said. ""We're on the early stages of what I would call a boomlet worldwide, which is going to result in I think strengthening industrial and commodity prices, which I think are going to be very bullish for Canada.""

44,"- Chip designer Mosaid Technologies Inc will see earnings bounce back in fiscal 1998 as the chip market re-ignites, Chief Executive George Cwynar said on Wednesday.
Cwynar told Reuters in an interview that he saw profit and revenue growth accelerating to the 20 percent range in fiscal 1998 from about two percent in fiscal 1997 ending April 30.
""This calendar year we're in, is going to be a slow recovery year,"" he said.
Mosaid last week reported that earnings per share for the third quarter ended January 31 fell to C$0.06 from year earlier C$0.32 due to the collapse in memory chip prices in the past year and delayed orders for chip testing systems.     Cwynar
said he expected the memory chip market to come back in 1998 as personal computer users snapped up the backlog of cheap chips and increased demand for Mosaid's bigger, faster designs.
Analysts predicted that Mosaid, based in Carp, a town about 35 km (21.75 miles) west of Ottawa, would recover from its recent slump, aided by ACCELERIX, a single component that would combine the functions of memory and logic.
Mosaid spokeswoman Sue Rutherford said that up to five analysts planned to start coverage of Mosaid, which posted revenues of C$37 million in fiscal 1996.
One analyst who declined to be identified said: ""All the ingredients are there for a big comeback.""
Mosaid increased its work in memory/logic design after acquiring a large stake in ACCELERIX Inc in October 1996. Cywnar said the ACCELERIX design could increase speed and cut space demands, making it ideal for portable products that are rapidly capturing buyers' interest.
""We expect to have the design finished this spring sometime,"" said Cwynar, adding that Mosaid anticipated ""a production-ready design by the end of this calendar year.""
Mosaid shares were down 0.35 to 14.25 in late trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

44,"A Wal-Mart store in Canada is set to become the first-ever unionized outlet for the world's largest retailer.
The Ontario Labour Relations Board decided late on Tuesday to certify the retail/wholesale division of the United Steelworkers of America at the store in Windsor, Ontario, across the U.S.-Canada border from Detroit.
The ruling came despite a May 10, 1996 vote by Windsor store employees rejecting a union drive by 151-43.
But the tribunal, which administers labour laws in Canada's most populous province, ruled that Wal-Mart executives used unfair labour practices by refusing to tell employees if they would shut the store if it became unionized.
Van Horne said the board rejected a second vote at the store because it felt workers would still be reluctant to vote freely because of a perceived threat to their jobs or benefits.
Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has 136 stores in Canada and more than 3,000 worldwide, has defeated every drive to unionize its stores since its founding in 1962.
Wal-Mart came to Canada in 1994 and is now the country's biggest discount retail chain.
United Steelworkers representative Pat Van Horne said the board's decision could pave the way for more unionized Wal-Marts in Canada. ""Obviously this is a good precedent for us,"" Van Horne said.
But Wal-Mart Canada spokesman Ed Gould disagreed, saying: ""Many people will take a look at the process by which the expressed will of individuals can be denied and think twice"" about unions.
Van Horne said the next step was to negotiate a contract with Wal-Mart.
""The proving ground for the union will be our ability to get a collective agreement that satisfies the employees,"" Van Horne said.
Wal-Mart's Gould said the company might appeal the ruling.
""We're going to review the reasons and then we're going to consider the next steps and that could include obviously an appeal,"" Gould said.
Gould ruled out abandoning the Windsor outlet. ""We are not in business to close stores.""
Windsor employees earn about C$8.30 ($6.14) an hour plus profit-sharing and performance-based bonuses, Gould said.

39,"Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, reported on Wednesday a firm rise in sales revenue, signalling the worst may be over for the country's long-suffering merchants.
Coles announced a 5.4 percent rise in sales revenue to A$9.9 billion (US$7.5 billion) for the six months to January 26, sounding a rare note of optimism in an industry that has been hit hard by a downturn in consumer spending.
Coles, which pockets almost 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, attributed the result to good management rather than any pick-up in the economy.
""A lot of people have done a lot of work to get where we needed to get,"" Coles chief executive Dennis Eck told Reuters.
But Coles' announcement came a day after another retailer, David Jones Ltd, reassessed its profit outlook, painting a slighter brighter picture than the bleak dive in earnings it forecast just after Christmas.
David Jones, an upmarket department store chain, had told the Australian Stock Exchange early last month it feared a 50 percent fall in interim profit, but changed its mind this week.
""It will not be as bad as that,"" David Jones chief executive Chris Tideman told Reuters on Tuesday.
He did not elaborate but stock analysts said on Wednesday post-Christmas clearance sales helped lift the company's overall sales result to A$783 million for the first half year ending January 25 -- just one percent lower than a year ago.
""I think we have probably gone through the worst in spending, but I would not expect a dramatically big turnaround,"" said retail analyst Simon Shakesheff, of Macquarie Bank.
""The sentiment is still a bit fragile, but at the end of the day, until there's a bit more job creation out there, people are not going to be spending more,"" he told Reuters.
Another Sydney-based analyst agreed that consumers' wallets would be slow to open.
""I think we will (see a recovery) but I don't think we saw it in January,"" the analyst said.
Australian retail sales are at their lowest ebb since the nation's official statistician began counting them 35 years ago. They have fallen in trend terms in each of the past five months.
Employment has also been weak with Australia's jobless rate hovering at 8.6 percent.
Coles confirmed on Wednesday that trading conditions were still tough, especially in clothing and fashion. The group's only specialist apparel chain, Katies, reported a 4.7 percent drop in turnover in the latest sales figures.
But Coles' Eck said profit margins in its underperforming department store chains were improving, as store managers improved the quality of merchandise sold and pared back costs.
In sharp contrast to the group's 33.8 percent fall in net profit in 1995/96, Eck said he expected an increase in bottom-line earnings for the current year ending July 27.
""Our earnings are in line with our plan,"" he said.
Coles reported net profit of A$280 million in 1995/96, and stock analysts are forecasting a modest profit rise in 1996/97.

39,"The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, announced a major realignment of its sprawling empire on Wednesday and removed any doubt that London was its capital.
The group, born of a 1995 merger of London-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, said it would now manage its global businesses along six main product lines.
These were aluminium, copper, energy, industrial minerals, iron ore, and gold and other minerals. Together they reaped revenues of around US$8 billion for the group in calendar 1996 from operations on all six continents.
RTZ-CRA said it would shrink its Melbourne office, CRA's home base and until now the group's ""other"" headquarters. It will halve the staff there, shedding 100 jobs, and leave the office with a support role only. A total of 200 jobs will go worldwide.
The announcement provoked an angry response in parts of the Australian press. One newspaper said that CRA had been ""buried under the RTZ shake-up"".
CRA chairman John Uhrig said that the merger, which maintained the two firms' separate listings, had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders.
""It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation,"" Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne.
In London, RTZ-CRA executive chairman Robert Wilson told reporters the group would take a one-off restructuring charge of US$40 million this year, and expected to gain annual cost savings of $50 million to $60 million by 1998.
The reorganisation leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium, energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters.
The Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group's Johannesburg office would be closed, the company said.
The new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world, where operations differ by country, toward a single management for each global business.
It ensures RTZ-CRA does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with more nimble rivals which deal in just one commodity, the group said.
""RTZ-CRA is a big company by the standards of the industry,"" executive chairman Wilson said. ""We are striving to obtain benefits of scale without the bureaucracy that goes very often with size.""
Chief executive Leon Davis gave examples where, under the current structure, copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe.
""These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them,"" Davis told the news conference.
""It will eliminate duplication, lower our costs and improve our efficiency,"" he added.
Mining analysts welcomed the move. One viewed it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage, made without any shares actually changing hands, was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA.
""If anyone thought the DLC (dual-listed structure) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap, they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office,"" a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters.
The analyst said he expected the group to eventually transform the dual-listed structure into the one company, although in London Wilson denied that the changes would undermine the dual-structure.
RTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known, subject to shareholder approval this year, as Rio Tinto. RTZ's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd.
A Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group's headquarters came as no surprise. ""It doesn't make any sense to have two head offices,"" he said.

39,"A new diamond mine looks likely to go ahead in north Australia after one of its backers on Thursday described a final feasiblity study on the project as ""encouraging"".
Base metals miner Aberfoyle Ltd, which has a minority interest alongside diamond group Ashton Mining Ltd in the Merlin project in the Northern Territory, said the study was now virtually complete.
""I think both companies have previously said they expected this to be developed into a project, albeit not at a large scale initially,"" Aberfoyle managing director Mike Eager told Reuters.
""I think it's probably on track for that sort of conclusion,"" Eager said.
The feasibility study, prepared by engineering consultants Bateman-Kinhill, has been discussed by the two owners and could be decided upon as early as this month.
The report is due before Ashton's board on June 19.
Aberfoyle said both companies would make a final decision by the end of the September quarter.
Ashton owns 77.5 percent of Merlin. Aberfoyle has the rest.
The feasibility study assumes a modest start to mining, with stage one annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes of ore. Ashton has already said the first stage would cost about A$20 million (US$15.2 million).
The joint venture partners plan to develop some open pits before evaluating Merlin's underground mining resource and proceeding to a stage two expansion.
""We are still encouraged by what we have seen by the further work on site and the further (work on the) feasibility study and certainly there is no reason for discouragement,"" Eager said.
The Merlin prospect contains about 12 kimberlite pipes -- rock formations associated with diamonds -- and only three of them have been bulk sampled for diamonds so far, he said.
The sampling results suggest further upside to the project, Eager added.
""There's evidence in at least some of the pipes that there's an improvement in stone quality and perhaps in grade ... at the perimeters of the pipes,"" he said.
Ashton reported late last year that diamonds recovered from Merlin were described as being 35 percent gem quality, with the remainder near gem quality.
In its March quarter production report, Ashton said the results of recent cutting and polishing tests on 25 Merlin diamonds had been ""very encouraging"".
Ashton, which is owned 46.95 percent by Malaysia Mining Corp Bhd, owns 40.1 percent of the world's biggest diamond mine, the Argyle mine in northwest Australia.

39,"Australia's biggest aluminium producer, Comalco Ltd, plunged heavily into the red on Monday, blaming its loss for calendar 1996 on weak aluminium prices, an adverse exchange rate and higher smelting costs.
Comalco's net profit before abnormals slid to A$32.9 million in 1996 from A$264.8 million in 1995, in line with expectations, but abnormals dragged the bottom line to a A$16.8 million loss.
The result made a small dent in the stock's share price, which dropped eight cents on the news but recovered by 0125 GMT (12.25 p.m.) to A$6.80, down only two cents from Friday's close.  
Comalco is owned 67 percent by global mining group RTZ-CRA.
""The market has pretty much factored in the loss and is now focusing on future earnings prospects,"" a Brisbane dealer said.
As expected, Comalco's smelting division played a part in the earnings nose-dive.
Higher operating costs at its three smelters shaved A$32 million from group operating profit, Comalco said. It blamed this on higher prices for raw materials like fuel, power and coke, and on costs associated with smelter upgrades and expansions.

39,"The Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd's steel division expects to increase its earnings in the current 1996/97 year due to lower costs and improved operations, BHP Steel chief executive Ron McNeilly told Reuters on Thursday.
But BHP Steel sees no major improvement in its home Australian market until possibly the second quarter of calendar 1997, and expects the world steel market to pick up towards the end of the first half of next year, McNeilly said.  
Asked if BHP Steels profit for the the current year ending May 31 would be higher than the division's 1995/96 profit, he said: ""Oh yeah, yeah, but as I said we don't make any forecasts.""
McNeilly declined to give a forecast for 1996/97 profits but said improvements would be driven by lower costs.
""If there's going to be an improvement in our results -- and I am confident there will be -- it will be an improvement that's driven I think in the near term by better operations and lower costs rather than a market-driven improvement in the short term,"" he added.  
BHP Steel reported a 44 percent slump in profit to A$375 million before abnormals in 1995/96. Its bottom line sunk 76 percent to A$153 million after a A$222 million write-down of the value of its Newcastle raw steel-making plant in Australia.
McNeilly said he expected steel markets in Australia and abroad to pick around mid 1997, as the domestic economy improved and world steel demand, especially in Asia, fed through into a recovery in depressed world steel prices.
""I don't really see any significant improvement in the Australian scene until sort of maybe the second quarter of next year -- so quite flat,"" he said.  
McNeilly described domestic demand as very patchy.
""There are some signs of improved demand in the resource and infrastructure areas but no sign of any improvement whatsoever in domestic housing, in most of the rural sector and in general demand, so it really is quite flat,"" he said.
BHP's export despatches of steel have been increasing, but an intensely competitive steel market has weighed on prices.
McNeilly quoted International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) forecasts for strong world steel consumption over the next four years and said prices should strengthen between the first half of 1997 and the second quarter of 1998.  
""I think we will see towards the end of the first half of next calendar year, towards the end of the second quarter of 1998, an improvement in demand and prices in Asia and likewise Australia,"" he said.
""But I do think that from now until then, what we see now will be generally the situation.""
The IISI forecasts world steel consumption to grow at close to two percent annually to 714 million tonnes in year 2000, with most of this growth coming from Asia.  
""We are not seeing any improvement that's market derived and I don't think there'll be any improvement that's market derived over the next six months,"" he said.
BHP Steel's major new projects around the world are still being built and will not boost the division's profit until after 1996/97, he said.
""We won't see any major inflow of profitability from new projects, really until the second half of (calendar 1997), which is the first half of next financial year,"" McNeilly said.  
He declined to comment on speculation BHP is considering closing its old, integrated raw steel-making plant at Newcastle, rather than investing in a new electric-arc furnace there.
McNeilly said BHP's Glenbrook steel mill in New Zealand, also now under the spotlight, must slash A$50 million from its cost base. ""It absolutely has to happen,"" he said.
He said was encouraged by the resolve ""of all those involved"" at the 700,000-tonnes-per-year plant to cut costs.
""But if we have sites that don't and won't and can't, and tired assets that can't be rejuvenated, we have to bite the bullet and do the obvious.""  -- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421

39,"The consortium believed to be the winning bidder for Australia's Loy Yang A power station has minimised the U.S. dollar-component of the A$4.75 billion deal to about US$500 million, a corporate source said on Tuesday.
""There's no massive splash from a foreign exchange point of view,"" the source, who is close to the bidding, told Reuters.
The consortium said to have won the bidding comprises U.S. utilities CMS Energy Corp, with about 50 percent, and NRG Energy Inc and Horizon Energy Investments Ltd, each with about 25 percent.  
Local currency dealers said they thought about A$400 million to A$500 million cover had been taken on Monday ahead of the deal's announcement, which is likely at about midday.
Horizon is a vehicle for Australian institutions led by Macquarie Bank's Infrastructure Trust of Australia Group Ltd.
The consortium's capital structure is designed around a high gearing ratio of around 75 percent, with bank debt, indexed bonds and subordinated debt accounting for almost A$3.6 billion of the A$4.75 billion bid, sources said.  
All of the debt and a quarter of the equity component will be raised in Australia, leaving the balance of the equity to be funded offshore, the Melbourne source said.
""There's no big tranche of offshore dollars greater than what was done in the past for Yallorn and Hazelwood,"" he said.
The Victoria state government's earlier sale of its Yallorn and Hazelwood power stations involved around US$500 million in foreign equity, the source said.
The Loy Yang A consoritum's foreign exposure was already covered, he added.  
""We have mitigated already but, given the capital structure of the deal, there is a negligible impact from a foreign exchange point of view,"" the source said.

39,"Australian steelmaker, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, on Thursday raised the prospect of the world's steel giants forging alliances and together building huge steel mills in Asia to meet the region's increasing demand.
BHP Steel, Australia's biggest producer of raw steel, said companies might be tempted to jointly build major, traditional steel mills in the rapidly growing region instead of going ahead as expected with a rash of smaller new-technology plants.  
""We may see some of the major steel players in the world seriously considering international alliances where they come together to build steel facilities in the developing economies of the world,"" BHP Steel chief executive Ron McNeilly said.
Big traditional steel mills are in some ways better suited to Asia than the new-technology electric steel-making furnaces, which use large amounts of steel scrap as a feedstock, he told Reuters in an interview.
""The realities are there is not enough scrap in Asia,"" McNeilly said. But big traditional steel plants required billions of dollars of investment, he added.  
""The funds required ... would just be too large for me to be willing to take that on independently or separately as a single project, totally exposed to all of the risks,"" he said.
""But as a project in company with other people, it's something that we most certainly would consider,"" he added.
McNeilly, who is overseeing more than A$500 million of investment in new value-added steel production in Asia, also described plans by BHP's international rivals for major new steel capacity as ""talk"".  
Asian steel consumption is forecast by the steel industry to underpin strong world demand growth of almost two percent a year for the metal over the next fours year.
BHP's rivals in the Asian region have meanwhile announced plans for major new steel-making capacity, including plans by South Korea's Hyundai Group  for a six million tonnes a year traditional steel mill.
""There's certainly a lot of talk ... but there is not a lot of evidence of that (major new capacity) happening,"" McNeilly said.  
But he predicted competition in world markets for steel products to remain intense as the north Asian steel-makers of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea vied with European and U.S. steel giants for the growth markets of Asia and Latin America.
""The large successful players in the steel industry are looking for growth ...,"" McNeilly said.
""They're the people who are going to be looking for investment opportunities, for partners, for alliances with governments and for project opportunities in the region.
""And I think are also going to be looking more and more for other big players to be part of a project with them.""

39,"The world's biggest mining house, RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd, is set to report a sharp fall in annual profit this week after shouldering a slide in metal prices during the year and battling problems with its U.S. copper smelter, mining analysts said.
The group, which has operations spanning the globe, is on average expected to post a 26 percent fall in net profit before exceptional items to US$1.067 billion for calendar 1996, a Reuter survey of six Australian brokerages revealed.
The Anglo-Australian miner made US$1.441 billion in 1995.  
The analysts' forecasts range between US$1.04 billion and US$1.097 billion, although private forecasting service Barceps quoted much lower numbers in a survey last month.
The culprits behind RTZ-CRA's profit slump are seen as the copper price, which dipped below 90 U.S. cents a pound after the Sumitomo Corp trading scandal erupted in June, a sick aluminium price, down 16 percent in 1996, and problems with the flagship Bingham Canyon copper smelter in Utah.
Together, copper and aluminium earned almost 41 percent of RTZ-CRA's total revenue in 1995, and metal prices were promising enough early in 1996 for the group to talk of higher earnings.  
But metal prices caught cold and the prospects of improved profits also began to look sick mid-year, when the Sumitomo trading scandal involving trader Yasuo Hamanaka sent international copper prices crashing.
""Everything peaked ahead of this Hamanaka copper thing,"" said Peter O'Connor of Macquarie Bank.
""Most commodities slid from June on through to about September, October and there's been a bit of recovery in most metal prices since that time.""  
RTZ-CRA's iron ore business was also a disappointment, one analyst said, noting that sales for the year dropped six percent despite a lift in annual output.
Adding salt to the wound, the gold price also languished. Gold is a sensitive area for the mining giant, since it is fundamentally opposed to selling its production forward at a fixed price to lock in revenue.
RTZ-CRA's coal mines are also not expected to have relieved some of the pain inflicted on the group by weak prices.
One analyst expects coal earnings to fall 10 percent in 1996.  
RTZ-CRA's troubled Bingham Canyon smelter has stirred the deepest concerns among analysts, who have been waiting for the new plant to get it right after 18 months of hobbled operation.
""That's going to knock it (the result) around a bit,"" a Sydney-based analyst said.
The smelter is still not operating at full capacity and now faces a six-week shut-down soon for major modifications.
Copper division earnings are forecast to plunge by some 40 percent, according to HSBC James Capel's forecast.
Still, the brokerage likes the group's long-term prospects.  
""They have a very, very strong organic growth profile,"" said HSBC James Capel analyst Umit Safak. ""They have very substantial expansions coming up,"" he added.
These include expansions of the Escondida copper mine in Chile and the Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, as well as a stake in new gold mine on Papua New Guinea's Lihir island. Lihir is 22.8 percent owned by Southern Gold, which owned 75 percent owned by RTZ-CRA
""They have a very substantial exploration areas and a lot of very, very profitable projects in the pipeline,"" Safak said.

39,"Institutional investor National Mutual Holdings Ltd has arranged to meet St George Bank Ltd to discuss its merger with Advance Bank Australia Ltd in a sign of growing disquiet over the deal.
National Mutual's funds management arm, a top-20 shareholder in St George, wants to discuss the bank's decision not to put the merger proposal to a shareholders' vote.  
""We are coming close to having a position on that and we are meeting shortly with St George and we will make some decision at the end of the meeting,"" said National Mutual Funds Management Ltd's domestic equity investments manager, Paul Jennings.
He declined to comment further but market sources said on Monday that National Mutual and at least one other institution were lobbying St George to reverse it decision not to seek shareholder approval for the A$2.65 billion merger.
""Three institutions ... are a little bit up in arms about it and would like to see a meeting,"" a broker said.  
National Australia Bank Ltd, itself seen as a predator in Australia's rapidly consolidating banking sector, has already said it is disappointed at St George's decision, which has been approved by the Australian Stock Exchange.
""We are disappointed there would not be a shareholders' meeting and we were concerned about the level of information out there about a merger proposal,"" NAB spokesman David Upton said.
""Given there hasn't been any details of the merger released as yet, we thought it would be important to have a meeting to give shareholders an opportunity to discuss it and find out more,"" Upton said.  
He declined to comment when asked about a newspaper comment that NAB might have few legal options to oppose the bid.
""We simply wanted to make known that we were disappointed that there wouldn't be a meeting,"" he said.
St George's scrip and cash offer valued each Advance Bank share at A$7.30 -- or nearly three times net asset backing.
The Australian Shareholders' Association, representing small shareholders, said it had met St George last Friday over the question of a shareholders' meeting.
""We are not at all happy,"" association executive officer Tony McLean told Reuters.  
""The principle is that it's a very significant deal for the bank and we believe that shareholders should be involved in approving it,"" he added.
He declined to comment on his talks with St George but said: ""There will be an exchange of information between ourselves and the bank."" McLean declined to elaborate.
Asked if an extraordinary general meeting could be called to pressure St George into reversing its decision, he said: ""I guess that's a possibility.""

39,"Australian financial services group Colonial Ltd made a strong debut on the Australian share market on Monday, its share price soaring on listing.
In early trading, Colonial shares opened at A$3.31 (US$2.56), well above the A$3.10 paid by institutional investors in the company's public share offer, which closed last Friday.
The opening price eclipsed the A$2.60 paid by members of the public in the A$690 million float, but those who took their stag profits and ran on Monday failed to dent the price.
In late morning trade, Colonial shares were trading around the opening price, giving the company a market capitalisation of A$1.9 billion and putting it in the top 50 Australian companies.
""We are obviously delighted that we have come on with a premium. It's a strong market response,"" Colonial managing director Peter Smedley said after watching the opening share price flash up on the stock exchange boards in Melbourne.
Colonial on Monday became only the second life office to list on the local exchange, after one of its bigger rivals, National Mutual Holdings Ltd, made its debut last October.
Australia's biggest, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, will soon follow. It plans to shed its old mutual structure and list in Australia and New Zealand next year.
Smedley said he did not feel the share offer had been priced too low. ""I think the end result is a reflection of the fact we have set the price well,"" he told reporters.
""There was very heavy over-subscription from the public and a very positive response from institutions.""
Each share issued came with an underwritten option to buy more, enabling the company to raise another A$200 million between September this year and June 1998.
Colonial also made a strong debut on Monday on the New Zealand exchange, wher it has a secondary listing.
""It's certainly been an outstanding success,"" said Melbourne-based broker Kevin Lourey, of Peake Lands Kirwan.
Colonial is devoting some of the float proceeds to development of its life insurance business in Asia.
The group is spending US$163 million to buy out its old Asian partner, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd, from their equal life insurance joint venture based in Hong Kong.
Colonial has applied for a licence to sell life insurance in China and has operations across Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.
Its traditional offshore markets are Britain, New Zealand and Fiji.
Colonial will also use A$50 million of the float proceeds to complete the 1994 purchase of the State Bank of New South Wales, now renamed Colonial State Bank.
Colonial has total assets of A$29.7 billion and has forecast a net profit before preference dividends of A$180 million for calendar 1997, a-50 percent rise on its 1996 earnings.

11,"The chairman of ITT Corp has rejected an offer to meet the top executive of Hilton Hotels Corp, which last week launched a $6.5 billion hostile takeover of the hotel, casino and entertainment giant, sources close to the companies said.
In a letter faxed to Hilton chairman Stephen Bollenbach on Saturday, ITT chairman Rand Araskog said it would be inappropriate for the executives to meet or for Bollenbach to address the ITT board on Tuesday as he had requested, the sources said.
The sources described Araskog's letter as brief and formal.
An ITT spokesman declined to comment and a Hilton spokesman in Los Angeles could not be immediately reached for comment.
Bollenbach's request to ITT was disclosed in a January 31 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Hilton, which is trying to buy ITT in a cash and stock deal valued at $55 per share, formally launched a hostile takeover of ITT on Friday. Hilton also has proposed acquiring about $4 billion of ITT debt for a total transaction worth $10.5 billion.  
Wall Street experts widely expect ITT to reject the offer, which is considered to be too low. Although its stock has declined sharply in recent months, most experts estimate ITT is worth at least $65 per share.
ITT's advisers have spent the past few days poring over the formal bid filed with the SEC on Friday. The advisers are expected to present an in-depth analysis of the offer when ITT holds a regularly scheduled board meeting on Tuesday.
The ITT board, which has until February 14 to respond to the Hilton offer, is not expected to make a decision at the Tuesday meeting.
Sources close to ITT told Reuters that the analysis was likely to focus on Hilton's proposed financing for the transaction and a preliminary agreement with HFS Inc to license the Sheraton franchise. Hilton, which has estimated it will need about $3.5 billion to buy ITT, said its offer is not conditioned on obtaining financing.
Hilton has estimated the proposed union would generate more than $100 million in cost savings.
Hilton also has said that while it would prefer to negotiate a transaction with ITT, it would be prepared to launch a proxy fight to replace the ITT board of directors.
"
11,"Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. so far have convinced the courts that their $8.6 billion merger plan should proceed, but they still need to win over unhappy shareholders who favour Norfolk Southern Corp.'s higher rival bid.
Lawyers and financial advisers were expected in the next few days to consider several plans aimed at persuading investors to approve a crucial measure needed for the deal.
Meanwhile, CSX said Thursday that its $110 cash tender offer for 19.9 percent of Conrail shares, which represents the first part of its plan to buy Conrail, was oversubscribed.
The proposed stock and cash transaction has angered many investors, who prefer an all-cash $10 billion offer by Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va.
Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer of $110 a share, saying the union with CSX provides more strategic benefits.
But Norfolk Southern refused to give up, on Thursday extending its tender offer through midnight EST on Dec. 16. The offer had been set to expire Friday.
Norfolk Southern said earlier it would also continue to pursue its legal case seeking to block the planned merger.
CSX said that as of Thursday afternoon about 1.4 million Conrail shares had been tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to Norfolk Southern's offer.
Sources close to the companies said no final decision has been made about how to woo Conrail shareholders, but options include sweetening the stock portion of the deal or setting a ""collar"" to guard against price volatility.
They will also consider revising the deal's terms to accelerate payment to investors, according to the sources, who did not want to be identified.
The two companies could also decide to keep the terms unchanged, betting that shareholders will ultimately choose the CSX offer over Norfolk Southern's bid, which cannot be formally considered by Conrail until July.
""There's only one thing they can do and that's to sweeten the offer. I don't know how they're going to get enough votes if they don't,"" said Thom Brown, managing director at investment firm Rutherford, Brown &amp; Catherwood Inc., which holds some 50,000 shares of Conrail.
Richmond, Va.-based CSX and Conrail declined to comment on their plans but acknowledged last week they were discussing increasing the value of the pact upon its consummation.
Sources close to the companies said there is no rush to make a decision, noting that Conrail can easily postpone the shareholder vote that is now slated for mid-December.
CSX and Conrail won a significant victory this week when a U.S. District Court judge denied a request by Norfolk Southern to block the CSX-Conrail deal. An appeals panel also declined to block the first step of the deal.
Norfolk Southern, meanwhile, withdrew its motion for an expedited appeal of the federal court ruling that allowed CSX to buy the 19.9 percent stake in Conrail since the tender offer expired at midnight Wednesday.
But a Norfolk Southern attorney said the company will continue to pursue its legal case seeking to block the Conrail-CSX merger.
""We will continue with the litigation,"" attorney Steven Rothschild said.
A group of Conrail shareholders pursuing a lawsuit and appeal similar to Norfolk Southern's did not withdraw their motion for expedited appeal. The group urged the court Wednesday to hear an expedited appeal and ""sterilize"" the 19.9 percent Conrail stake by preventing CSX from voting it at a shareholders meeting needed for the merger to occur.
Because Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits a company from buying more than 20 percent of another company in a cash tender offer, shareholders will be asked in mid-December to approve a measure that would permit CSX to buy 40 percent.
The CSX-Conrail transaction calls for CSX to buy 40 percent of Conrail shares for $110 per share in cash and exchange the remaining 60 percent for CSX stock.
Sources close to the company said Conrail and CSX were well aware of the potential difficulties in winning the necessary votes.
Industry experts believe shareholders may be more willing to approve the 40 percent measure if they were guaranteed more favourable terms for the stock portion of the deal.
""They can't get the vote until they improve the back end of the deal and they know that,"" one takeover specialist said.
Meanwhile, Conrail stock tumbled, reflecting the expiration of CSX's tender offer. The stock fell $2.25 to $94.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Based on Thursday's stock price, the Conrail-CSX transaction values shares of Conrail at about $95.10 each. The stock portion of the deal would be exchanged at a value of about $85.15 for each Conrail share.
"
11,"Norfolk Southern Corp may win new allies with its latest plan to thwart Conrail Inc's planned $9.2 billion merger with CSX Corp, but Wall Street experts are not convinced the effort will succeed.
They said the outcome of Friday's crucial Conrail shareholder vote, already considered a tight race before Norfolk Southern disclosed its effort, is now even closer.
Norfolk Southern is ""trying to win over any uncommitted shareholder they can find,"" said Thom Brown, managing director of investment firm Rutherford, Brown and Catherwood Inc.  
Conrail needs shareholder support in order to proceed with the planned cash and stock CSX deal.  The railroad is asking investors to waive a Pennsylvania law that would essentially require CSX to pay for Conrail in cash.
Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion cash bid in favor of the CSX transaction.
Late Monday, Norfolk Southern launched a new attack on the Conrail-CSX deal, telling Conrail shareholders it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail shares for $115 each if they defeated Friday's measure.  
""It might have some influence on (the shareholders), but it looks to me like it may be too late.  This has been a tough battle for Norfolk Southern,"" Brown said.
Sources close to CSX and Conrail said the vote tally is expected to take a couple of days.
""Our sense is that Conrail may well lose that vote...Norfolk's strategy here appears to be to try to build on the momentum it began by aggressively courting Conrail's shareholders last week,"" wrote James Higgins of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in a report issued Tuesday.  
Although some analysts had speculated that the plan disclosed by Norfolk Southern could prompt Conrail to delay the shareholder meeting, the railroad earlier confirmed that the meeting will take place Friday.
Norfolk Southern's offer is higher than CSX's, but a merger of the two railroads could not happen any time soon. According to its pact with CSX, Conrail would be prohibited from entering a partnership with Norfolk Southern or any other party until 1999.  Norfolk Southern challenged the exclusivity pact in court, but a federal judge last week upheld the terms of the Conrail-CSX merger.
Analysts said that the latest move by Norfolk Southern is an effort to convince shareholders that it is willing to take the risk of buying a stake in Conrail even though it would be prohibited from buying the railroad for two years.
""I think it's going to be very close.  This tells shareholders that (Norfolk Southern is) deadly serious and willing to commit,"" said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group.

11,"ITT Corp. moved forward on Monday with preparations for its Tuesday board meeting at which it will consider a $6.5 billion unsolicited takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corp.
The meeting, to be held in New York, will be the first board session since Hilton launched its offer last week. The board, which has until Feb. 14 to respond to Hilton's offer, is not expected to make a decision right away.
ITT spokesman Jim Gallagher declined to disclose the time of the meeting. A source close to the company indicated that the session is likely to last most of the day.
On Saturday, ITT Chairman Rand Araskog turned down a request from Hilton's top executive to meet. Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach had asked to meet Araskog before Tuesday's board meeting or be permitted to make a presentation to the ITT board.
Araskog rejected the offer in a faxed letter to Bollenbach, saying it would be inappropriate.
The cash and stock transaction values ITT at $55 per share.
ITT stock, which rose sharply last week on views that Hilton will be forced to raise its bid, lost 25 cents to $56.875 in Monday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
As ITT was preparing for the meeting, Bollenbach flew to London on Monday to meet with Hilton's European partner. Hilton Hotels owns the rights to the Hilton brand in the United States and Ladbroke Group Plc. holds them in the rest of the world.
Hilton officials said Bollenbach, who was named to the Ladbroke board last month as part of the expanded alliance between the two companies, would attend a Ladbroke board meeting. He was due to return to the United States by mid-week.
Shares of Ladbroke traded in London rose on Monday amid speculation that ITT may bid for Ladbroke as part of its anticipated defense against a Hilton takeover. London analysts downplayed the speculation, which was fueled by a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that disclosed Ladbroke and ITT had discussed a possible joint venture or merger a year ago.
Meanwhile, Hilton said Monday that it expects soon to announce other hotel acquisitions.
""There are a lot of things on our plate. We've got things working on the hotel side,"" Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs Marc Grossman told reporters at an industry conference sponsored by Montgomery Securities. He declined to discuss details.
Separately, HFS Inc. Chairman Henry Silverman said in an interview that his company had been searching for a new hotel brand when it reached its latest agreement with Hilton. The Hilton offer for ITT includes a pact in which HFS would license ITT's Sheraton trademark, franchise system and management agreements.
Silverman said the preliminary agreement was struck with Hilton several days before it announced its offer for ITT and evolved from previous discussions between the two companies.
HFS is a consumer services company with hotel franchise, automotive and real estate holdings.

11,"Norfolk Southern Corp. Monday launched a new effort to derail a planned $9.1 billion merger between Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp., proposing to buy a stake in Conrail even though its takeover offer has been rejected.
The Norfolk, Va.-based railroad said it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail stock for $115 per share if investors defeat a key provision that would allow the proposed Conrail-CSX union to move forward. Norfolk Southern made its offer in a direct appeal to Conrail shareholders, many of whom are unhappy with the proposed Conrail-CSX transaction.
Conrail shareholders are scheduled to vote on the provision Friday at a special meeting in Philadelphia.
Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion cash offer, saying that the $9.1 billion cash and stock transaction with CSX provides more strategic benefits.
Conrail is asking shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law that effectively requires CSX, which already owns 19.9 percent of Conrail shares, to pay $110 per share in cash for the rest.
If shareholders waive that provision, Richmond, Va.-based CSX will buy another 20 percent of Conrail shares for $110 per share and acquire the rest of Conrail in stock.
Norfolk Southern asked shareholders to reject the measure, saying it would amend its existing all-cash offer in order to buy about 8.2 million Conrail shares. The purchase of the shares would represent the maximum number of shares that Norfolk Southern can buy without triggering Conrail's ""poison pill"" anti-takeover defence plan.
Once completed, Norfolk Southern would then begin a second offer for all remaining Conrail shares.
Norfolk Southern said the 9.9 percent offer would not be subject to termination of the merger agreement between Conrail and CSX and would not require any action by Conrail's board.
""Conrail shareholders have an opportunity to reassert control over their corporation and reject the coercive tactics being used to pressure them into approving CSX's inferior offer,"" Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode said in a statement.
Officials from Conrail and CSX could not immediately be reached for comment.
Norfolk Southern announced its plan after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
It also said a vote to reject the CSX/Conrail measure would signal the beginning of the process to unseat Conrail directors at Conrail's next annual meeting.
"
11,"Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. raised the stakes Thursday in the bidding war for Conrail, amending their $8.5 billion merger agreement to provide Conrail shareholders with another $870 million.
The new agreement would give Conrail shareholders another $16 per share, payable in CSX convertible preferred shares, as part of the stock portion of the cash and stock transaction.
CSX and Conrail are battling with Norfolk Southern Corp., which has bid $10 billion, or $110 per share in cash, for Conrail.
An industry analyst estimated the value of the new CSX-Conrail deal at $104 per share, or $9.5 billion.
Norfolk Southern Corp. said after the amended deal was announced that it remained determined to acquire Conrail, was studying its options and would respond on Thursday or Friday.
Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern's offer, contending that a transaction with CSX is a better fit.
Other aspects of the Conrail-CSX agreement are unchanged. They include $110 per share for 40 percent of the outstanding Conrail shares and 1.85619 shares of CSX common stock for each Conrail share.
The proposed merger of Conrail and CSX, first announced on Oct. 15, would create a giant that would dominate the rail freight industry on the East Coast.
In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Conrail shares traded at $100.375, up $1.375, and CSX traded at $44, down $1.25. Norfolk Southern traded at $86.375, down 12.5 cents, also on the NYSE.
CSX and Conrail also established a voting trust to permit payment to Conrail shareholders by 1997.
The companies said a Conrail shareholder meeting slated for Dec. 23 would be rescheduled for Jan. 17 and the CSX tender offer would be extended to Jan 22.
The revised pact prohibits Conrail and CSX from entering into an agreement with a third party until Dec 31, 1998. The previous transaction set a July 1997 date.
""In every respect this merger holds great potential and clearly offers the best result for Conrail. This amendment to the merger agreement reaffirms the decision of the Conrail board that it is not willing to agree to the sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern,"" Conrail chairman David LeVan said in a statement.
CSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer at $110 per share and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent.
""The actions taken by the CSX and Conrail boards allow us to move on to the next stage of the process, the filing of our merger application with the (Surface Transportation Board),"" the federal regulatory agency overseeing railroads, said CSX chairman John Snow.

11,"In yet another sign that U.S. utilities are branching out far beyond their traditional markets, PacifiCorp and Protection One Inc on Friday announced a marketing alliance aimed at boosting customer loyalty in an increasingly competitive industry.
Under the venture, customers of PacifiCorp subsidiaries Pacific Power and Utah Power will be offered a security system from regional alarm company Protection One.
The unusual alliance is viewed as the first of many creative ventures in an uncertain era of deregulation.  
""This is the start of what is going to happen all over the place.  It's a whole new business that will coattail on the aggressive nature utilities are starting to take.  One-stop shopping is becoming key from a marketing position,"" said Ron Chebra, manager of utilities and energy industries at AT&amp;T Solutions.
Utilities are becoming increasingly attracted to security companies as they prepare to enter new markets that previously had been off-limits due to federal regulations.  In recent months, utilities have bought security firms or made large investments in them.  
""We're looking for new products and services that we can bring to our customer base as a way to build loyalty and ultimately build preference with our residential customers,"" said Rene Carroll, consumer products manager at PacifCorp.
""We've been looking at different ways of entering the home security business for over a year,"" she added.
The alliance will give Protection One instant access to the 1.4 million customers served by the PacifiCorp subsidiaries and extend its reach to Utah.  Previously, the regional security firm served six western states.  
At a recent conference on mergers in the security industry, Protection One officials declined to discuss potential revenue from the alliance but noted that capturing even five percent of PacifiCorp customers would be significant.  Customers accepting the offer will receive free installation of a home security system with the purchase of a two-year agreement for monitoring services.
The security system's alarm panel also will hold thermostat and lighting controls and remote access.
The alliance is expected to be just the first step for Protection One, which is trying to take advantage of new opportunities that are emerging from deregulation of the utilities and telecommunications industries.  ""We think this is the first of quite a few announcements we'll be making in the next 12 months or so,"" Protection One chief financial officer John Hesse told Reuters at the security conference.
The alliance re-establishes a link between the two companies that was dissolved several years ago.  Protection One began as a subsidiary of PacifiCorp in 1988, but the alarm company split off in a management buyout three years later. Protection One then became a publicly-traded alarm company in 1994.

11,"The top executives of Conrail Inc., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. met Friday in a critical session aimed at resolving a stalemate in the three-month takeover battle for Philadelphia-based Conrail.
The three companies declined to comment on the session, but hinted that future meetings could be forthcoming.
""Conrail, CSX and Norfolk Southern have concluded their meeting and have agreed that no further details on this meeting or timing of future meetings will be announced,"" the railroads said in a joint statement.
The long-awaited meeting between chief executives David LeVan of Conrail, John Snow of CSX and David Goode of Norfolk Southern is viewed as critical to railroad consolidation on the East Coast.
Conrail has rejected a $10.3 billion cash offer from Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern in favour of a $9.6 billion cash and stock transaction with Richmond, Va.-based CSX.
The deal ran into trouble earlier this month when Conrail shareholders defeated a key provision that would have permitted the planned merger with CSX to move forward. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern is now in the process of buying 9.9 percent of Conrail's stock.
The three executives agreed last week to hold a meeting to discuss competitive issues in the railroad industry. Conrail and CSX have stressed they are committed to their transaction and Norfolk Southern has said it would not accept any resolution that would value Conrail at less than its $115 per share offer.
Wall Street analysts expressed cautious optimism about the meeting, but warned that any end to the stalemate would be difficult and lengthy. On Wednesday, Goode also said that negotiations would likely be tough.
""We would suggest it is the first of many meetings, but it's a step in the right direction,"" said Thomas Galvin of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, noting that East Coast railroad consolidation has been discussed for the past 10 years.
Separately, the head of the federal agency that oversees railroads, reiterated her support of private sector negotiations to resolve competitive access issues in railroad mergers.
""What history has shown us is that private sector negotiations do result in the benefit to the parties involved and the public at large,"" said Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, in a speech at the National Mining Association's annual transportation conference being held in Florida.
Although Morgan did not address the Conrail case specifically, she said the board would look to preserve competition in the nation's rail network.
Shares of Conrail dipped 12.5 cents to $107.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock also fell 12.5 cents to $48.50 and Norfolk Southern shares fell 50 cents to $88.625, also on NYSE.

11,"The U.S. food industry, besieged by years of slow growth, wants to whip up new business from people who don't cook.
Armed with a new study that predicts consumer spending on ready-made foods will accelerate in the next 10 years, food firms are reaching out to a generation that doesn't know the difference between baking powder and baking soda.  
""Consumers aren't looking anymore for a cake mix.  They want the slice of cake,"" said John Gray, executive director of the International Foodservice Distributors Association, which helped fund the study released this week.
Industry executives this week said they are developing fresh strategies to feed 18-to-24 year olds -- a generation that grew up with working mothers and microwave ovens.
""Cooking from scratch is diminishing: many consumers in 2005 will never have cooked a meal from basic ingredients,"" said the study by consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co Inc titled ""Foodservice 2005: Satisfying America's Changing Appetite.""  
The study confirms trends that food manufacturers and food distributors already are seeing: harried consumers bypass the fresh meat and spice aisles of a supermarket in favor of sections selling barbecued chicken and ready-made salad.
The study projects the food industry will grow 1.6 percent per year to nearly $800 billion a year by 2005.  The foodservice sector is expected to capture nearly all of the anticipated incremental sales, pegged at $100 billion.  
""There is going to be a whole new plethora of different foodservice opportunities,"" said William Eacho, president and chief executive officer of  Atlantic Food Services, a Virginia-based foodservice distribution company.
Tomorrow's supermarkets are expected to have drive-up windows where consumers can buy ready-made meals.
Executives also envision stores that group food by meal categories so that shoppers can head right to the breakfast aisle instead of wandering throughout the store.  
The changes are expected to be especially challenging for food manufacturers, who may see shelf space for their products shrink as stores provide more ready-made products.
Nabisco Holdings Corp already is experimenting with ways to ensure its products are not lost in the shuffle.  The maker of items such as Oreo cookies and Grey Poupon mustard wants to leverage its brand popularity into ready-made meals.
""As a major food manufacturer, we ought to have our fair share of that growth,"" said Henry Lambert, president of Nabisco's food service company.  
That may mean developing a Grey Poupon-based sandwich spread for supermarket sandwiches or working with a dessert manufacturer to sell individual slices of cheesecake that contain Oreo cookies, Lambert said.
And demand for those kinds of products is expected to grow as consumers spend less time preparing meals.  Industry experts estimate people now spend about 20 minutes preparing a meal versus two hours of preparation time about 50 years ago.

31,"Britain's largest brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle Plc will see more benefit from its Courage brands in its half year results due on Monday, but its holiday village business Center Parcs will hold it back, analysts said.
""The company will see an improvement from a full contribution at Courage, but what is really holding it back is Center Parcs and there could be a worry on the currency with the recent strength in the pound,"" said Nikko analyst Dermott Carr.
Analysts forecasts for pretax profits range from 178 to 198 million stg up from 154.5 million last time.  
Dividend forecasts centre on 7.0p. Brewing is expected to contribute some 80 million stg, with 45 million of this total anticipated from Courage. Courage made just 9.0 million stg in operating profit, on turnover of 298.9 million stg, to overall group profits in the first half of 1995.
S&amp;N acquired Courage from Australian brewer Foster's in August, 1995 to create Britain's largest brewing group in a deal that cost about 550 million stg. Since then S&amp;N has quickly set about reducing its brewing capacity by some 1.5 million barrels a year, initially by closing two breweries and shedding some 1,600 jobs.  
John Smith's Courage is now Britain's leading ale brand.
The group's Center Parcs holiday resorts are expected to suffer from continued weak consumer leisure spending in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Center Parcs made operating profit of 82.0 million stg in the year to April 28, 1995 down 2.1 percent on turnover of 365.3 million. S&amp;N's new village at Bispinger Heide in Germany was opened against a very weak economic background in July 1995 and the cost of opening was higher than the company expected.  
Pontin's, S&amp;N's other leisure brand, made trading profits of 3.6 million, down from 4.1 million due to the sale of four sites and major refurbishment work at two others.
The performance of its Center Parc villages in the Netherlands and Belgium were adversely affected by a lack of consumer confidence and cut price competition from operators and it responded by investing heavily in those countries.
Analysts expect this trend to have carried on into the first half of the year, forcing the leisure division to report profits down some 5.0 million at 45 million.  
The company has three Center Parcs in Britain at Nottingham in the Midlands, East Anglia and Longleat, in the west of England. It owns two in France, one in Germany, two in Belgium and six in Holland.
However, S&amp;N's retail division, which includes the 1,600 strong chain of Chef &amp; Brewer restaurants, should see trading profits improve by increased investment aimed at rebranding and lifting the image of some outlets.
The company's managed pub estate has been rebranded to include pub-cafe bars like Rat &amp; Parrot and entertainment pubs like Big Hand Mo.  
The consensus of analysts forecasts for profits from the retail division rests at 88 million stg, up some 8.0 million on the first half of 1995. The division includes an estate of 740 tenanted and about 1,850 managed pubs as well as Chef &amp; Brewer.
The company's shares have outperformed its peers by about eight percent since February, but started underperforming the FTSE100 index by some six percent since late September.
The shares were up 142p at 642 on Friday from their 500p close on January 3. Return on equity is currently running at 5.62 percent, half its 11.32 percent level in 1995, against 10.44 percent currently for Bass.  
Operating margins have fallen to 12.27 percent from 15.46 percent in 1995.
A Reuter poll of 23 brokers estimates produced a consensus estimate EPS of 44.8 for the year ended April 28, 1997 rising to 49.5 for year end 1998.

31,"Gareth Davies, chief executive of British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco, which de-merged from conglomerate Hanson in October, said on Thursday it was difficult to see growth in Britain, although it hoped to make this up by expansion in the Asia- Pacific region.
""In Britian it is difficult to see the market growing given the punitive taxes. We are likely to see continued strong growth, though, in the Asia Pacific area of the world,"" he said.  
Earlier, Imperial posted profits of 303 million stg from Britain in the year ended September 28, unchanged from its 1995 level but profits from overseas grew 55 percent to 70 million.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, announced an increase of 15p on a packet of 20 cigarettes in his November Budget. After a similar rise in 1995, British cigarette sales fell by 2.5 percent to 81 billion.
Davies said he expected the same sort of fall again. He said the latest tax rise would fuel smuggling by widening further the gap between taxes in Britain and mainland Europe.

31,"Scottish-based Stakis Plc on Wednesday reported a surge in visitors to its casinos and a sharp rise in its hotel room rates, with chief executive David Michel in confident mood about future trends.
""In real terms we are just back to where room rates were in the late 1980s. Room rates have just about reached their pre-recession levels in the provinces,"" Michels told Reuters.
The company's hotels, excluding the Metropole in London acquired in November for 327 million stg ($543 million) from Lonrho, showed an occupancy level of 71.8 percent in the first 13 weeks of 1997, a touch down from 72 percent last time.
But its average room rate rose to 50.10 stg over the same period, up from 45.58 in 1996.
""In the first quarter we did 10 percent, but I still think the average will be 7.5 percent or more over the year,"" said Michels. ""Our forecast is to finish this year at 76 percent occupancy,"" he added.
Although January was a typically dull month for hotel occupancy, future bookings are at similar levels to last year, giving every confidence Stakis can achieve its target, he said.
The group's hotel occupancy was also pulled back slightly in the period by the temporary closure of the Stakis Tyneside where work is underway on a 3.5 million stg refurbishment.
During the six weeks Metropole traded under the Stakis flag, it showed 64.7 percent occupancy at an average price per room of 64.77 stg for its 2,266 rooms.
In a trading statement, Stakis said attendance at its 23 casinos rose to 603,000 in the quarter up from 525,000, but the spend per head fell to 110 stg from 129 .
Turnover at the casinos rose 20 percent to 14.2 million stg driven by the 17 percent increase in attendances.
The fall in spend per head mainly reflected the sale of the Barracuda casino in April last year to Ladbroke, said Michel. The spend per head at the Barracuda averaged 450 stg.
But Michel was encouraged by the increased casino attendance. ""More people realise that they are a reasonable night out, you don't have to spend 100 stg,"" he said.
""We have spent a year trying to make them do so, we've made a number of conversions, one big new build, and promotions to our base membership of 900,000, and we have introduced new training tables.""
The improvements coincided with an increase in newspaper and television interest in casinos.
Stakis shares were up 1-1/2p at 103p in early trade. ($1=.6021 Pound)

31,"John McGrath, chief executive of drinks and food company Grand Metropolitan, said the company should be able to return cash to shareholders in 1998 when its debt will be at least one billion pound lighter.
""By early next year our debt should be down in the low to middle two billion (stg) area and interest cover will be seven times or thereabouts. But we cannot afford buybacks at the moment. They depend entirely on our ability to sweat our assets and our ability to throw off enough cash in the next financial year.""  
Market forecasts for 1997 pre-tax profits centre on a range of 1.04-1.06 billion stg for the full year to September 30, 1997 with many brokers cutting their estimates as sterling started its run up against the dollar in May. Estimates for GrandMet's 1996 pretax profits are bunched around the 980 million stg mark.
""We are really being hit by the dollar at the moment. At a rate of 1.60 it will hit us by about 16 million pounds a year, assuming this rate continues into 1997,"" McGrath said.
The dollar stood at 1.493 against the pound on May 1 before climbing to its 1.638 level today.
Pillsbury, GrandMet's U.S. foods business and Burger King generate about 60 percent of group earnings in dollars.
At GrandMet's spirits arm International Distillers and Vitners price rises have ""stuck very well, probably better than they have done in a decade. Volumes are also up and we have had a good year in the U.S.""
""I think what will surprise the competition will be our performance in Europe,"" he said.

31,"Anglo-Dutch food-to-detergent group Unilever Plc, reporting third quarter results next Friday, is likely to have suffered from restructuring costs for its North American industrial cleaning business Diversey and from weak ice cream sales in a drab European summer, analysts said.
Diversey, acquired in January from Molson for 360 million stg, was merged with Lever Industrial in October to form a combined business with annual turnover of 1.15 billion stg and a workforce of 13,000 in 60 different countries.  
Analysts predict third quarter pretax profits in a range of 760 to 820 million, against 786 million stg last time.
The wide range reflects uncertainty about the size of redundancy payments and closures needed to reshape Diversey.
Charges for Diversey could range from 15-30 million stg, with a further 20 million needed for restructuring other Unilever businesses.
But the half-year dividend, paid in the third quarter, is forecast to rise sharply as a result of changes to dividend policy announced at the full year.  
Analysts expect a 10.3p dividend payout under a new policy whereby 35 percent of the previous year's total dividend would be paid in the stronger of either Dutch guilder or sterling so far this year. A 10.3p payout would represent a 46 percent increase on the previous half-year's 7.05p.
For the nine month period analysts are forecasting pretax profits of about 1.9 billion pounds.
""European ice cream sales are not going to have the special benefit they had in 1995 or 1994,"" said John Campbell, analyst at Paribas.  
""European economies are generally weak, and German consumption if anyhing lower because of the tough economic climate there,"" he added.
Michael Bourke at Panmure Gordon saw three factors behind the downturn.
""The exceptional charge will be a bit higher, perhaps about 40 million compared with 20 million the year before, and ice cream sales in the third quarter will have been influenced a lot by the summer weather.""
""Last but not least is the currency factor, with the majority of Unilever profits in US dollars and the recent weakness in the dollar clearly having an impact.""
The consensus forecast EPS for 1996, taken from 24 brokers polled by Reuters, is 84.40p, rising to 92.30p in 1997. Six brokers downgraded their 1996 EPS forecast in October.
Unilever's return on equity is currently running at 27.3 percent, against 66.57 percent for Unigate, the highest in the FTSE all-share food manufacturing sector.

31,"B.A.T Industries, reporting a nine percent rise in nine-month profits, on Wednesday ruled out a demerger of its tobacco business despite conceding that U.S. tobacco litigation was the main issue affecting its share price.
Chief executive Martin Broughton said the company did not see value in demerging the group into separate tobacco and financial services companies.
A strategy review showed ""there was no value we could see that would be generated from a demerger,"" he told Reuters.
Profits in the nine months rose to 2.04 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from 1.87 billion last time. Profits in the third quarter rose to 714 million from 680 million pounds.
Trading profit from financial services rose by three percent, and profits from tobacco were seven percent ahead.
Worldwide cigarette sales rose by three percent, although volumes were lower in the United States, a market where total industry sales were flat, the company said.
The growing pace of litigation claims against the company's U.S. cigarette subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson (B&amp;W), and the U.S. industry in general, continues to unsettle investors and hurt B.A.T's share price.
B.A.T shares have fallen from a high of 585 pence on February 2 to below 430 pence, shedding nearly four billion pounds from the company's stockmarket value along the way.
Broughton said a demerger of Brown &amp; Williamson would be ""highly destructive"" of shareholder value, adding there was ""no question"" that the board of directors was united on the issue.
He also played down fears over U.S. litigation. Only a few cases actually get to court although many are filed, and the company was confident of winning its appeal in the high-profile Carter case, Broughton told a meeting of company analysts.
In the case of Grady Carter, of Orange Park, Florida, a jury in Jacksonville ruled in August that B&amp;W was negligent and made a dangerous and defective product. Carter smoked for 50 years until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.
B.A.T shares have fallen sharply since the Florida court decided to award damages of $750,000 to Carter.
Lawyer Woody Wilner, who acted for Carter in the Florida case, had promised to bring one case a month, but three have been postponed until next year and one dismissed, B.A.T said.
B.A.T was also confident of blocking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's attempts to bring tobacco regulation into line with drugs and pharmaceuticals, said Broughton.
If the FDA proposals become law, cigarettes will be classified as ""medical devices"" and would have to meet rigorous safety and sales criteria.
Responding to a recent paper in the U.S Science Magazine which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, Broughton said B.A.T had no internal research which proved smoking caused lung cancer or that smoking was addictive.
""We have not concealed, we do not conceal and we will never conceal,"" he said. There was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking, he added.
Turning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and the African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.
In financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year. In Britain, the Eagle Star insurance division faced fiercely competitive conditions and profits fell to 162 million pounds from 194 million.
It also suffered a 91 million pounds charge for a surge in asbestos and pollution claims in the United States.
The life insurance and investment business reported a five percent increase in profit.
Shares in the company initially rose after the results, but later fell back to close at 427-1/2p pence, down 8-1/2p. ($1=.6223 Pound)

31,"Tobacco to insurance group B.A.T Industries Plc reported a five percent rise in 1996 profits to 2.495 billion pounds ($4 billion) on Wednesday, hit by an exceptional charge of 160 million pounds for U.S. environmental claims against its Eagle Star insurance unit.
Excluding the charge, profit rose by seven percent.
Chairman Lord Cairns said in a statement B.A.T dismissed any liability for damages currently being claimed by smokers in a string of tobacco related lawsuits in the U.S.
The company also said it kept an open mind on its corporate structure, but gave no news of any concrete plans.
As well as disappointment over the exceptional insuarnce charge some analysts had hoped B.A.T would say more about the possible demerger of its tobacco and insurance arms.
B.A.T shares, up 32 percent since November as its legal battles in the U.S. looked more promising, tumbled 20 pence to 530 pence in early trade.
""We continue to believe that B.A.T Industries itself has no potential liability in any U.S. tobacco litigation,"" Cairns said, adding that the tobacco industry was confident of winning the cases and does not intend to offer a settlement.
However, Cairns said the company would be prepared to ""evaluate proposals from third parties to provide relief from all current and future suits, provided that they were in shareholders' interests"".
Cairns said, ""Our twin goals are to improve the long term growth prospects of our business and to increase shareholder value. We continue to evaluate business oppurtunities and issues of corporate structure that will enable us to meet them.""
B.A.T director of public affairs Michael Prideaux told Reuters the company was keeping an open mind. ""We were surprised by media reports that we had ruled out a demerger,"" said Prideaux. ""We are not convinced that simply doing the splits helps either business much, what we are saying however is we have an open mind.""
The company has looked at several options for improving shareholder return over the last year, including merging its financial services arm, comprising mainly general and life insurance companies, with another insurer.
Prideaux dismissed the idea of floating off the company's U.S. cigarette arm Brown &amp; Williamson as a way of ringfencing the rest of B.A.T from any potential payments to smokers in the United States.
""Tobacco is strategically managed as world wide business so simply floating off B&amp;W would be a classic way of destroying shareholder value because B&amp;W plays an integral part in developing U.S. international brands around the world,"" said Prideaux.
""If it became independent you would probably end up with separate sales networks.""
B.A.T's tobacco business turned in a 7 percent overall improvement in local currency to 1.634 billion pounds with group volumes four percent ahead and world market share increasing to 12.8 percent from 12.4 percent.
Trading profit from financial services grew by an underlying eight percent to 1.2 billion with strong performances from two insurers Farmers in the U.S. and Allied Dunbar in Britain.
The company recommended an eight percent increase in the base dividend to 26.0p, with a further 3.5 pence to be paid as a foreign income dividend.

31,"Brian Stewart, chief executive of brewer to leisure group Scottish and Newcastle Plc, said on Monday he expected an improved performance from its Center Parcs holiday resorts in the second half.
""We would expect Center Parcs to be much more on the front foot in the second half and we would quite clearly spell out that conditions in Germany are now more positive,"" said Stewart in an interview.  
S&amp;N's profits from Center Parcs fell 11.4 percent to 38.9 million stg in the first half due to the weak economic background in mainland Europe and the cost of improving its parcs in Holland and Belgium.
The company sold its smallest village at Lommerbergen, Holland and had to close its De Eemhof parc in the Benelux while it upgraded the centre.  
""There were three hits to profits on Center Parcs. One million from the strength of sterling against the guilder, one million in redundancy for restructuring in the Benelux and 1.3 million from the effective closure of Eemhof while we were restructuring the centre,"" said Stewart.
He said no more new parcs would be built until consumer demand improves in mainland Europe. However, even in the absence of any pick-up in consumers leisure spending the Center Parcs business will do better in the second half, said Stewart.  
S&amp;N's leisure business, which includes Pontin's holiday camps, represented the one drag on its half-year results, with its other two divisions, beer and pubs, both performing strongly.
The inclusion of Courage, acquired from Australian brewer Foster's last year, for its first full half-year pushed operating profits on the beer side by 67 percent to 89.9 million.
Margins improved on beer sales, both for take-home and in pubs and restaurants, but this meant giving up unprofitable sales, resulting in a small loss of market share for S&amp;N.  
S&amp;N posted trading profits up 8.2 percent at 87 million stg from its pub division, driven by its managed outlets where like- for-like food sales grew by 13 percent as the company developed more restaurants.
S&amp;N will increase its capital expenditure by 25 percent from last year's level to 120 million stg at the end of its current financial year, said Stewart.
The company will open 35 new Chef &amp; Brewer pub restaurants by the year-end and push the Barras &amp; Co community pub brand very strongly, he said.  
""We will really be pushing down the accelerator on our community pubs Barras. Our focus has previously been on the high street or city centre and these community pubs really have a great deal of potential,"" said Stewart.
However, profits from the company's tenanted pubs fell some 9.0 percent to 11.8 million. The company sold 100 pubs in the first half period, reducing its number of tenanted pubs by 14 percent and managed outlets by 3 percent giving it a total estate of about 2,600 pubs.
The sales mean S&amp;N has now met its obligation to government to reduce the size of its pub estate as a condition of the company being allowed to acquire Courage.
""Overall, I think our 10 percent dividend increase, at the top end of the range, is a measure of our confidence for the second half of the year. General trading conditions are at least as good as they were this time last year and there has been a bit of an improvement in mainland Europe,"" said Stewart.

""We do see leisure as offering very significant growth oppurtunities, we have to take the rough with the smooth and we have a period which is difficult but we will overcome that,"" he told Reuters late on Tuesday.
Profits from Center Parcs resorts were down 11 percent at 39 million pounds at the half-year stage due to weak economic conditions in mainland Europe and the cost of improving its facilities in the Netherlands.
The relatively poor performance of S&amp;N's leisure division has caused many analysts to question the wisdom of S&amp;N's move into leisure.
""We certainly hope the consumer gains a little bit of confidence in Europe but we are very positive about initiatives we are taking now to get Center Parcs back on track.""
Bookings in UK Center Parcs were ""very strong and well ahead of last year,"" said Stewart.
He said the planned opening of Rank -owned village holiday resort Oasis was no more serious a competitive a threat than any other leisure deveopment.
He said the company planned to concentrate on existing Center Parcs and no new Center Parcs would be built in the next year.
""We are very positive about our future prospects from our leisure division, where we see significant growth oppurtunities,"" said Stewart, adding that he expected to see some improvement in mainland Europe from Center Parcs in 1998.
""Whether the consumer recovers in terms of confidence, especially in Germany, I think is debatable because there will be political and economic uncertainty there this calendar year.""
He said S&amp;N was unconcerned that it had lost some market share to Bass BASS.l in the beer market.
""I'm not worried about the competition, I'm worried that our brands continue to perform as well as they have done over the past twelve months.""
""Our brands are performing better and people are more conscious about brands, consumer service and marketing support, so I see the recipe pretty much as we have experienced over the last 12 months.""
Stewart said S&amp;N expected to continue to supply beer to most of Inntrepeneur's 3,000 tied pubs, despite the fact its exclusive beer supply contract with the company expires in March 1998.
Pub company Inntrepreneur is jointly owned by Grand Metropolitan and Australian brewer Foster's.
""We do anticipate we will hold the majority of the brands based on our brand performance through those outlets. You have got to remember that publicans have traded with these brands for many years and they will not wish to upset their customers, particularly when the brands are performing as well as they are.""

5,"Unilever Plc stirred up the world chemicals industry Tuesday with surprise news that it plans to sell most of its speciality chemicals businesses.
The announcement of the massive disposal programme, which analysts said could net up to five billion pounds ($8.17 billion) for the Anglo-Dutch group, sparked a rash of speculation about potential buyers.
The four businesses, National Starch &amp; Chemical Co., Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield, had total sales of around three billion pounds ($4.9 billion) last year and employ nearly 16,000 people in 35 countries.
Analysts said the move, which could free Unilever up for a major acquisition in its core food, detergents and personal product businesses, was well-timed.
The company is taking advantage of a shake-up in chemicals as Europe comes to grips with overcapacity and increasing competition from the United States and Asia by swapping assets and disposing of non-core operations.
Businesses like Unilever's are particularly attractive, offering higher margins and less volatile performance than industrial chemicals. With profit margins of more than 14 percent, Unilever's businesses ""are at the good end of the range,"" said Williams de Broe analyst Peter Cartwright.
""This is a highly saleable and attractive portfolio,"" Kleinwort Benson analyst Jeremy Chantry said. He added that the businesses were likely to be sold ""in big pieces.""
Another analyst, who asked not to be named, said U.S.-based National Starch, which makes industrial adhesives, resins and speciality starches, could fetch 1.3 to 1.5 times its annual sales.
The Quest fragrances and flavorings business and the Unichema natural oils businesses, both based in the Netherlands, might be worth 1.5 times their annual turnover.
With no obvious buyer for the whole package, speculation centred on possible interest for the different segments.
Williams de Broe's Cartwright said industrial adhesives and resins could both be a target for Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries Plc , which wants to buy lighter chemicals operations and move away from industrial products.
Analysts said ICI, which has little debt, could also be interested in the petroleum and plastics catalysts business of British-based Crosfield.
Another analyst said National Starch could interest other U.S. firms. ""A lot of the big processors in the States, like Cargill, make raw starch and haven't moved on into the value-added chain, which is what National Starch is in. Those big food processors may be interested in that,"" he added.
Switzerland's Roche Holding AG spent $1.1 billion last week buying flavors group Tastemaker. Another major player in the sector, International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. of the United States, said last year it was not interested in buying another flavors company, but it could be attracted by Quest's investment in biotechnology.
Unichema, whose products include lubricants and ingredients for polymers, soap and skincare products, might be of interest to one of the five or six major players in this segment. They include Witco Corp. of the United States and the German groups Henkel KGaA and Degussa AG.

5,"Yorkshire-based chemicals group Allied Colloids Plc said on Tuesday that its strategy of growing organically remained unchanged, despite the $390 million acquisition of CPS Chemical Co Inc of the U.S.
Chief executive David Farrar said Allied Colloids ""has not been acquisitive"" by tradition.
""We saw this as an opportunity that does not come along very often,"" Farrar said in a telephone interview with Reuters following the announcement of the purchase and interim results.  
""This is a good strategic fit for us. CPS are in the same business as us, the chemistry is similar. We have had a long association with them and have been major customers of theirs for eight years.""
The move will substantially increase Allied Colloids' sales in the U.S, which already accounts for more than 30 percent of its annual turnover. CPS, which has plants in Arkansas and New Jersey, had sales of $157 million last year, some 75 percent of which were in the domestic market.  
Farrar said Allied, which provides chemicals for a wide range of industries including paper-making, minerals, textiles, oil and pharmaceuticals, remained committed to expansion in other key marekts, notably Europe and the Far East. But this would be achieved ""by organic growth.""
Allied Colloids believes the acquisition of CPS, which is partly being financed by a two-for-seven rights issue to raise 173 million stg, will be earnings enhancing in its first full financial yuear. It said it also expected to benefit from substantial U.S. tax credits.  
Farrar said the combined group would have a workforce of around 3,500 following the addition of CPS' 360 employees. He said CPS, which makes chemical intermediates and finished polymers for industry, will complement Allied in a number of areas, notably in coatings, paper and pollution control.
It will also add to Allied's technological base and provide new products to market through its existing 400-strong salesforce.
The rights issue and acquisition were accompanied by an upbeat statement on prospects, with Allied Colloids predicting a continued improvement in second-half sales and profits.  
First-half pretax profits rose 3.8 percent to 21.1 million stg on sales up 9 percent at 207.6 million stg.
Farrar said sharp falls in raw material costs earlier this year started to feed into second-quarter results, but their full impact would be felt in the second half. He predicted that gross profit margins would increase by 1 percentage point in the second half from the 37.5 percent seen in the first half and the 36.2 achieved in the 12 months to March.
Allied is also predicting a further pick-up in sales growth in the second half of the year, implying full-year sales of more than 430 million stg compared with 393 million a year earlier.

5,"Shares in perennial bid favourite Zeneca Group Plc spiralled higher once more on Thursday, but analysts said it was on the thinnest of pretexts.
The stock touched a new record of 17.25 pounds during the morning session, with the rise once more triggered by speculation about the intentions of Swiss drugs giant Roche Holding AG. -- hotly tipped by takeover theorists as the only company rich enough to buy Zeneca.
News that Roche had named Franz Humer as chief operating officer combined with talk in the press that Humer is keen to ensure Roche does ""not play second fiddle"" to his old employer Glaxo Wellcome fuelled the latest rise, traders said.
With few people willing to sell Zeneca stock in case they miss out on any takeover, which could be worth $30 billion, the stock is being continually squeezed higher.
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST) analyst Peter Laing said Zeneca shares, which have gained 37 percent this year, are now at ""eye-popping"" levels. SGST believes that a hostile bid is implausible at current valuations, and, without this, the stock's current rating is increasingly hard to justify.
""Is it valid for a stock which is only two-thirds a drug stock and the rest agro-chemicals and specialty chemicals to be on the same premium as Pfizer?"" said Laing, who argued that the current gains are a story of ""supply and demand.""
Cash-rich Roche is widely believed to want to make a large acquisition, both to reassert its position as number one in Switzerland and to counteract the shortfall in new drugs coming through the industry's pipeline.
But some analysts and industry executives believe that Zeneca would not necessarily be its chosen target.
One industry source said he believed Roche would be much more interested in the U.S. company Schering-Plough Corp, which had a similar market capitalization to Zeneca. He said Roche had eyed Schering Plough on a number of occasions.
Schering-Plough would offer Roche a much stronger footing in the key U.S. market than Zeneca, and it would plug gaps in Roche's existing infrastrucure, offering the Swiss group badly-needed muscle in the non-hospital and U.S. over-the-counter sectors.
However, analysts said Zeneca had a more attractive pipeline of new drugs than Schering-Plough. And as the world's second-biggest cancer drug company after Bristol Myers Squibb Co it would also boost Roche in a key therapeutic area.
""I am quite sure that at the right price several companies would like to acquire Zeneca,"" said Panmure Gordon analyst Robin Gilbert, adding that good quality medium-to-large businesses like Zeneca and Schering-Plough are few and far between.
But Gilbert said Zeneca, which is ""firing on all cylinders"" since its split from chemicals group ICI Plc in 1993, is determined to remain independent.
""They believe they have a future as an independent company, and obviously they don't agree with the size philosphy of people like Glaxo Wellcome,"" Gilbert said.

5,"The world's biggest prescription drugs company, Glaxo Wellcome Plc, announced an 18 percent leap in pre-tax profits on Thursday, but said life would be tougher after its best-selling drug loses its U.S. patent in July.
Pre-tax profits climbed to 2.964 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) from 2.505 billion, bang in the middle of analysts' expectations. Sales rose 9 percent to 8.341 billion pounds, and shareholders were rewarded with a 13 percent rise in the dividend to 34.0 pence.
Shares in Glaxo Wellcome, which slipped back to a low of 981 pence at one stage, were down just 7 1/2 pence to 10.27 1/2 pounds as analysts responded positively to a meeting with the company. Traders said some profit-taking had been expected after the stock touched a record 10.63 on Wednesday.
Sales of gastric ulcer treatment Zantac fell 14 percent last year, but at 1.931 billion pounds it continued to be the world's biggest-selling drug, a spot it has held since 1986. Zantac has single-handedly transformed Glaxo, which merged with rival Wellcome in 1995, into a huge international player.
Sales of its second-biggest seller, herpes treatment Zovirax which has already lost most of its key patents, were steady at 812 million pounds.
Glaxo warned that the best it could hope for over the next two years would be to ""at least maintain"" its profits at the 1996 level.
""The tough period is mid-1997 to mid-1998 when Zantac will come under severe generic pressure in the U.S.,"" deputy chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Sykes said in a telephone interview with Reuters.
But he added: ""If you take Zantac out we have a 6.4 billion pound business growing at 14 percent. That underlying growth is a very clear indication of the strength of the group going forward.""
Sykes noted that sales of Zantac fell by 324 million pounds last year, while a portfolio of newer products launched since 1990 saw sales rise by 650 million pounds to 2.0 billion pounds.
""Our responsibility is to grow those new products to maintain these two (sales) lines in balance as much as possible. It is a balancing act,"" he said.
The best performers included Glaxo Wellcome's rejuvenated HIV and AIDS treatments. Retrovir and Epivir are at the cornerstone of new cocktails of drugs which have shown startling success in reducing the levels of the virus in the blood to virtually undetectable levels, giving Glaxo Wellcome the lion's share of a rapidly expanding market.
""Today we have 57 percent of the AIDS market and I don't see why we won't continue to be a very major player,"" Sykes said.
Other big sellers included asthma drugs Serevent and Flixotide and migraine drug Imigran, which saw sales in the U.S. alone leap by 69 percent last year.
Despite persistent speculation that Glaxo Wellcome will get onto the acquisition trail again as soon as its debt levels allow, Sykes told Reuters there had been a clear dissipation of the pressures for mega-mergers. He said Glaxo Wellcome's future expansion was likely to be ""incremental.""
""The pressures of the early 1990s have changed somewhat in the big markets. The bigger companies get, the more difficult it is to buy them or merge, so the way forward will be much more looking at regional and local opportunities and building these as opportunities come along,"" he said.

5,"British Biotech Plc published further evidence on Monday that its cancer drug Marimastat worked, but analysts said there was still a long way to go before its potential as a blockbuster product can be confirmed.
Shares in the company slipped back after its keenly-awaited announcement appeared to provide comfort for both bulls and bears on Marimastat, a new class of cancer drug which some predict could one day have sales of $4 billion a year.
The stock was down 14 1/2 pence at 217 pence in early afternoon trading. But analysts noted that it rose sharply last week ahead of publication, while the decision by Morgan Grenfell to sell a sizeable chunk of its holding on October 29 had mopped up much of the buying interest in advance.
Oxford-based British Biotech used a cancer conference in Vienna to make a number of presentations on trials of the drug in gastric, colo-rectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancer.
It said the studies, based on cancer patients who continued taking the drug after the 28-day period needed for Phase II trials, confirmed Marimastat's ability to reduce the rate of rise of cancer antigens, one measure of how much cancer is present in the body. It also provided evidence of succcess in gastric cancer, where a large scale trial is now underway.
Some analysts said there was little new in the statement, which was largely a confirmation of Phase II, or intermediate stage, data published in May.
""Those who were sceptical in May will remain sceptical and those who were bullish in May will remain bullish,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Finance director James Noble said the company had been deliberately cautious in its comments to avoid raising false hopes among cancer sufferers. Nevertheless he told Reuters that ""In many ways I think this is the most impressive data since the company was floated.
One of the bulls, Greig Middleton analyst John Savin, said the real news was hidden in presentations made by doctors at the Vienna conference. He said that despite the ""mishmash"" of data from the trials, which covered 381 patients, there was ""very compelling"" evidence that Marimastat had improved chances of survival.
""On this information today we can say that...37 percent (of patients) had a real overall response which improved their survival chance significantly,"" Savin said.
However, others expressed disappointment that British Biotech failed to provide more detailed analysis of side effects caused by Marimastat. British Bitoech confirmed that it caused joint pain, mainly in the arm and shoulder, with around 30 percent of patients affected after three to five months.
Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said the side effect profile will be crucial to Marimastat's potential. ""Drugs become top sellers because of their side effect profile rather than because of their efficacy profile,"" he said.
Noble played down concerns about side effects, saying ""they are not a serious problem. They are reversible."" He said patients who suffer badly will be able to interrupt their treatment from time to time without any adverse impact.
Analysts pointed out that no real estimate of just how big Marimastat will be could be made until Phase III trials were completed. This means investors will have to wait until 1998 at the very earliest for hard evidence that their optimism about Marimastat and British Biotech is well founded.

5,"Shareholders in tiny British healthcare group Enviromed Plc staged a bloodless coup on Friday, toppling the embattled company's board.
The gentlemanly storming of the barricades around Enviromed's Knightsbridge headquarters was led by Ron Zwanziger, chief executive officer of Enviromed's biggest shareholder, U.S. company Selfcare Inc.
Zwanziger has watched the value of Selfcare's 29 percent stake in Enviromed dwindle as the share price plummeted from around 112 pence per share in December 1994 to around 25 pence, in line with a collapse in the group's profitability.
Selfcare, which produces tests for pregnancy and infectious diseases, asked shareholders to back its plans to remove four members of the board, led by managing director Thomas Murphy, at an extraordinary meeting on Friday.
But after weeks of charge and counter-charge by both sides, the expected showdown in the unlikely setting of Dean's Yard, next to Westminster Abbey, turned out to be a sedate rubber-stamping exercise.
The board of Enviromed, which produces specialist enzymes and diagnostic equipment, spiked the guns of its opponents by conceding defeat after proxy votes showed 49 percent backing for Selfcare and just under 39 percent supporting the status quo.
A brief show of hands was sufficent to confirm the handover of power and the new board, with Selfcare's Zwanziger as non-executive chairman, was already holding its first meeting as individual shareholders continued to drift in.
This was Zwanziger's second attempt to get rid of the board, which he quit in April 1995 over differences involving a joint venture between Selfcare and Enviromed. Resolutions demanding the board step down were withdrawn just before the start of another extraordinary general meeting in February 1996.
Zwanziger accused Enviromed of eroding shareholder value through poor management and of holding firesales of assets, including the disposal of a dental distribution business and veterinary diagnostic operation, as it sought to cut debts.
In turn Enviromed accused Zwanziger of trying to gain control of the company ""via the back door"", and challenged him to launch a full takeover bid.
Enviromed's value began to plunge in December 1994, the month that Murphy was appointed, as a pretax profit of 2.2 million stg in the year to September 1994 turned into a loss of 8.2 million stg a year later. The company's market capitalization fell from around 28 million stg to just over 6.0 million.
Murphy vehemently rejected blame for the collapse, saying he had inherited a pile of problems he and other board members had worked hard to resolve.
One of the new board's first goals will be to appoint a finance director. In a letter to shareholders ahead of the extraordinary meeting Zwanziger said the new board would focus on the development of the enzyme buisness Biozyme which it said was already profitable.

5,"Shares in one of Britain's best-performing biotechnology stocks plunged on Friday after it announced that some trials linked to its main product could have been mishandled.
Scottish-based Shield Diagnostics Group Plc said parts of a U.S. clinical trial which it hopes will help prove that it has a blockbuster heart attack predictor on its hands had been mishandled and could produce ""misleading conclusions.""
Shares in Shield dropped 140 pence to 665 pence on the news. The stock had hit an all time high of 928 pence just ahead of the announcement, a gain of more than 560 percent since the start of the year.
The company is developing a diagnostic test for a blood-clotting agent, known as Activated Factor Twelve (AFT), which it hopes will be a much more accurate predictor of the likelihood of coronary heart disease and heart attacks than cholesterol levels.
Some analysts believe that the test is a potential blockbuster, which could easily overtake the $500 million a year spent on cholesterol tests.
Shield has been waiting for publication of a number of long-running surveys which are tracking the incidence of heart attacks and trying to establish links with different factors in the blood, including AFT.
A doctor involved in one major trial, the U.S. ARIC study, which has taken regular blood samples from 16,000 people over more than ten years, wrote to Shield on Thursday to say mishandling and storage of early blood samples could distort analysis of the results.
In an interview with Reuters, Shield's technical director Peter Foster said the company still expected to have test kits on the market this year.
""We don't see it as a problem at all and we will continue with our timetable for the commercialisation of the test,"" Foster said.
He said data from a British study of 3,000 individuals by researchers based at St Bartholomew's hospital in London ""is there and getting stronger."" Initial results from the St Bartholomew study published on February 21 added to ""the body of consistent positive data from a number of clinical sites"" which back the link between AFT and heart disease, Shield said.
At least one analyst however criticised the company for allowing its share price to race ahead when ""they don't even know if the product correlates to a use that a regulatory authority would approve.""
Thomas Geimer, biotechnology analyst at Henry Cooke Lumsden, added that ""the product may be valid and be fine,"" but he said the problems with the U.S. trial showed the need for investors to be ""very selective in this market.""

5,"Young drug discovery group Vanguard Medica Plc said on Thursday it could wait longer than expected before seeking a fresh cash injection.
Vanguard floated on the stock exchange in May, raising 46.4 million stg to fund its pipeline, which includes migraine and kidney failure drugs.
""We said we'd be expecting to seek more finance in 1998, but we took in more money than we'd expected and may have scope for going on longer,"" commercial director Nick Heightman said in a telephone interview following interim results.  
Vanguard said on Thursday that its pretax loss in the six months to June 30 widened to 3.7 million stg from 1.8 million a year earlier, largely due to the cost of moving migraine drug VML 251 and anti-inflammatory drug VML 295 through trials.
Heightman, who joined Vanguard from drug giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc, said the company had expected to announce results of large-scale intermediate, or Phase II, trials on the migraine drug by July 1997.
""I think we are going to be able to do that in the first quarter, so we are about a quarter ahead,"" he said.  
Analysts say the migraine drug, which is being developed in cooperation with SmithKline Beecham Plc accounts for around half of Vanguard's current stock market valuation.
Some studies have shown it may be more potent than the current market leader, Glaxo Wellcome's Imigran, although Heightman said direct comparisons cannot be made for another 18 months.
He said another Vanguard drug, VML 252, which promises to tackle bone damage suffered by patients with severe kidney problems, is now ""running neck and neck"" with the migraine treatment.  
Although VDL 252 is currently in Phase I trials, Heightman said it is likely to progress more quickly through trials than the migraine drug.
""Its effectiveness is particularly easy to measure. You can quickly tell if you are having an effect,"" he told Reuters. Heightman believes both drugs could be on the market in the year 2000 if trials continue to go well.
Despite the positive news from the company, Vanguard shares dropped 5 1/2 pence to 495 pence on Thursday.  
Greig Middleton analyst Julia Dickson expressed surprise at the fall, saying the market ""doesn't seem to understand the company.""
""We think it is very cheap and I am surprised it is off,"" Dickson said, adding that the company's statement was ""very positive"" and Vanguard's meeting with analysts on Thursday showed drugs are progressing even faster than the company has officialy acknowledged.
Lehman Brothers' analyst Ian Smith said the ""share price adequately reflects the value of the current portfolio, with some excellent opportunities,"" particualrly in migraine and kidney-related problems.
He said in the medium- to long-term, the value will depend on Vanguard's ability to attract further partnerships like that with SmithKline Beecham, a cornerstone of Vanguard's growth strategy.

5,"Avalon Oil Plc said on Monday that it had decided to look to London for funding of its oil exploration joint venture with FAO Gazprom because British investors were ahead of the U.S. in investing in Russian projects.
""The London investment community is probably five years ahead of the U.S. investment community when it comes to Russia,"" Avalon Oil chairman John Wieczorek told Reuters in an interview.
""We couldn't see any Russian ventures which have been taken public in the States.""
Oklahoma-based Avalon said earlier on Monday that it intended to seek a listing on Britain's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) to raise funds for Stimul, a joint venture with a Gazprom subsidiary which will exploit oil reserves at Orenburg in southern Russia.
The U.S. company is believed to want to raise around 35 million pounds via a placing, which will finance its 49 percent stake in Stimul.
Avalon is following an increasingly well-worn path. Other companies such as Melrose, JKX Oil and Gas and Dana xxx have all become involved in projects to develop immense and largely untapped gas and oil reserves in the former Soviet Union, which some say could rival reserves in the Middle East.
Wieczorek said Gazprom, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's natural gas production, was keen to use Avalon's portfolio of new technology.
The two have been working together since 1993, and Stimul alrady produces 2,850 barrels of oil a day, which it hopes to booost to 18,500 barrels a day next year.
""Gazprom were attracted by access to western technology,""said Wieczorek. ""They have a tremendous history of gas production but not oil production.""
Avalon has already introduced different drawing fluids for the extraction of oil which do not damage the reservoirs, and is about to bring in its system of flow drilling, which limits damage during the drilling phase and allows production to start while drilling is going on. This will be the fist time the technique has been employed in Russia.
""You can produce more quickly and you are able to produce at a higher rate. It also reduces the cost of the well,"" said Wieczorek.
Without more sophisticated production methods the reserves at Orenburg, which Wieczorek said are similar in scale to the Nelson field in the North Sea, could not be exploited economicallly.
Under current plans Stimul will be able to exploit the site by drilling around 160 horizontal producing wells and 50 vertical wells over the next six years. The original Russian plans called for drilling more than 3000 wells.
Wieczorek said the Orenburg project would be ""a jumping-off point for other projects in Russia.""
He said the company had been looking at three other oil fields, one nearby and two in different regions of Russia. ""I feel very confident that we'll be able to add these to our future agenda,"" he said.
Wieczorek said Avalon was unlikely to have to seek further funding beyond the initial placing.
""I don't think we'll have to come back for more because this programme should be cashflow positive in 1999, so from that point of view it should be self-funding,"" he added.

5,"Dominion Resources Inc. ended a day of speculation Wednesday by declaring it might bid for British regional utility East Midlands Electricity Plc in a deal that could be worth about $2 billion.
The bid would mark the lastest in a a line of U.S. utilities companies seeking to buy into the privatised British power supply business.
But in a statement published after the close of London trading, Richmond, Va.-based Dominion, which owns electric utility Virginia Power, said it would not make an offer at a price ""much in excess"" of East Midlands' closing price.
Sources close to the situation said that if the price ""runs away tomorrow, then Dominion will run away.""
East Midlands' share price leaped 70.5 British pence to close at 608 pence ($9.97) on Wednesday, lifting the Nottingham, England-based group's value to more than 1.2 billion pounds ($1.97 billion), as rumour swirled around it.
Dominion stock gained 75 cents to $39.75 on the New York Stock Exchage.
The sources said East Midlands had already cut costs ""to the bone,"" adding that ""the comapny needs investment to grow again.""
East Midlands declined to comment on the Dominion statement.
Rumours that another bid was about to claim one of the few remaining independent regional electricity companies in England and Wales sent their shares soaring.
Besides East Midlands, Yorkshire Electricity Group Plc.'s shares rose 15.5 pence to 754 ($12.37), while Southern Electric Plc. jumped 21.5 pence to 669 pence ($10.97), and London Electricity Plc. gained 12.5 to 618 pence ($10.14).
The names of any likely bidders remained a mystery.
Dominion Resources is a medium-sized company in the United States, with a market capitalisation of around $6.6 billion and annual sales of around $4.7 billion.
In addition to Virginia Power, its main subsidiary, Dominion has a number of joint generation ventures in the United States and internationally, notably in South America. It also has an interest in gas and real estate.
If Dominion's board proceeds, the bid would be the latest in a series of U.S. companies that has turned up recently in the privatised British power supply business. Last week, a unit of U.S.-based CalEnergy launched a hostile 650 million pound ($1.07 billion) bid for Northern Electric Plc.
Northern Electric, which is due to release strong half-year results early in an attempt to attract a higher bid, saw its shares rise 1.5 pence to 634 pence ($10.40) on Thursday, adding to recent sharp gains.
Out of the 12 privatised cash-rich regional electric companies, seven have already changed ownership -- four of them to U.S. companies.

25,"Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said on Monday his country viewed as frivolous and ""absolutely unacceptable"" Russian threats of economic reprisals for Prague's entry into NATO.
""We consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance with bilateral (Czech-Russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context,"" the Czech news agency CTK quoted Zieleniec as saying.
On Sunday, Moscow's ambassador to Prague Nikolai Ryabov warned the Czech Republic that key bilateral agreements with Russia might be jeopardised if it joined NATO.
Ryabov told Russia's NTV commercial television that the former Warsaw Pact member's entry into the western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for Moscow.
""It would be a real blow for the Russian economy,"" he said.
The ambassador went on to hint that Moscow could reconsider economic deals with Prague if it went ahead.
""Agreements fundamental to the Czech Republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face (if Prague joined NATO),"" said Ryabov, former head of Russia's central electoral commission.
Zieleniec told CTK that Ryabov's statement made it clear why the Czechs wanted to join western organisations.
""This type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important, at the earliest, to become a member of the key western political, economic, and security organisations,"" it quoted Zieleniec as saying.
He said he thought the ambassador's interview on Russian television was mostly for media consumption.
The Czechs, Poland and Hungary are expected to be named among the first former-Soviet Bloc countries to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid.
Russian officials have intensified their rhetoric against NATO expansion plans, which they say threaten Russia's security, in the run-up to a summit in Helsinki this week between President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. Bill Clinton.
Moscow hopes to use the issue as a lever with which to win concessions from the U.S.-led alliance on arms control agreements and other security and economic issues.
After the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total Czech trade turnover with Russia grew 9.8 percent in 1996 to $2.8 billion.
But 1996 trade was heavily weighted in Russia's favour with Czech exports to Russia at $694 million and while imports from Russia were $2.1 billion.
Czechs are still dependent on Russia for natural gas and most of its crude oil, but Prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long-term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from Norway.
Last year, the Czechs opened the Ingolstadt spur in the Transalpine crude pipeline from the Adriatic Sea, providing direct access to crude from the Middle East.
The Czech power company CEZ a.s. is also dependent on Russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at Dukovany, but the company is expected to take U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at Temelin by the end of the century.
The Czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly Soviet-era equipment with Western-made, NATO compatible goods.

25,"Czech Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, a deputy premier and leader of a junior partner in the ruling coalition, quit the government and parliament on Tuesday for falsely using an academic title, the CTK news agency said.
Another member of parliament from a coalition party also quit parliament for the same reason, while three other deputies admitted using false titles but did not step down.
Kalvoda, aged 43, resigned for falsely claiming he was a Doctor of Law amid a growing row over the academic credentials of Czech politicians after deputies began questioning whether they were all genuine.
""Yes, (Kalvoda resigned) and he delivered his resignation to the president,"" Mariana Cerna of the parliament's press office told Reuters.
Officials of Kalvoda's party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), were not immediately available for comment, and it was not yet clear who would take Kalvoda's place in the cabinet or what his status would be within his party.
He told the house however that there would be no changes in the party, CTK reported.
ODA's press department said it would not comment until a meeting of party leaders on Wednesday.
Kalvoda, who headed the most pro-business party in the coalition, often bumped heads with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on issues such as speeding up the deregulation of heating prices and rents and lowering taxes.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pavla Jurkova, a member of another coalition party, the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), resigned her seat in the 200-seat lower house -- where the centre-right coalition has 99 seats -- for falsely claiming a law doctorate.
Meanwhile two members of Vaclav Klaus's senior party in the three-member coalition, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), also admitted today that their law doctorates, used in campaign material earlier this year, were false, CTK said.
However Anna Roeschova and Ondrej Zemina had not resigned their seats, CTK reported.
Also staying put in parliament was a member of the opposition Social Democrats, Marie Noveska, after admitting she had not finished university but still used the title doctor of law.

25,"Czech Unipetrol a.s. on Wednesday announced a long-awaited plan to convert shares in Kaucuk a.s. and Chemopetrol a.s. into Unipetrol shares.
In a joint statement the boards of Chemopetrol, Kaucuk and Unipetrol, the country's new petrochemical holding company, said they agreed to swap one Chemopetrol share for between 1.05 to 1.20 Unipetrol shares, and one Kaucuk share for between 1.10 to 1.25 Unipetrol shares.
The plan, to complete the complex partial privatisation of the two largest Czech petrochemical concerns, was agreed at a meeting on Tuesday of the respective boards, but an exact ratio must still be approved by general shareholders meetings.
Kaucuk and Chemopetrol shares have traded virtually level for months as investors hoped for possible arbitrage trades if either firm's shares got an advantage in the swap.
Ahead of the news on Wednesday, Kaucuk shares were fixed 11 crowns above Tuesday's close on the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) at 1,105, while Chemopetrol finished the PSE's Wednesday trading session 12 crowns higher at 1,106.
The Unipetrol statement said the ratio range was determined by ""the current results of appraising the assets and liabilities of the involved companies.""
Equities analysts said that because the announced range of the conversion still allowed for overlap in the final decision and did not give a clear advantage to one company's shares, immediate arbitrage possibilities were slim.
But they said that the fact that the boards were nearing a decision on a very complicated issue should give a mild boost to shares in Kaucuk and Chemopetrol.
""I don't see any arbitrage opportunity at this moment,"" said Patria Finance's Miroslav Nosal. ""But now that the exchange ratio is being announced, I believe it will help the shares in both companies.""
Tomas Michalek, at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment Prague, agreed that the movement toward a decision would be a plus to the shares.
""What is positive is that they agreed on a ratio (range). It's important so that both companies can finally be folded into Unipetrol and more foreign capital can come in,"" Michalek said.
Under a complicated privatisation of the Czech petrochemical industry, Kaucuk and Chemopetrol's refining operations were merged into a subsidiary of the newly-created Unipetrol last year called Ceska Rafinerska a.s..
Unipetrol, in which the government currently holds a 100 percent stake, has a 51 percent stake in Ceska Rafinerska,
The IOC consortium -- comprising U.S. Du Pont de Nemours unit Conoco, Royal Dutch/Shell, and Italy's Agip SpA -- acquired a 49 percent stake in Rafinerska under agreement with the government last year.
The share swap would complete the transfer of the rest of Kaucuk and Chemopetrol as subsidiaries under Unipetrol, which acts as a holding company, and would dilute the state's 100 percent stake in Unipetrol.' -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003

25,"Czech President Vaclav Havel, the only man who can smoke next to militant Hollywood anti-smoker Barbra Streisand, is facing a life without his beloved cigarettes after surgery revealed a cancerous lung.
Havel's heavy smoking is a fixture of his Bohemian intellectual image, but it is widely believed that it caused the malignant tumour which was radically removed on Monday.
It certainly startled some Czechs who awoke on Tuesday to a huge headline in the tabloid Blesk which simply bleated ""CANCER"" next to an archive picture of a happily-smoking Havel.
But just as Boris Yeltsin's multiple by-pass heart surgery will hardly dry up a Muscovite's taste for vodka, which many blamed for the Russian president's ills, Havel's surgery probably will not cause chain-smoking Czechs to kick the habit.
""Ooh, I should quit,"" said Hana Haskova, a 19-year-old student reacting to news of Havel's cancer. ""Well, I probably won't, but I'll be forced to think about it when I smoke.""
Doctors said the surgery, which cost the 60-year-old Havel half of his right lung, gave him good prospects for a full recovery, and he might return to work soon after the new year.
But his spokesman said that Havel, a multiple-pack-a-day man, will probably be limited to being a ""holiday smoker lighting up once a week with afternoon coffee.""
The world sees Havel like this -- the mustached but impish Bohemian philospher-playwright crumpled in a sweater, cigarette smoke pouring from his fingers as he mulls life's problems.
His dissident musings from a prison cell won the respect of the western world and helped spark Prague's non-violent 1989 ""Velvet Revolution"" over communism.
""Vaclav Havel is the only person who can smoke in my presence,"" said Barbra Streisand, one of America's prominent anti-smokers, at a Washington picnic last year in honour of the visiting Czech President.
The unlikely rise from prison to Prague Castle made Havel one of the most famous unabashed public smokers.
But news of Havel's cancer confirmed what many here feared when he entered hospital last week with an alleged case of pnuemonia -- his ubiquitous smoking caught up with him.
Czech surgeon Dr. Pavel Pafko said after performing the operation that it would be difficult to pinpoint smoking as the primary cause of Havel's cancer.
""The composition of this tumour is problematic in relation to smoking. You can't definitely tell,"" Pafko told reporters.
But to many Czechs, the cause was clear:
""It has to be the smoking,"" was the oft-repeated phrase of workers in central Prague, many of them smokers.
""Stopping now won't help anyway. I was smoking before you were born,"" said Karel, 43, a maintenence man puffing away over beer in one of the hundreds of Prague's smoke-blanketed pubs.
Dr. Pavko said Havel smoked one last pre-surgery cigarette with Jan Strasky, a chain smoker who happens also to be minister of health, whose warning on smoking's link to cancer is on every legally-sold pack of cigarettes in the country.
Havel, as many Czechs, came of age smoking heavy Communist cigarettes, and has moved to more expensive western brands.
A country of 10 million people smokes 23 billion cigarettes each year. Consumption has grown from five cigarettes per day to more than six averaged out for every man, woman, and child.
Amid an influx of western brands -- U.S. Philip Morris bought a controlling stake in the former monopoly state tobacco packager, and has made Marlboro a status symbol -- Havel vetoed measures to regulate public smoking and cigarette advertising.
The president once also was blamed for a nuclear alert by lighting up while touring a power plant, but an official re-enactment of the incident declared it was photographers' flashes, not Havel's smoke, which set off the alarm.

25,"The Czechs, a small nation with an impressive history of Oscar success, on Tuesday showered praise on Jan and Zdenek Sverak for bringing home a coveted Academy Award for their film ""Kolya"".
The story of an ageing bachelor's reawakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 Velvet Revolution won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in the ceremony late on Monday.
President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident playwright under communism who acted in films himself, sent a victory telegram to the Sveraks in Los Angeles.
""I am pleased with the great success of your film. I am happy that after many years a Czech film has again received the Oscar,"" Havel's press office quoted the telegram as saying.
Czech media also applauded for the win for the director Jan, 31, and his scriptwriter father Zdenek, who played the bachelor in Kolya.
""The Oscar Goes to Prague"" shouted the capital's daily Vecernik Praha.
It was the first Czech foreign language film Oscar since Jiri Menzel's won in 1968 with ""Closely Observed Trains"" one of a spate of admired movies known worldwide as the ""Czech New Wave"".
Elmar Klos from Slovakia -- now independent, but then part of Czechoslovakia -- won the best foreign film Oscar in 1966 for ""The Shop On Main Street"".
The Czech Republic, with a population of 10 million, also lays claim to director Milos Forman, a Prague native who made the Oscar-winning ""Amadeus"" in 1985 and ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" in 1976 after emigrating to the United States.
Forman failed to pick up best director honours on Monday after his nomination for ""The People Versus Larry Flint"", after winning a Golden Globe and the Berlin's Golden Bear for the film.
The Sverak team made their first international splash in 1992, when the post-war drama-comedy ""Elementary School"" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost. Zdenek is currently working on the team's first original English-language script.
Critics say Kolya, a politically-charged comedy-drama which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech New Wave.
""The film is about how the understanding between nations is much more important than the power,"" Sverak told reporters backstage after winning the Oscar.
Earlier this month Kolya won the Czech version of the Oscar, the Czech Lev (Lion), for best picture, but Zdenek Sverak was edged out for the best Czech actor award by Bolek Polivka, a popular cabaret comedian.
Kolya was favoured to take home the Oscar after winning Hollywood's Golden Globe for best foreign language film in January.

25,"Volkswagen AG's Czech unit Skoda Automobilova a.s. said on Thursday that it should nearly double its worldwide production capacity, making half a million cars yearly by the end of the century.
At a news conference detailing last year's results -- which showed a swing to a small profit after a 1995 loss -- Chief Financial Officer Volkhard Kohler said the former communist car maker had laid the foundation for strong global expansion.
""The half million (cars produced yearly) volume is no Utopia for us, we are sure we can achieve that,"" he said.
""We have to globalise,"" said Kohler, who is to be re-assigned soon after helping lead Skoda's transformation.
Skoda posted 1996 net profit of 163 million crowns after a loss of 1.62 billion crowns in 1995, when it ploughed much of its cash flow into building a new mid-sized platform for its Octavia line which premiered last autumn.
""In the next and future years we don't count on any losses, only profits,"" said Kohler, declining a more specific forecast.
Skoda's total turnover comprised roughly 3.4 percent of Volkswagen Group's worldwide take in 1996. VW built up a 70 percent stake in the Czech company in 1995 since joining in on its privatisation earlier in the decade.
Officials said potential domestic production capacity would be filled when it reaches an expected 340,000 cars this year.
Expansion is to come from opening new production elsewhere, such as its assembly line in Poznan, Poland -- which has a capacity for 15,000 to 20,000 cars.
Total sales rose 34 percent last year to 58.9 billion crowns, while unit sales were up 24 percent to 279,363 cars, almost entirely comprised of Skoda's compact Felicia line.
Production is forecast to increase 30 percent this year, as the Octavia range comes fully on stream.
The century-old Skoda, based north of Prague, posted robust sales growth of 47 percent in developed countries of western Europe, which accounted for nearly a third of total turnover.
Meanwhile, sales to central and eastern Europe, excluding Skoda's home market, rose 78 percent, and domestic turnover was up 24 percent and comprised 45 percent of sales.
Sales and marketing director Detlef Wittig said that the company hoped to hold on to its 50 percent domestic market share while continuing to focus on Poland and Russia for growth and making gains in new western European markets.
""In highly developed Western markets we have broken through with the Felicia range,"" Wittig said, stressing that Skoda's marketing had concentrated on the new quality of the brand which was once the butt of many western jokes.
Unit sales in two of its largest western European export markets Germany and Britain showed growth of just two percent, but sales to France, Italy, and Denmark showed double-digit growth, and sales to nearby Austria doubled to 9,457 units.
Meanwhile it had a lower turnover in Asia and South America of 10 percent as it directed exports toward stronger demand in Europe. The company has yet to attack North America.
Despite average double-digit wage increases and Czech average annual inflation last year of 8.8 percent, personnel costs grew only 6.8 percent, as the workforce grew 6.9 percent to 17,992 employees.
Skoda exports account for roughly five percent of total Czech exports. Kohler said that further increases in productivity and efficiency would counter the strong Czech crown and increase Skoda's share to seven or eight percent.
""We can say that the ground floor (at Skoda) has already been finished, but it now depends on our colleagues to make a nice skyscraper,"" the outgoing Kohler said.

25,"Ducking into a crumbling production office on a rainy Prague street, they don't look like two of the hottest European properties in the film world.
You couldn't tell it by their workplace -- a stuffy dark cave in the basement of an early 20th century block of flats -- hardly enough room for the two of them amid stacks of film cans and mounds of remnants that didn't make the cut.
Still, life keeps getting brighter for the father and son team who have become the de facto storytellers of bittersweet Czech post-communist nostalgia.
Director Jan Sverak is 31 and wears ""John Lennon"" glasses, while his grey-bearded father Zdenek is screenwriter and star. Can we call Dad the ""Czech Sean Connery"" as so many do?
""Call (Connery) the American Zdenek Sverak,"" Jan says, explaining that Czechs never knew who James Bond was back in the days of the Cold War.
Together the two have won their second Oscar nomination for best foreign language feature in five years with ""Kolya"".
The story of an ageing bachelor's re-awakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 ""Velvet Revolution"" -- it is favoured to win an Academy Award this month, after picking up Hollywood's Golden Globe in January.
Critics say the politically-charged comedy/drama, which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech new wave of the 1960s.
FIRST OSCAR NOMINATION IN 1992
The Sverak team made their first splash in 1992, when the post-war boys'-life drama-comedy ""Elementary School"" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost.
""When we had our first Oscar nomination we thought it would be the first and last time in our lives,"" says Jan.
Jan says he met an American scriptwriter in Hollywood four years ago who had been nominated 15 times but had never won an Oscar.
""He is my example,"" Zdenek jumps in to say.
While ""Kolya"" is set at the end of the communist era, it is again a mix of personal and political turmoil, seen often through a boy's eyes.
The two Sveraks have a close father-son relationship, frequently boyishly embracing in a country where ""macho"" usually means never hugging or shedding a tear.
""We are more friends than a father and son. We are very close characters. He has the same sense of humour as me, and we cry in the same part of the films,"" Zdenek says,
His son butts in to warn, ""They think we cry every time we watch the film.""
Awkward moments can sometimes occur when the son directs the father in love scenes.
In one shot, Zdenek revels in a post-amorous glow with the actress Libuse Safrankova, a woman Jan remembers most for her popular roles as a princess in many Czech fairytales.
""The script says they just finished making love and I have to explain to them that they have to breathe a bit, that they just can't lay there like they are resting... and they have to touch each other... this is bizarre,"" Jan says.
""Yes, bizarre,"" echoes his father.
After landing a deal with Miramax to distribute ""Kolya"" the Sveraks are working on an original English-language feature. The project is still a secret, while Zdenek finishes the script.
After a film, television, and stage career which has made him one of the most popular personalities in the country since the early 1970s, Zdenek says he has no regrets that he did not defect to pursue his career like so many Czechs including Oscar-winning director Milos Forman.
Jan, who came of age as a director after the revolution, says he will stay in Prague, despite offers to go abroad.
""This is the big advantage that we did not receive the Oscar for 'Elementary School' because I was so young and so hungry for American films... Now, I am not hungry any more, so we will make the European films,"" he says.
""There is no political reason to leave the country now and there are possibilities to make films in Europe, so why leave the country?""
But can the Sveraks' magic translate into English-language success? ""Kolya"" has been selling out art houses in New York and on the west coast, but does everyone get it?
""I think that you can get 100 percent of the meaning of 'Kolya', not 100 percent of the jokes,"" Jan says.
""I think the audience can catch the whole message, and not all the jokes unfortunately... But the political background and our geographic situation, that's part of this message...,"" Zdenek replies.

25,"Czech President Vaclav Havel said on Thursday he was deeply disturbed by a Chinese court's 11-year prison sentence on dissident Wang Dan on charges of plotting to overthrow the government.
Havel, himself a former dissident against a Communist government, said in a statement that after last year's jailing of Wei Jingsheng, father of China's small democracy movement, on similar subversion charges, Wang's sentence was ""unacceptable"".
Wang, 27, was jailed for 11 years on Wednesday after a brief hearing.
Wei Jingsheng, freed in 1993 after serving all but six months of an earlier 15-year term for subversion, was rearrested the following year and formally sentenced in December 1996 to another 14-year term. He is now 47.
Havel's statement, issued by his spokesman, said that Wang's sentence ""was another example of the unacceptable understanding of the position of the citizen in society.""
The statement added that Havel expressed his ""deep dissatisfaction"" over the decision.
It said Havel ""considers it his obligation to express his solidarity with those who anywhere around the world express, in a non-violent way, their free-mindedness and desire for justice and elementary human rights.""
Havel, who as a dissident playwright was imprisoned several times by the Communist government before its fall in 1989, has been a frequent diplomatic thorn in China's side.
He angered China last year with a highly publicised meeting with Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan, forcing a hurried restatement of the Czechs' official ""One-China Policy"".
Earlier this year the Czech president said that he regretted that Chinese Nationalist-ruled Taiwan, which Bejing regards as a renegade province, is not a U.N. member. However, the Czechs officially still recognise only China as a sovereign state.
Earlier on Thursday, the Czech Foreign Ministry called in China's chief diplomat in Prague, charge d'affaires Wang Zizhen, to read him a statement of protest.
""The Czech Republic expresses its dissatisfaction over the conduct of the trial and the judgment carried out,"" said a text of the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.
It said that, although there were differences in traditions of understanding questions of human rights in different regions, ""there exist certain universal principles of maintaining human rights which are necessary to respect"".
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said in Beijing on Thursday that the jailing was not a human rights issue but an ordinary legal matter.
The Czech ministry statement said, however, that criminalisation of freedom of speech was ""a violation of elementary human rights"".

25,"Czech railway workers on Wednesday voted to extend a national railway strike, scheduled to end at midnight, for another 24 hours after the government supported a tough approach against the strikers.
Jaromir Dusek, chairman of the Association of Unions of Czech Railway Workers (OSZ), was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying that OSZ's strike committee had agreed to continue the action for at least another day.
Dusek was quoted by the private television channel Prima after the decision to extend the strike that the OSZ would keep extending the strike until it gets an acceptable compromise.
The OSZ had originally scheduled the action as a 48-hour strike, but said it would consider extending it for 24 hours at a time if its demands were not met.
The government on Wednesday backed Transport Minister Martin Riman's hard line against the OSZ, which has shut the country's entire rail network over potential job cuts.
Government spokesman Ivo Strejcek told reporters after a cabinet meeting that ""the government expressed its support"" for Riman, who has refused union demands for a long-term railway plan that guarantees jobs while sacking the current management.
The spokesman declined any further comment.
CTK quoted Riman later on Wednesday as saying a Prague court had ruled that the strike was illegal, but the OSZ then said that a different court had ruled that the strike was lawful.
The strike, the first major nationwide post-Communist industrial action, has had little major impact on daily life, but businesses fear the shutdown in freight service will start to bite into earnings if the strike lasts longer.
Cities have added buses to relieve commmuter pressure, but international trains have been stranded at borders with Germany, Poland, Austria, and Slovakia.
Two rounds of talks between Riman and union officials on Tuesday failed to break the impasse, and the minister acknowledged the strike may go on longer. Fresh talks on Wednesday have apparently not yet led to a solution.
The OSZ wants the government to implement a long-term plan to revive the decrepit railway system, saying that waste and inefficiency should be cleaned up before jobs are threatened.
The state railway company, Ceske Drahy, lost six billion crowns ($216.4 million) in 1996, and expects to lose seven billion crowns this year, but the government has been unable to put together a viable plan for reversing the losses.
Leaders of the OSZ reported that 75 to 80 percent of the more than 100,000 railway workers had joined the strike, but management of the railway company said over 60 percent showed up for work and signed a petition against the strike.
An attempt to use workers who ignored the strike resulted in the operation of a just five trains on Wednesday, but the system was mostly idle.
An effort to reconstruct Ceske Drahy ended in 1994 when the conservative government backed off privatisation plans to halt a threatened strike just hours before it was to begin.
This time, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has given ominous warnings that the unions ""may go too far"" with the strike.
Most major Czech firms have said a short-term strike will have little effect on their operations, though the coal mining company Mostecka Uhelna Spolecnost a.s. said it was losing between 15-20 million crowns a day due to the action.

25,"Elections to the new Czech Senate over the next two weekends will only thicken the country's political fog, but an indecisive electorate has already been priced into the financial markets, analysts said on Monday.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has been stuck in an uneasy political co-habitation since his centre-right coalition fell two seats short of a majority in the lower house on a strong second place showing by the Social Democrats in June.
Analysts say the Senate elections should not signal any clear shift in the political winds, and the markets will be stuck wondering if the three-party conservative government can hang on for its four-year term which runs through the year 2000.
They say only an unexpected clear victory for the opposition Social Democrats over Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would hurt the Czech crown or capital markets.
""The markets will definitely turn down (on a Social Democrat victory), same as in the (lower house) elections,"" said Vladimir Jaros, research director at Prague investment house Wood &amp; Co.
But he added that market expectations ""are for ODS to win"".
Klaus and his team of economists and technocrats became standard-bearers for post-Communist reforms after taking power in 1992 with a 12-seat majority in the lower house.
The markets, pollsters and pundits were caught off guard when the Social Democrats -- who have been ambivalent to balanced budgets and privatisations -- did so well.
The crown fell a full percentage point on the June results, and the stock market lost more than four percent of its value before stabilising when a minority government was confirmed.
""I think investors (this time) have already included in their behaviour expectations of inconclusive results,"" said Zdenek Bakala, chairman of Prague-based Patria Finance.
ODS and the Social Democrats are running close in recent opinion polls at around 25 percent support each, after ODS won the June vote with 29.6 percent, with CSSD at 26.4 percent.
But since the Senate vote is a first-past-the-post poll in individual constituencies, forecasting victory is difficult when gauged only by available party preference surveys.
Local analysts see Klaus's ODS and its two coalition allies winning a majority of the Senate's 81 seats, but they do not expect a result giving the coalition or opposition a clear advantage to push for an early election in the lower house.
""I don't think we are going to be facing a risk of extraordinary (lower house) elections, and I doubt that ODS will be willing to take that risk,"" Jaros said.
The two-round Senate polls, beginning on Friday with runoffs the next weekend, are not likely alter the course of the country's legislative agenda.
The stock market and the Czech crown have had diverging fates since the June vote, for reasons beyond election fears.
The crown has remained strong, despite a growing trade gap, consistently trading in a tight range between 2.5 to 3.0 percent above the central bank's mark/dollar basket.
The crown got a boost in October when four Social Democrats crossed over to vote with the government in approving the first draft of the 1997 budget.
Meanwhile, the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) has been rocked, not by the political situation, but by discontent from foreign investors unhappy with the country's opaque trading environment.
The PSE's official PX50 index has been on a steady slide since late summer, dipping below 500 last week, heading toward its historic record low of 387.
Few think the Senate elections will serve to revive the securities markets, as market reform is not a high priority.

9,"The semiconductor industry's key indicator of computer chip demand rose in September to its highest level this year, reflecting a stronger-than-expected increase in new orders.
The Semiconductor Industry Association said Tuesday the North American book-to-bill ratio, which measures the value of orders against shipments, rose to 0.99 in September from a revised 0.93 in August. The ratio means manufacturers received $99 in new orders last month for every $100 in shipments.
Industry analysts had expected the ratio to inch closer to breakeven with most estimates averaging around 0.95.
New orders for chips rose to $3.19 billion, a 9 percent increase from August, and shipments inched upward to $3.22 billion, or 2.1 percent above August's level.
""From any perspective, these are the most positive numbers we've seen all year,"" Douglas Andrey, director of information systems and finance for the association, said in a statement. ""The modest increase in orders for August and September suggest the 1996 slowdown in growth has bottomed out.
The ratio, a leading indicator of future demand tallied by the industry trade group, has been improving recently, reflecting an increase in orders by personal computer makers and more stable prices for memory chips.
""People are buying PCs as if there's no tomorrow,"" said Dan Klesken, an analyst at Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. ""We're having a PC-led recovery in the chip industry.""
Analysts predicted the better-than-expected ratio would likely send shares of key technology stocks higher on Wednesday.
In after-hours trading, shares of Intel Corp., the world's largest chipmaker, rose $1.375 to $103 and shares of Micron Technology Inc., a key supplier of memory chips, jumped 87.5 cents to $32.375.
Prices of memory chips, or DRAMs, plummeted over the course of the year to a fraction of what they were in January. Because memory chips make up about 40 percent of the unit volume of semiconductors shipped in a year, their prices have had a big influence on orders and sales measured in dollars.
But since mid-September, memory prices have risen 30 percent to 50 percent from their lows.
The September ratio marked the highest level since December of 1995 when the index hit 1.12. A year ago it stood at 1.16.
Micron said late last week that memory chip inventories were down to desirable levels from formerly excessive levels.
Worldwide, the ratio rose to 0.97 in August from 0.95 in July. Global figures include Asia, Europe, North America and Japan and are one month behind North American figures. The Japan book-to-bill ratio rose above 1.0.
Robertson Stephen's Klesken said he was particulary impressed by the rise in Europe, which had a ration of 1.04.

9,"Sony Corp. on Monday cut the U.S. price of its PlayStation video game machine by 25 percent to $149, a move that is expected to boost the entire video game industry.
Sony also cut the price of all of its new software titles for the PlayStation to $49, making games for the machine cheaper than many of its rivals' offerings.
The price cuts make the PlayStation $50 cheaper than the Nintendo 64, Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s rival video game machine. Sony's move could force Nintendo to cut its prices, which would accelerate hardware and accelerate software purchases, analysts said.
""Hardware price cuts are good news for everybody,"" said Mike Wallace, analyst at UBS Securities in New York. ""The most important thing to the industry is a bigger installed base"" of video game machines.
Sony's price cut could be the start of a boom for the video game industry, similar to the one in the late 1980s.
For the past three years, game companies have had lukewarm sales because of high prices for the new generation of video game machines, based on so-called 32-bit or 64-bit technologies. While the next-generation offerings from Sony, Nintendo and Sega Enterprises have much better graphics and sound than their predecessors, they have been too expensive for most households, analysts said.
With the price cut, the number of PlayStation units in use in the United States could almost double to 6 million by Christmas, from about 3.4 million right now, Wallace said.
Sony officials said even with the price cuts they make money on each PlayStation. They also said they do not expect their software price cuts to hurt outside software publishers, since Sony's software prices are slightly higher than the rest of the industry's.
Software executives applauded Sony's move.
""This is obviously great for the software publishers,"" said Bobby Kotick, chairman of video game software company Activision Inc.. Kotick said with hardware prices getting closer to $100, he expects 18 million to 20 million machines to be sold by year-end.
Nintendo officials said they are analyzing Sony's move. Nintendo is sold out of the Nintendo 64 machine and has a month's backlog of orders at $199 apiece, so it does not have a reason to cut its prices for now, said George Harrison, Nintendo vice president of marketing in Redmond, Wash.
Sega officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

9,"Apple Computer Inc. stunned investors Wednesday by reporting an unexpected $25 million profit for the last three months of its fiscal year.
The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker, which had been expected to lose around 30 cents a share in the quarter, posted a profit of 20 cents a share, the first time Apple was in the black this year.
Included in the operating results for the fourth quarter of Apple's fiscal 1996 was a gain of $17 million, or 14 cents a share.
Wall Street welcomed the news, bidding the company's stock price up $2.25 to $28 a share in after-hours trading.
Analysts cited improved manufacturing efficiencies, lower component costs and reduced operating expenses for the better-than-expected performance.
""It is a shock,"" said Daniel Kunstler, computer industry analyst at JP Morgan. ""It seems they've brought the break-even point for their business down pretty dramatically. This is very encouraging.""
In the year-ago quarter, Apple earned $60 million, or 48 cents a share. Revenues for the three months ended in September fell to $2.32 billion from $3.0 billion a year ago.
For the full year, Apple posted a loss of $816 million, or $6.59 a share, reflecting a series of hefty one-time charges for inventory writedowns and restructurings.
In fiscal 1995, Apple earned $424 million, or $3.45 a share.
During the year, Apple was hurt by a sharp decline in its market share, management turmoil and an inability to have the right products on the shelf at the right time.
However, in the last two quarters Apple has started to show signs of a turnaround under former National Semiconductor Corp. chief Gilbert Amelio.
In a statement, Amelio said Apple's financial situation is stablized, as evidenced by the improvement in gross margins during the quarter and cash flow.
""By increasing revenues sequentially and fortifying Apple's financial position in each of the last two quarters, we have achieved two very critical goals of Apple's transformation,"" Amelio said. ""We remain confident about reaching sustainable profitability by the end of Q2 '97.
""As we move forward, our challenges will be to extend our competitive leadership in key markets and to reclaim the mantle of industry pioneer and innovator,"" he said.
Apple's gross margins -- the difference between what it sells its products for and the cost of goods -- rose to 22 percent in the fourth quarter from 18.5 percent in the third quarter.
More importantly, however, Apple ended the quarter with more than $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand, up from $952 million a year ago.
""We continue to make progress in strengthening Apple's financial condition, as our $410 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter suggests,"" said Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred  Anderson. ""We've reduced inventories by nearly $400 million since June and completed the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments.""
""Gross margins increased due to several factors, including declining component costs, improved manufacturing efficiencies, and sales of previously reserved inventory,"" he added. ""We achieved further sequential reductions in operating expenses, primarily in general and administrative functions.""
While shipments were down 26 percent in the fourth quarter to 932,000 units from the year-ago quarter, Apple said shipments were up 11 percent, a sign that customers were once again buying its products.

9,"Apple Computer Inc will announce as early as Monday a new round of massive job cuts and a plan to reduce the company's operations to three groups, a person close to the company said on Sunday.
The second restructuring in the 12 months since new Chief Executive Gilbert Amelio took control of the struggling company may include job cuts of up to a quarter of Apple's 13,000 workforce, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday.
The restructuring also may include moves to focus Apple's half-a-dozen business units even more on selling computers to the publishing industry and schools, the segments where Apple still holds a market-share lead over competitors, the person close to Apple said.
The fourth-biggest U.S. maker of personal computers has been taking a closer look at unprofitable product lines, such as the Newton handheld computer, with an eye toward discontinuing them.
The latest restructuring would come less than a month after Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported an unexpected fiscal first-quarter loss of $120 million. The loss was a setback to Amelio's three-year plan to staunch Apple's losses by 1996, introduce new products by 1997 and to get the company growing again by 1998.
To meet its goal, Apple has to cut another $400 million in costs this year to break even, Apple executives have said. Last year, Apple laid off 1,500 employees. But as customers avoid buying computers from the troubled company, revenue has declined faster than Apple executives expected.
According to a report released last week by market researcher Dataquest, Apple's U.S. shipments dropped 30 pecent in 1996 while the rest of the industry grew 17.8 percent.
Apple now expects revenue for the current fiscal year, which will end September, to decline by about 20 percent to $8 billion.
Apple is still working on the details of the restructuring plan, Apple sources said. An announcement on Monday would come two days before Apple's annual shareholder meeting at its headquarters.

In the past three quarters, Apple has reported huge losses as customers have defected to cheap IBM-compatible personal computers running Microsoft Corp's easy-to-use Windows 95 software.  By cutting costs and firing workers, Apple has managed to whittle its losses.  
Wall Street expects Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., to post a loss of $0.30 a share, according to a recent survey of 23 analysts by First Call.  In the fiscal fourth quarter last year, Apple reported net income of $60.1 million, or $0.48 a share, on revenue of $3.0 billion.
Apple's new management, under former National Semiconductor Corp chief Gilbert Amelio, has done a good job cutting expenses, analysts said.
Apple also has managed to raise enough cash to be out of a dire cash shortage, which threatened to hamper day-to-day operations. The company could even generate a little cash from its business this quarter, analysts said.
The trick now is to convince consumers that the Macintosh is a worthy competitor to PC clones.

9,"Apple Computer Chairman Gilbert Amelio told the annual shareholders' meeting Wednesday that he was suspending Apple's executive cash bonus plan until the struggling computer maker returned to profitability.
""Let me assure you that my highest priority is to get this company in the black as early as possible,"" Amelio told Apple shareholders.
Amelio said that when he took the helm of Apple Computer Inc. one year ago, it faced five crises, which he has sought to address.
""We were broke,"" he said, adding that financial liquidity was so tight the company barely had enough reserves to manage its daily business.
Amelio's comments came a day after the company announced another restructuring and less than a month after Apple stunned Wall Street with a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997.
Amelio did not provide specifics about the restructuring or how many jobs might be cut as Apple seeks to cut costs.
But he said the company planned to suspend the executive bonus plan until Apple returned to profitability. Recently, Apple officials said they expect to begin making profits again by the end of the 1997 fiscal year in September.
The decision to suspend the cash payouts came after Apple revealed some executives received substantial bonuses last year when Apple reported an unexpected fourth-quarter profit.
The payout was the result of a change in the compensation plan which allowed the executives to receive bonuses based on the company's fourth-quarter rather than full-year results.
For the fourth quarter, which ended in September, Apple reported a profit of $25 million, surprising Wall Street, which had been expecting the company to report a modest loss.
Much of that profit, however, came from a one-time gain Apple recognised for an inventory adjustment. Without that, Apple would have reported a modest loss or broken even, one analyst estimated.
Based on that one profitable quarter, Apple's senior executives received ""175 percent of their special bonus target,"" according to Apple's proxy statement. Amelio, who had a separate compensation agreement with the company, received a $648,000 bonus on top of his $990,000 base salary. Apple did not disclose the bonuses of the other executives.
Apple officials said the special bonus plan was meant to encourage executives to meet their turnaround goals.
""It was basically to motivate them to achieve profitability,"" Apple spokeswoman Nancy Paxton said on Tuesday. She said the executives had expected financial performance to improve after the fourth quarter.
Apple stock fell 12.5 cents to $15.25 on Nasdaq.
"
9,"Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday said it plans to release an operating system that looks like the Macintosh and runs Mac software, but will run on personal computers based on chips from Intel Corp.
At its annual developer conference, the company also said it will release programming tools in the next few months that allow companies to write software for the Macintosh once, and automatically convert their products to run on PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Corp. Windows software.
The radical strategy is part of Apple's plan to keep software companies from abandoning making Macintosh products, Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio told a crowd of 1,900 programmers in San Jose, Calif.
""For those of you who seek substantial business on both the Mac and Windows platforms, this new development environment holds tremendous promise,"" Amelio said. ""You can (write your applications once) and with a simple recompilation release them for both platforms.""
Until now, the Macintosh operating system -- the programme that controls the basic functions of Apple computers -- has run only on machines designed by Apple.
Amelio said Apple's next-generation operating system, code-named Rhapsody, will not only run on Apple-designed computers, but on PCs based on Intel chips and using Microsoft software.
For the past two years, Apple has been scrambling to come up with improvements to the Macintosh that would set it apart from the PCs. Until 1995, Apple had relied on its computers' famed ease-of-use as a selling point, but Microsoft's release of Windows 95 took away much of the impact of Apple's pitch.
Last year, Apple gave up a mired effort to revamp the Mac OS, the fundamental programme that gives the Mac its look. In December, the company bought Next Software Inc. to get its software overhaul going again, and to use its software as the foundation of a next-generation operating system.
The move concerned lots of programmers, though, because of fears that the new operating system, Rhapsody, would not run the products they designed for the older Mac operating system. Programmers also were not thrilled to have to develop products for yet another operating system.
Apple plans to spend the rest of this week convincing programmers that it is a worthwhile investment to write software for Rhapsody. Apple's stock edged down 19 cents to $17.375 on Nasdaq in late trading.
"
9,"Be Inc., a private software company which Apple Computer Inc. is eyeing as a possible acquisition target, will announce Tuesday that it will license software to an Apple rival, Be executives said.
Be will license its BeOS operating system -- a type of programme that controls the basic functions of a computer -- to Power Computing Corp., a maker of computers compatible with Apple's Macintosh, executives of the companies said. Power Computing will have an exclusive license until April 1997.
Apple itself has been considering using Be's software. Earlier this year, the No. 3 PC maker shelved a mired effort to rewrite the Macintosh operating system and has been looking outside, primarily at Be, for programming talent.
Be and Power Computing executives said their agreement was not a threat to Apple's plans. Instead, the companies are offering fast machines that would appeal to saavy users, such as programmers, game developers and Web site managers, known as Webmasters.
""This agreement has no impact on any deal we may or may not conclude with Apple,"" said Mark Gonzalez, marketing director at Be, based in Menlo Park, Calif.
An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the agreement.
Be, founded in 1992 by the former head of Apple's research and development, writes software that takes full advantage of the multimedia and computing capabilities of the PowerPC microprocessor, the same computer chip that serves as the brains of the Macintosh.
The company's BeOS includes many software features and innovations that Apple's programmers have not been able to include in Macintosh software.
Apple, struggling to set the Macintosh apart from personal computers running software from Microsoft Corp., has been negotiating with Be since June about licensing its products or buying Be outright, executives close to the negotiations have said.
Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio and Chief Technology Officer Ellen Hancock have hinted in recent weeks that Apple planned to rewrite the core of the Macintosh software itself, but will turn to outside software companies for help in developing the features a computer user would see on the screen, including next-generation multimedia capabilities.
"
9,"Apple Computer Inc. Friday said it plans to cut 4,100 jobs in a restructuring aimed at returning the company to profitability.
The troubled computer maker said the restructuring, its second major overhaul in the last 12 months, will result in a $155 million charge in its second quarter ending in March.
The reserve would be in addition to a planned $325 million charge the current quarter for the previously announced purchase of Next Software Inc.
The cuts -- including 2,700 full-time employees and 1,400 contract workers -- were slightly less than what some analysts had expected. Apple said it planned to begin notifying employees about the layoffs later this month.
Apple, once the darling of the computer industry, has suffered in recent years from missed opportunities, management turmoil and failed strategies that resulted in the firings of former Chief Executives John Sculley in 1993 and Michael Spindler in 1996.
Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who took over about a year ago, said the latest restructuring was aimed at boosting Apple's core business.
""The top priorities guiding our reorganization are the rapid delivery of distinctive products for our loyal business, education, and home customers, and the development of a robust next-generation operating system to carry them into the future,"" Amelio said in a statement.
""We can best achieve these goals by streamlining our organization, simplifying our product lines to deliver fewer but much stronger models, and stopping investments in activities that are not central to these core businesses,"" he said.
Over the last five quarters, Apple has posted more than $900 million in losses, reflecting slower sales of its flagship line of Macintosh personal computers and restructuring expenses.
In a statement issued after the market closed, Apple said it will phase out its slow-selling Performa Macintosh home computers this spring in favor of Power Mac models.
Disappointing Christmas sales of the Performa line led to a stunning $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and a steep decline in Apple's market share.
According to research firm Dataquest, Apple's share of the worldwide PC market tumbled to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent in 1995.
As part of the restructuring, Apple said it was exploring options for its Netwon hand-held personal assistant and will no longer produce Apple-branded Pippin devices, which enable television sets to access the Internet.
While Apple will continue to enhance its Mac Operating System, the company said some parts of the system -- such as the Open Doc component software technology, Cyberdog, Open Transport, Game Sprockets, and Mac OS Development Tools -- will receive less money for upgrades.
Apple will also halt funding for the Video Conferencing Solution and AIX Server Software.
The moves are aimed at cutting Apple's expenses by at least $400 million a year so the company can be profitable with revenues of around $8 billion.
Apple said it was revising the delivery schedule for future Mac Operating System releases but still plans to deliver its latest version, code-named Rhapsody, in 1998.

20,"Cathay Pacific Airways has raised air cargo rates from Hong Kong to compensate for higher fuel costs, cargo marketing and sales manager Ray Jewell told Reuters.
He declined to say by how much rates have been increased but said they have been introduced on a route by route basis ""wherever possible"" and not system-wide.
""There's been a huge cost associated with the increase in fuel and we have already had to make adjustments in our rates to compensate,"" Jewell said.
Other major airlines told Reuters they are raising their ex-Hong Kong cargo rates in response to higher fuel costs after an attempt to impose an 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo fuel surcharge was turned down by the territory's Civil Aviation Department.
The 80 HK cents surcharge is the equivalent to the 10 U.S cents/kg fuel surcharge being levies by many airlines around the world. Cathay is currently applying this surcharge or the local currency equivalent to flights from Europe.
Cathay Cargo also reported very good peak season business both in and out of Hong Kong on long-haul routes which shows no sign of any slackening off.
""Flights are full now and it is a very good peak season,"" Jewell said.
Earlier Cathay had said it would soon apply to the CAD for a three percent increase in passenger fares because of higher fuel costs. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

20,"Asiana Airlines is to take delivery of a third new Boeing 747-400 freighter next month to replace a wet leased DC-10 cargo aircraft on the Seoul to New York route, the airline's cargo marketing and sales director, T.S. Kang said.
The South Korean carrier uses two DC-10 freighters wet leased from U.S. operators Gemini Air Cargo and World Airways for its six flights per week to New York.
The World Airways freighter is to be returned and Gemini's retained until the end of next year to continue to fly three times a week to New York with the new Boeing flying the other three, Kang told Reuters in a telephone interview from Seoul.
The 747-400 will offer Asiana extra cargo carrying capacity as it carries more than 100 tonnes compared to around 65 tonnes for the DC-10.
""The new 747 which is about to be delivered will replace one of the DC-10s which is being returned. One 747 equals two DC-10 flights and is a welcome addition to our fleet,"" Kang said
Asiana has two 747-400 and one 767 freighter and has  plans to expand its cargo aircraft fleet to 10 by 2005.
Kang said Gemini has now received permission from Korea's Ministry of Transportation and Construction to fly into Korea under its own name. Gemini specialises in offering its converted aircraft to established airlines on wet lease contracts known as ACMI - aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance.

20,"Air Hong Kong Ltd (AHK) chief operating officer, Stanley Hui said the August 25 start of its first trans-Pacific service means the airline is now firmly headed in the right direction.
The head of Hong Kong's only all-cargo airline told Reuters in an interview said it was ""an important milestone towards a much brighter future.""
However Hui said the cargo carrier did not make any money in the first half of 1996 suffering, like many others, from low yields.
Last year AHK made its first ever profit and although Hui would not disclose the exact amount, he said it was ""very healthy"" after ""huge losses"" in the past.
Four years ago, things were so bad that the airline was just a telephone call away from going under, industry sources said.
But then a new management team was installed, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd came to the rescue by taking a 75 percent stake, loss-making routes were cut, old aircraft were retired and three newly converted Boeing 747-200s acquired, Hui added.
The new aircraft are able to carry 25 tons more tonnes than the carrier's old aircraft and complete with a new Chinese wheel company logo signifying brisk business, they began a twice weekly service to Chicago on August 25.
When Air Hong Kong's third converted 747 leased from Cathay Pacific for 15 years joins the fleet in October, the Chicago service will become three times weekly.
Hui says the new route has been possible with the leasing of the three former combi 747s which formerly flew with the Brazilian airline Varig.
The aircraft, converted at Boeing facilities in Wichita, Kansas and at Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Ltd, will give AHK a much higher aircraft utilisation rate from 12 to 14 hours per day.
AHK existing fleet of older 747s are being returned to the leasing company.
""We're talking about more expensive aeroplanes but they're more reliable, with better payload and can help save on maintenance so it's a good investment for this company.""Hui said.
Cathay Pacific has handed its once weekly Chicago service over to AHK in order to concentrate on its own new twice weekly freighter service to New York which also started on August 24.
The new U.S. services have been made possible after a new air agreement was drawn up between the U.S. and Hong Kong government.
AHK also fly to Dubai, Brussels and Manchester five times a week and twice weekly to Osaka. It has applied for a twice weekly service to Seoul in South Korea on Friday.
Hui said there has been a 20 per cent drop in cargo selling rates over the past six months.
""But I'm not surprised, the market is very competive, very seasonal and slow in the first half. We have seen a slower market this year consequently rates have dropped, tonnage is down, rates and yields are down but I think we are seeing a nice recovery. Developing for us and Chicago will help that. It is a very important gateway for us,"" Hui said.

20,"DHL Worldwide Express plans to strengthen its role as market leader in China by opening 14 new offices and employing another 600 staff within the next three years, said the company's area manager for Hong Kong and China, Andy Tseng.
DHL celebrates its tenth anniversary of China operations next month ""far ahead of our competitors and with 30 per cent market share"", Tseng told Reuters in his Hong Kong office near Kai Tak airport.
Tseng said China may win 10 per cent of all DHL sales within Asia by the year 2000. DHL expects to expand its Chinese network to 26 by the end of this year and 40 within the next three years from the current 19. The new offices, to include Harbin, Pudong and Kunming, are in 50-50 joint ventures witrh Chinese partners, DHL said.
DHL's China venture began in 1986 when it set up a joint venture with China's largest forwarding company Sinotrans. DHL says it received another boost three years ago when it became the first joint venture to offer express links between domestic Chinese companies.
""Choosing the right partner was vital as is demonstrating a long term committment to China. We have demonstrated that,"" Tseng said.
Like all fast freight companies trying to do business in China, Tseng says the lack of infrastructure is a handicap but DHL is leading the way by expanding its network.
""The distribution network and lack of freight links has been identified as the key problem. But service quality and flexibility is particularly important in China,"" he added.
The 20 year veteran with DHL said that unlike rivals such as Federal Express, it enjoys a competitive advantage in China by not having its own fleet of aircraft running in competition with Chinese airlines. Tseng says he wants to strengthen the company's ""very good"" existing relationships with third party local airlines such as China Northern and China Eastern.
Tseng also said the average express shipment is getting heavier and pointed to the marketing success of DHL's Jumbo Box as offering a simple one price product which customers find easy to understand. But he said DHL has not yet started offering the Jumbo Box to customers in China. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017

Tseng told Reuters in an interview, that he expects the new service will be slowly built up after initial flights on December 20 and 29.
""The first two flights were a combination of local cargo supported by cargo from Hong Kong and topped up in Bangkok so it was shared by three hubs which we are using to slowly build up the Guangzhou service.""
""You have to remember Guangzhou is nothing compared to Hong Kong which is the traditional entry point. Because we have such strong competition from Hong Kong it takes a little time to convince shippers. In China the main problem is the red tape and documentation but they picking it up very fast,"" Tseng added.
The Dutch cargo carrier became the first European airline to be allowed to fly scheduled services into the southern Chinese city after twice being postponed in October and November because of ""licensing and equipment"" delays.
After a New Year holiday suspension, Martinair said it will begin a regular scheduled service proper on January 23 and every Friday after that. Also as a result of lengthy Government negotiations, Guangzhou based China Southern Airlines won permission to begin its first European service to Amsterdam.
Martinair, which earlier described the new Boeing 747-200 link via Bangkok and Abu Dhabi as a ""historic"" new link said it aims to capture a profitable portion of the air cargo market to Europe from the booming Pearl River delta region of southern China. Up to now most European bound air cargo from southern China is trucked over the border and flown from Hong Kong. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

20,"An American airline has successfully completed a proving flight over Russian air space which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said is an important milestone in the introduction of the Future Air Navigation System (FANS) on trans-Pacific routes.
The United Airlines Boeing 747-400 flight from Chicago to Tokyo's Narita airport on November 15 is expected to be followed by more pioneering trials over the next three weeks by Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, said David Behrens, international programme officer of the FAA.
FANS, or Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM), is the next generation air traffic management system which uses satellite navigation for the more efficient use of air space.
""Aircraft which are FANS equipped will have the competitive edge with reduced costs all round. The technology will mean more direct routes, less fuel burned, more cargo carried, reduced air traffic controls costs, reduced errors and ground delays -- there is no turning back"", David Behrens told this week's Asian Air Cargo Summit.
The U.S. was working towards a new bilateral agreement with Russia to develop air traffic control infrastructure in the Far East to open up air space to airlines flying between Asia and American cities such as New York, Chicago and Detroit.
""There have been a lot of problems in getting demonstration flights approved by the Russian authorities. The use of English which is the international language of the skies is still a major problem. This is another milestone in the development of FANS and the most successful proving flight to date although it is still early days,"" Behrens said.
Speaking after the conference Behrens said further advances are hoped for at the Informal Pacific Air Traffic Control Co-ordination Group meeting in Tokyo on January 20.
Airlines which have already invested in FANS cockpit technology are waiting on the go ahead for a new ""fast track"" routing across the central Pacific Ocean cutting up to an hour off journey times between Hong Kong or Taipei to San Francisco or Los Angeles. China Airlines, United Airlines and Cathay Pacific which is awaiting Hong Kong government approval to use FANS cockpit technology, could be the first airlines to benefit, Behrens said.
Korean Airlines, which has to make a big U-turn to avoid military training areas near North Korea air space, is also expected to make ""huge savings"" from FANS technology with a 40 minute saving on U.S. bound flights from Seoul when a new agreement with the North is signed, the FAA estimate.
Only about 70 Boeing 747-400 aircraft, the inter-continental workhorse of many airlines, are currently equipped with FANS avionics but that total is about to mushroom and all airliners will be FANS equipped by the year 2002, Behrens predicted. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

20,"Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it has retired the last of its Lockheed TriStars.
Cathay's 19 TriStar airliners in the carrier's old green and white livery have been a familiar sight in the Hong Kong skies since 1975 flying more than 487,000 hours and millions of passengers. At its peak the fleet was logging 609,000 kilometres every week - equal to the moon and halfway back.
""It is more than a piece of metal. The TriStar has got character and it's a bit of a thoroughbred,"" said veteran Cathay pilot Captain John Bent.
The three engined L1011 airliners have been gradually phased out over the past two years and replaced in a US$9 billion fleet replacement programme on Cathay's regional and medium-haul routes by new, twin engined Airbus Industrie A330-300 and Boeing 777-200 airliners offering greater fuel efficiency, passenger comfort and cargo handling capability. The A330 can carry up to 32 LD-2 cargo containers in its belly weighing up to 22 tons, the TriStar can only carry around eight tons of cargo, Cathay said.

20,"Cargo airlines may fly elsewhere if the cost of using Hong Kong's new airport is dramatically increased, the Orient Airlines Association (OAA) director-general Richard Stirland said.
Stirland, speaking from Manila, told Reuters he is alarmed at reports that charges may double when Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok replaces Kai Tak in 1998.
The OAA  represents 16 of the major carriers in Asia including Singapore Airlines Ltd, Japan Airlines Co Ltd, Thai Airways International Ltd and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd,
Stirland said some airlines - especially cargo carriers - may bypass Hong Kong for cheaper alternatives nearby such as Macau, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
""You may get a situation as in Europe where freighter operators don't need to go to Heathrow or Paris-Charles de Gaulle and use smaller, cheaper alternatives instead,"" he added.
It currently costs around US$24,000 for a two hour stop in Hong Kong compared to $23,000 at Singapore's Changi, he said.
The new Hong Kong Airport Authority has said charges will ""inevitably rise"" but added that reports that they will double are ""pure speculation.""
A spokeswoman said it will not be until early next year how that a decision will be taken on how much it will cost after the airlines have been consulted.
The charges will then have to be approved by Hong Kong's Director of Civil Aviation.
A spokesman for one of the major users of the new airport, Hong Kong's de facto flag carrier Cathay Pacific said it is concerned at price rises which would have to be passed on to airline passengers and cargo customers.
""There is a big concern about fees rising which would damage all airlines and Hong Kong as a regional hub. Ultimately we could not absorb that sort of increase which would be passed onto our customers,"" Kwan Chuk-fai said.

3,"Chrysler Corp., planning for a future without fear of financial crisis, said Tuesday it can boost its annual production capacity past 4 million vehicles and grab 20 percent of the U.S. car and truck market.
Chrysler's top executives, in a series of briefings Tuesday, said the automaker was poised to boost its financial performance further through cost cuts, engineering innovations, new products and other initiatives.
Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said the automaker has not made market share a goal, but said an 18 percent to 20 percent share of the U.S. car and truck market ""is not unrealistic"" for Chrysler.
Detroit's third-largest automaker held 16.2 percent of the market during the first nine months of 1996 -- roughly its highest share ever.
After working to rebuild Chrysler's product line, operations and balance sheet after financial crises in 1980 and 1991, the automaker's management team is now focusing on long-term growth.
""For the first time in its history, this company doesn't have to spend every waking moment looking over its shoulder and worrying about its future,"" said Chrysler President Bob Lutz. ""We've moved beyond saying 'never again' to 'Why not?'""
Indeed, Eaton said he now believes that Chrysler can withstand a 10 percent to 20 percent drop in production and remain profitable -- something that was impossible five years ago.
With a string of hit products, especially Jeeps and minivans, under its belt, the automaker is planning to boost capacity to 3.765 million vehicles by the year 2000 from 3.2 million this year.
Included in those figures are a new Dodge sport utility vehicle that will go on sale in the fall of 1997. Industry analysts have said the vehicle will be called the Dodge Durango and will be based on the new Dakota compact pickup truck.
The automaker could build up to 4.2 million vehicles annually in its current assembly plants if it adds third production shifts, said manufacturing Executive Vice President Dennis Pawley.
That does not include the possible replacement of Chrysler's Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant.
Eaton confirmed that the automaker was working with state and local officials to study replacement options for the 86-year-old facility, but has made no firm plans.
Much of Chrysler's increased capacity will be aimed at overseas markets. The executive vice president of international operations, Thomas Gale, said Chrysler expected to double its international vehicle sales to 500,000 vehicles over the next three years from 250,000 this year.
Gale said he believed Chrysler can ultimately sell more than 1 million vehicles overseas but did not offer a timetable.
He showed off a prototype of a proposed ultra-low-cost car for emerging markets such as China, which features an all-plastic body and a two-cylinder, 0.8-litre engine made by Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp.
The bare-bones car, which would not meet U.S. emissions and safety regulations, resembles France's discontinued but much-loved Citroen 2CV and could sell for $5,000 to $6,000.
Eaton, who Monday announced surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings of $680 million, up from $365 million a year ago, outlined several financial goals for the automaker, without giving a timetable. They include:
-- Boosting production by 6 percent a year.
-- Cutting research and development spending to 2.5 percent of revenues from 2.7 percent. Ford Motor Co.'s spending rate is 5.9 percent of revenues, General Motors Corp. is at 5.5 percent and Toyota Motor Corp. is at 5.0 percent, Chrysler said.
-- Cutting marketing costs to 6.3 percent of sales from 6.5 percent currently.
-- Boosting return on sales to 8.0 percent from 6.5 percent for the first nine months of 1996 and 3.7 percent for the same period of 1995.

3,"Automakers, eager to fill Americans' insatiable appetite for sport/utility vehicles, plan to introduce a variety of new models at next week's North American International Auto show here.
The annual festival in Detroit features new heights in size, style, luxury and refinement for the once-crude go-anywhere haulers.
Analysts are watching most closely the public reaction to Ford Motor Co.'s new luxury behemoth, the Lincoln Navigator, and Chrysler Corp.'s smaller Dodge Durango, which borrows its meaty front-end styling from the Dodge Dakota pickup truck.
But they also have their eyes on Subaru's new Forester, a car-based hybrid sport/utility vehicle that is among the first of a coming new breed of vehicles with truck-like bodies atop passenger car underpinnings.
The industry's continued fixation on sport/utility vehicles is understandable. U.S. compact sport/utility sales were the second-fastest growing segment in the industry in 1996, increasing 17.9 percent through November to 1,575,627 units and making up 11.3 percent of the market.
The only segment to grow faster was full-size sport/utility vehicles, up 51.5 percent to 379,260 vehicles through November.
""They're technically trucks, but a whole lot of people driving them don't know they're trucks,"" said James Holden, Chrysler's executive vice president of sales and marketing. ""The minivans and Jeeps are in suburban garages all over the place, so the definition of trucks is sort of blurring.""
In 1996, trucks, including sport/utility vehicles and minivans made up 66 percent of Chrysler's total vehicle sales.
The introduction of the Durango -- slightly larger than Ford's Explorer -- is expected to push that percentage even higher, and Holden said new sport/utility vehicles will push up other automakers' truck mix as well.
Ford is trying to push the luxury limits of the segment with the Navigator, a vehicle based on the F-150 pickup truck swathed in soft leather and likely to be priced in the same mid-$40,000 range as the Range Rover and Lexus LX450 vehicle.
Ford also is testing the consumer waters with two other concept sport/utilities, including an all-wheel drive version of its Taurus station wagon and a design study for a future Explorer model featuring more aggressive styling.
Mercedes-Benz also aims to whet the appetites of luxury sport/utility buyers by showing off the chassis for its Alabama-built M-Class sport/utility, which enters production next year. It is not showing off the vehicle's body, which is expected to be toned down from a concept vehicle shown at last year's show.
Mercedes also will spotlight a segment that has received little attention in recent years -- the luxury coupe -- by introducing its new CLK coupe to the world. The car borrows its elliptical headlamp styling from the larger E-Class sedan.
General Motors Corp., which dominated last year's show with the introduction of four new mid-size sedans, is expected to limit its splash to sports car buffs with the introduction of its first all-new Corvette in 14 years.
The fifth-generation plastic-bodied 'Vette is expected to offer more power and performance, but also more comfort and interior room for drivers and luggage.
More practical cars also are scheduled for introduction, including Ford's new Escort coupe, and Chrysler's next-generation LH family sedans -- the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde, LHS and Eagle Vision.
Toyota Motor Corp will unveil its first serious assault on the U.S. minivan market, an all-new U.S.-built minivan based on the Camry family sedan. The Toyota Sienna is scheduled for introduction later this year.
""This is the first real Japanese foray into a North American stronghold,"" said Michael Robinet, an auto analyst with CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich. ""Toyota has gone squarely after Chrysler's NS minivans.""
The Detroit auto show is open to the public Jan. 11 through Jan. 20.

3,"General Motors Corp.'s move to deflate Wall Street expectations about its fourth-quarter earnings will not likely be repeated by rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. analysts said Thursday.
GM told analysts Wednesday that its fourth-quarter North American incentive and other marketing costs were higher than earlier estimates, causing analysts to slash their estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars.
The automaker also said its product mix in Europe will be weaker than expected, with the low-margin Corsa subcompact making up a bigger portion of sales, and new product launch costs remain high.
As a result, many analysts slashed their estimates by 45 cents to 50 cents a share, helping to drive down GM stock by $1.375 over the past two days, to close at $54.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Burnham Securities analyst David Healy now estimates that GM will earn $435 million, or 52 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, excluding extraordinary items.
Among other items, GM plans to take a charge of $170 million, or 22 cents a share, to make lump-sum payments to United Auto Workers members as part of the company's new contract with the union.
GM also previously disclosed that strikes in the United States and Canada during the quarter reduced its fourth-quarter profit by about $700 million. In the fourth quarter of 1995, GM earned $1.87 billion, or $1.98 a share.
Analyst Michael Ward of brokerage PaineWebber Inc. said GM appears to be viewing the fourth quarter as a ""cleanup quarter"" and may accelerate some costs to help improve next year's results.
But analysts did not expect Ford and Chrysler to reveal similar surprises with marketing costs.
""Both Ford and Chrysler are more heavily weighted toward trucks,"" said brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons analyst Michael Braig. ""I don't know that I have to get any more sceptical than I have already been with them.""
Ford could earn as much as $1.25 billion, or $1.03 a share, in the fourth quarter before extraordinary items, according to a consensus estimate by First Call Corp., which tracks analyst forecasts. That total excludes an expected charge of $400 million, or 34 cents a share, to cover costs of an early retirement programme for salaried workers.
In the fourth quarter of 1995, new product launch costs held Ford's profit to $660 million, or 48 cents a share.
Although Ford continues to struggle with problems in Europe and Brazil, it is reaping benefits in North America from its new F-150 pickup truck, the new Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle and continued strong sales of the Explorer sport utility.
Ford said Thursday it sold 2 million trucks in a single year for the first time ever, including 800,000 F-Series trucks.
Lehman Brothers brokerage analyst Joseph Phillippi said Ford may announce another onetime charge for restructuring its European operations in the fourth quarter. Ford officials have declined to discuss plans for specific cost-cutting actions in Europe, but expect such actions to pay off in 1997.
Chrysler, which is enjoying a record sales year, is expected to cruise to a fourth-quarter profit of more than $1 billion, or about $1.40 a share, according to First Call. Driving the Chrysler earnings are strong sales of minivans, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles.
Chrysler chief economist Van Bussmann said Thursday that the automaker's market share, now at about 16 percent vs. 12 percent five years ago, should grow further in 1997. The automaker is introducing a new generation of large sedans and a new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle based on its new Dakota pickup truck.
"
3,"Adding to the controversy over the safety of automobile air bags, the federal government's auto safety agency said Thursday it was stepping up an investigation into spontaneous air bag deployments in several General Motors Corp. cars.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it has received five reports of air bags deploying without a collision in 1996-model GM mid-size sedans, due to corrosion in the air bag sensing and diagnostic module. In each case, water was spilled or leaked onto the floor of the vehicle.
The probe involves 395,994 cars currently on the road, including the 1996 Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo, Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.
In its monthly defect investigation report, NHTSA said three of the ""inappropriate deployments"" resulted in injuries, but none resulted in death. Four of the five cars were travelling between 10 and 40 mph when the bags inflated.
News of the probe comes as the NHTSA is fielding growing numbers of calls from consumers worried about reports of child deaths caused by air bags.
Air bags have saved the lives of more than 1,136 adults since 1986, said NHTSA spokeswoman Liz Neblett. But with inflation speeds of up to 200 mph, they also have killed 28 children since 1990.
Earlier this week, NHTSA Executive Director Ricardo Martinez said the the agency advised that all children under the age of 12 should ride in the back seats of cars and trucks equipped with dual front air bags.
The agency raised that age after 5-year-old Frances Ambrose was killed by an air bag in a Nashville, Tenn., crash despite properly wearing lap and shoulder belts.
The NHTSA is now considering several remedies to the situation, including an auto industry request to reduce the inflation pressure of passenger air bags.
Other alternatives include requiring ""smart"" air bag systems that have the ability to detect the size and weight of the occupant and adjust inflation accordingly.
In the probe of the GM cars, NHTSA said all of the vehicles use an air bag sensing and diagnostic module that is located underneath the front passenger seat on top of the carpeting. It is not sealed, making it susceptible to moisture intrusion.
NHTSA said owners of the vehicles reported that they:
-- Spilled a glass of water on the vehicle floor.
-- Drove through a car wash.
-- Spilled a bucket of water on the vehicle floor.
-- Spilled soapy water on the vehicle floor.
-- Discovered a trunk leak in the vehicle.
In addition, the agency said it was investigating two other instances of unexplained air bag deployment, one when a driver was backing out of a driveway and another when the car was driving at 20 mph.
A GM spokesman said the automaker was cooperating with the probe.
The company also uses the same air bag sensor on 1994 and 1995 model versions of the same cars, but reported only two instances of airbag deployments due to corrosion.
In one case, GM said the vehicle was apparently flooded by an ocean tide, and in another case, the entire rear end of the vehicle was severely corroded.
The investigation was upgraded to an engineering analysis, in which the agency will examine and physically test the components in question.

3,"Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday its U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.2 percent in November as a steep drop in car sales offset gains in trucks, capping off a disappointing month for the industry.
Earlier this week General Motors Corp. reported a 12 percent drop in November sales, while Chrylser Corp. reported a 1.4 percent increase.
Ford said it sold 290,774 cars and light trucks, compared with 297,362 a year earlier.
Domestic car sales fell 11.3 percent to 52,101 units, while light truck sales rose 5.7 percent to 175,606. Ford's import car sales fell 48.2 percent to 1,597.
""The retail market's shift from cars to light trucks not only has continued, but is gaining momentum as the year progresses,"" said Robert Rewey, Ford group vice president of sales and marketing.
Ford's combined Explorer, Mountaineer and Expedition sport utility vehicle sales rose 38 percent to 55,343 units. Rewey added that Ford planned to ease shortages of its four-wheel-drive vehicles by adding new component capacity in the first quarter of 1997.
But November sales of every Ford car line, except the Taurus mid-size sedan, declined from the year-ago period.
Taurus sales rose 9 percent to 31,017, enough to preserve the car's lead over the Honda Accord in the perennial duel for the best-selling car in the United States. So far this year, Americans have purchased or leased 363,077 Tauruses vs. 353,328 Accords and 335,906 Toyota Camrys.
Ford's sales brought total industry U.S. car and light truck sales for November to 1,125,582 vehicles, down 1.6 percent from the 1,144,448 units sold a year earlier.
The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for the month was 14.9 million units, compared with 14.8 million units a year earlier, and 14.9 million units for the month of October. The rate is calculated with seasonal factors supplied by the Commerce Department.
General Motors on Tuesday reported a 12 percent drop in November sales, fueled by strikes and model changeovers, while Chrylser reported a 1.4 percent increase in sales.
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. were the industry standouts, with sales gains of 19.6 percent and 15.5 percent, respectively.
Analysts said the lackluster November results for Detroit's Big Three automakers did not signal the start of a downturn in the U.S. vehicle market.
""I think one of the problems in November was that you had Thanksgiving late in the month, with only two selling days after it, compared to six last year,"" said Smith Barney auto analyst David Healy in New York.
""December seems to have gotten off to a good start, so I think we'er going to have a good close to the year,"" he said.
For the first 11 months of 1996, automakers sold 14,010,647 light vehicles, up 2.4 percent on a daily selling rate basis from the 13,590,795 sold a year earlier. Analysts predicted that the year-end total will be about 15.1 million to 15.2 million vehicles.
Automakers sold 486,407 North American-built cars in the United States in November, down 9.7 percent from a year ago. Domestic truck sales totaled 494,166 during November, up 5.6 percent from a year earlier.
"
3,"Lear Corp., furthering its quest to supply complete car interiors, said Friday it agreed to buy the instrument panel and trim parts unit of Denmark-based Borealis Holding AB.
Lear said it signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire Borealis Industrier AB for undisclosed terms.
Based in Gothenburg, Sweden, Borealis Industrier manufacturers instrument panels, door panels, climate systems, exterior trim and various other components for the European car and truck industry.
Borealis Industrier had 1995 sales of about $230 million and owns five plants in Sweden that employ about 1,800 people.
Primary customers for the business include Swedish carmakers AB Volvo and Saab Automobile AB and truckmaker Scania AB.
Borealis Holding is owned by Finnish state-controlled oil and energy group Neste Oy and Norwegian state-owned oil group Statoil AS.
Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by the Swedish competition authority and other conditions.
Lear said the acquisition supports its strategy of having in-house capability to provide total automotive interior systems, including instrument panels.
""Not only does this acquisition strengthen relations with our European customers, but it positions Lear as the only independent automotive supplier in the world with in-house capabilities in all five interior systems -- broadening the appeal of our already strong one-stop-shopping competitive advantage,"" Lear Chairman Kenneth Way said in a statement.
The deal is the latest of a series of consolidation moves in the automotive interior market. Lear earlier this year purchased carpet and floor-mat maker Masland Corp. for $384 million, and last year bought door panel and console maker Automotive Industries Inc for $626 million.
Lear's U.S. operations include the manufacturing of a wide range of automotive interior components.
The company's stock was unchanged Friday at $38 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lear's competitors are also pursuing the same acquisition strategy.
Johnson Controls Inc., which has a strong seating business, recently acquired interior parts maker Prince Automotive, based in Holland Mich., for $1.35 billion in cash.
Canada's Magna International Inc., one of the ""Big Three"" automotive interior firms along with Lear and Johnson Controls, recently acquired seat maker Douglas &amp; Lomason Co. for $135 million.
"
3,"Rested negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers met again Friday to make another push for agreement on a new national labour contract before a Saturday meeting of UAW leaders.
The bargainers went home without a deal Thursday night after meeting for nearly 32 hours, although some officials said the talks were grinding toward a settlement.
The negotiating session on Wednesday and Thursday was the longest since talks began between the automaker and union in June. Bargainers typically meet for long periods just prior to a tentative agreement.
""They're working on trying to resolve the final issues,"" GM spokesman Gerry Holmes said Friday.
Talks ""have snagged several times in the past week,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labour relations at the University of California-Berkeley. ""The pressure's been increased considerably by the two plants that are out on strike.""
The toll from local strikes in Janesville, Wis., and Indianapolis continued to mount as more plants shut down because of parts shortages.
GM's compact sport/utility plant in Moraine, Ohio, halted operations late Thursday night, idling 4,000 workers.
Seven other GM truck plants were expected to run out of doors, fenders and hoods made at the Indianapolis plant in the next few days. They include plants in Flint and Pontiac, Mich.; Shreveport, La.; Linden, N.J., Oshawa, Ontario, and Silao, Mexico.
Some states may determine that the laid-off workers will not be eligible for state unemployment benefits because they were idled by a strike.
The strikes on Tuesday by 2,750 workers at Indianapolis and 4,800 workers in Janesville, Wis., have formed a two-pronged effort to squeeze GM's highly profitable light truck operations, increasing pressure for national and local settlements.
Meanwhile, other UAW locals sought to join the Indianapolis and Janesville walkouts. GM's Kokomo, Ind., electronics plant requested permission to send about 5,500 workers out on strike.
A walkout at that facility would be particularly damaging to GM because it supplies all of the automaker's North American assembly plants with engine electronics, audio systems and other parts.
The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs.
"
3,"Workers at a key General Motors Corp. metal stamping plant in Indianapolis began returning to work on Sunday after ratifying a deal to end a five-day strike that threatened to paralyze most of the automaker's light truck production.
But a similar settlement eluded negotiators at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where a strike over local issues by 4,800 workers entered its sixth day. Janesville, which builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utility vehicles, is one of the automaker's most profitable factories.
The deal for 2,750 workers in Indianapolis, which came hours after GM and the UAW announced a tentative agreement for a new national labor contract early Saturday morning, calls for the hiring of 200 new workers at the plant.
Due to strong demand for GM's trucks, the plant has been working heavy overtime, which has put a strain on workers, causing them to seek relief.
GM also dropped its plans to change job classifications and seniority rules for skilled trades workers and will pay thousands of dollars to workers to settle grievances.
""I regret we did have to call a strike here,"" said UAW regional director Ron Gettlefinger in Indianapolis. ""I'm hoping other General Motors plants I'm responsible for will heed the seriousness of local agreements.""
The Indianapolis strike shut off shipments of fenders, doors,hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's North American light truck assembly plants. By the weekend, strike-caused parts shortages forced GM to shut down factories in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio and Linden, N.J.
Including the strikers at Janesville and Indianapolis, the UAW walkouts had idled over 19,000 workers, in addition to 18,958 GM workers still on layoff because of lingering parts shortages from a three-week Canadian Auto Workers strike, which ended Oct. 23.
UAW officials said stamping operations would resume Sunday night, with the plant back to full production by Monday. But that may not prove soon enough to keep other plants from running out of parts, including GM's full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Mich., which employs nearly 6,000 people.
Other plants that receive parts from Indianapolis are located in Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; and Silao, Mexico.
On Saturday, UAW President Stephen Yokich put GM on notice that some of the automaker's GM's 123 other locals may go on strike over lack of progress in local negotiations.
A clearer picture of the UAW-GM national agreement, which covers some 215,000 U.S. hourly workers, began to emerge Sunday. The contract meets the pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. on most major issues, including a guarantee that GM will maintain jobs for 95 percent of its current hourly workforce.
But the pact contains exceptions that will allow GM to sell some unprofitable parts plants, including a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.
The pact also is believed to contain complicated formulas that allow GM to shrink employment in certain businesses as workers retire.
""On the surface, it looks as though as it ought to be viewed by the investor community in a positive light."" said Lehman Brothers auto analyst Joseph Phillippi. ""GM's primary focus was to gain the ability to ride the attrition curve.""
On economics, the pact gives wokers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 2 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract. It also provides generous gains in pension benefits, including the elimination of a cap on outside earnings for retirees, which is viewed as a major incentive for older workers to leave the company.
Like Ford and Chrysler, GM will be able to trim jobs when it makes productivity improvements, and can pay workers in new auto parts businesses that it enters a lower wage than the standard $19 an hour paid by the Big Three.
GM has been trying to shed parts businesses as it tries to catch up to Chrysler's and Ford's efficiency levels. But the contract probably will not allow GM to shrink employment as much as it would like, said Eugene Jennings, a retired Michigan State University professor of management who is close to Detroit's Big Three automakers.
""GM is not going to get the competitive lift from labor in this contract,"" he said.
"
3,"Comerica Inc. said Wednesday it will cut 1,890 jobs, or about 16 percent of its work force, as part of an effort to slash costs and boost revenues by $110 million annually by the first half of 1998.
The Detroit-based banking company said the restructuring actions caused it to incur a $90 million pretax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings, which fell to $60.8 million, or 52 cents a share, from $106.5 million, or 92 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Comerica, with $34 billion in assets at the end of 1996, said the actual number of employees to be laid off may be less than 1,890 because of attrition, a hiring freeze and reinvestment actions.
The company has about 12,000 employees in Michigan, Texas, California and Florida. The cuts will fall in all four states and will take place between now and mid-1998, Comerica said.
""Regrettably, as we streamline processes and eliminate redundancies, a number of employees throughout the corporation will be displaced,"" Comerica Chairman Eugene Miller said in a statement. ""To assist these employees, we have put in place an enhanced severance plan with out placement services to help their transition.""
Comerica also said it planned to close about a dozen branch offices.
Comerica, Michigan's largest independent bank holding company, has been the subject of merger speculation in the past year. However, it has steadfastly maintained it is not interested in being acquired by an out-of-state bank and has instead embarked on a long effort to streamline its operations.
Comerica said the third phase of its restructuring effort includes other initiatives to reduce costs and enhance revenues. They include:
-- Eliminating one-third of paper forms and replacing them with electronic forms.
-- Simplifying the referral and delivery of investment services.
-- Giving branch employees more authority and reducing their clerical duties so they can serve customers better.
-- Reducing the documentation required to open a new account.
-- Streamlining the credit approval process.
-- Streamlining financial and operations reporting.
For the full year, Comerica earned $417.2 million, or $3.55 a share, up from $413.4 million, or $3.54 a share, in 1995.
"
3,"General Motors Corp. workers overwhelmingly ratified a new labour contract, the United Auto Workers union said Monday, capping a contentious bargaining season for the Big Three U.S. automakers.
The UAW said 85 percent of the hourly and skilled workers who voted approved the three-year pact, marking the largest approval margin in 20 years.
The pact marks the end of the union's national bargaining for more than 386,000 hourly workers at GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.. While the Ford and Chrysler talks hit minor snags, negotiations at GM ignited a national strike by the Canadian Auto Workers in October and local UAW strikes at two plants that stretched into November.
GM said last week the walkouts will reduce its fourth quarter profits by some $700 million, and other costs associated with the UAW pact will cost another $170 million.
GM's UAW contract follows the pattern set by Ford and Chrysler on most issues, including a guarantee that GM will maintain employment at 95 percent of its current UAW hourly work force of 215,000 people.
All three pacts offer workers about $13,900 over the life of the agreement, including $2,000 lump-sum payments in the first year and 3 percent base wage increases in the second and third years.
But the GM pact also includes some tougher restrictions aimed at preventing the shifting of parts work to outside suppliers.
In return, the world's largest automaker gained the ability to drop below the 95 percent level when it makes productivity improvements -- a big factor given the many new car and truck models GM will introduce in the next few years.
GM also gained flexibility to transfer workers more freely between plants and retained its ability to sell some unprofitable factories. The company will proceed with plans to sell a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., GM spokesman Charles Licari said.
""We have the ability to execute our business plan,"" Licari said. ""We have the ability to reduce employment through productivity gains and attrition.""
He declined to say how many jobs GM hopes to eliminate over the life of the agreement. Analysts estimate that if GM is allowed to shrink by its normal retirement rate of about 5 percent a year, it could cut 30,000 jobs.
""We believe that it is a fair and equitable agreement that provides additional job security as well as economic and benefit enhancements for our employees while giving GM the flexibility that it needs to be more competitive in the future,"" Licari said.
The 85 percent approval margin for the GM contract was higher than any ratification vote since 1976, when 86.9 percent of GM's production workers and 69 percent of a smaller group of skilled workers approved the pact.
Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said the 1996 contract should allow GM to become much more competitive than it could under the previous agreement.
""I think GM won this time around, as opposed to 1993. The key here is they have gained the ability to ride the attrition curve,"" he said.
But GM still faces a major hurdle in negotiating plant-level labour agreements at the vast majority of its 123 UAW locals. UAW officials have said GM could face more local strikes, and such agreements could make it more difficult to reduce employment at each individual plant.
Ford and Chrysler achieved labour peace in their agreements, but they also are likely to have some flexibility to exit certain unprofitable businesses, Phillippi said.
"
48,"A monster shakeup of Canada's biggest city, Toronto, has sparked a citizens' revolt against Ontario's ruling Conservatives and raised eyebrows among those who do business in the country's financial capital.
This clean, peaceful city -- sometimes dubbed ""New York run by the Swiss"" -- has recently become a battleground in the so-called ""Common Sense Revolution"" initiated by Ontario's Conservative Premier Mike Harris.
Promising leaner, cheaper government, Harris wants to merge Toronto and six neighbouring municipalities into a single ""megacity"" of 2.4 million people. The new city would hold about 8 percent of Canada's 30 million people and dwarf all but three of Canada's 10 provinces.
Harris also plans a fundamental shift in how public services -- everything from education to welfare -- are delivered and paid for.
Opponents fear the municipal reform blitz will drive up taxes and lead to the kind of urban decay witnessed in many cities in the United States, just across the border.
The threat of such wrenching change being rammed through without a binding plebiscite has outraged citizens and prompted accusations of tyranny and fascism.
""Government is not elected for the politicians. It is elected by the people for the people,"" Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall told a crowd after residents in the seven affected areas voted three to one against a merger in a referendum earlier this month. The vote was not binding on Ontario's government, which has vowed to press ahead with its plan.
The referendum capped a campaign that saw an Ontario cabinet minister likened to Adolf Hitler, bomb threats against a polling firm, and thousands of protesters marching in the streets in a re-enactment of a civic rebellion in 1837.
Harris has held firm. ""I don't think we can withdraw the need for change,"" he said, adding that there may be amendments when the legislation is introduced.
The ""megacity"" revolt has grabbed headlines across the country and overseas, even prompting some foreign consulates to keep a wary eye on the political wrangling.
""There is some interest, but it's purely because it has appeared in the (British) papers,"" said Terry Curran, the British Consul in Toronto.
Meanwhile, high-profile Canadian business leaders, politicians and artists have joined to oppose the merger plan.
They include film director Norman Jewison, Molson Cos. Ltd Chief Executive Norman Seagram, and writer Margaret Atwood who compared the megacity's architects to the Three Stooges.
The ""No"" side captured 75 percent of the votes in the referendum, but the process was flawed and turnout was low.
Under draft legislation, known as Bill 103, the seven city halls and 106 politicians who now govern the Greater Toronto Area will shrink to one elected mayor and 44 councillors.
The government also plans to overhaul property taxes, eliminate more than half of the province's school boards, seize control of education funding and download a bigger share of social programme costs onto the municipalities.
Harris has said the reforms are revenue neutral, but critics say municipalities may be forced to raise taxes.
They fear welfare rolls could soar and one of the hardest hit communities would be Toronto, which has a heavier welfare caseload and nearly half of the province's social housing.
""You're doing something that is very volatile and on a tax base which has very little flexibility,"" said George Fierheller, president of Toronto's Board of Trade.
More than 75 percent of the board's members favour reducing the size of government through a merger but nearly half worry about dumping such heavy responsibilities onto municipalities.
""As a Torontonian and a businessman responsible for a large company, I'm wary of abrupt change without making sure you've thought it through,"" said Peter Godsoe, chairman of Canada's fourth-largest bank, Bank of Nova Scotia.
The influential debt rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, has warned ""the very nature and scale of the reforms...create new challenges that could affect the credit quality of some municipalities.""
The downloading trend has been a feature of government at all levels in Canada as they struggle with budget deficits.
Ontario is in a tougher bind than most. Faced with a huge C$10 ($7.38) billion deficit when they came to power in 1995, the Conservatives slashed spending and cut the deficit to C$7.7 billion in 1996/97, while easing some taxes.
The Harris revolution has kept the government high in opinion polls, but public support has slipped recently, with backing for the Conservatives down to 37 percent in Metro Toronto, compared with 41 percent for the opposition Liberals.

48,"Canada's financial markets gave an approving nod to Finance Minister Paul Martin's stay-the-course 1997/98 budget on Tuesday, with some analysts expecting a modest rally on Wednesday.
In what is expected to be an election year, the Liberal government said it will maintain pressure on the deficit while offering minor tax cuts and new spending.
Economists said Martin's assumptions on interest rates and economic growth were prudent and should enable the government to beat its fiscal targets.
""What you're going to see tomorrow? A flow of funds into the Canadian dollar briefly, quite possibly the bond market, quite possibly the stock market,"" said Bob Boaz, director of research for HSBC James Capel Canada Inc.
But analysts predicted the markets would settle down quickly as most of the budget details were widely expected.
""There was no big news in this budget. But he (Martin) didn't relax his fiscal resolve and that will be well received by the markets,"" said John Anania, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest bank.
The budget had little immediate impact on the Canadian dollar, but currency traders said they expect the unit to strengthen overnight on Martin's favorable deficit targets.
Martin predicted the deficit for 1996/97 would be no more that C$19 billion, compared to a projected C$24.3 billion. The deficit is seen falling to C$17 billion in 1997/98.
In early evening trading, the Canadian dollar firmed slightly to C$1.3534 (US$0.7388) from closing levels at C$1.3546 (US$0.7382).
""We expect the Canadian dollar to appreciate overnight as a result of the positive budget,"" said John Nicholson, managing director of Scotia Capital Markets.
Canadian bonds strengthened shortly after the budget's release as the market welcomed news of only modest new spending initatives.
Some bond analysts expressed concern that Martin did not set a target for balancing the country's books, but overall they expected a neutral reaction to the budget on Wednesday.
""He's made some extremely conservative assumptions, we believe, with interest rates and growth that lead us to conclude he will continue to outperform his own targets,"" said Hank Cunningham, director of fixed income with First Marathon Securities.
The budget is expected to be well received on Canada's biggest stock market on Wednesday, after the Toronto Stock Exchange enjoyed record gains on Tuesday, analysts said.
Before the budget's release, the TSE's key 300 index posted its ninth record close of 1997, up 20 points to 6238.22. Trading was heavy with turnover of 138.4 million shares worth C$2.52 billion, the TSE's second highest value ever.
Martin did not impose new corporate, personal or excise tax increases, but the government did extend a special capital tax on Canada's big banks for another year.

48,"Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves is expected to deliver more good news on the province's deficit when he delivers the 1997/98 budget next month.
Economists said on Monday a brighter fiscal picture may allow Eves to speed up implementing the second stage of a promised 30 percent income tax cut.
Eves earlier said the 1997/98 budget for the fiscal year ended March 31 will be released on May 6.
It is the ruling Conservatives' second full budget since they swept to power in Canada's most-populous province in 1995.
In February, Eves revised the 1996/97 budget deficit to C$7.67 billion, down C$508 million from his original budget forecast.
Economists said a strong economy and a C$650 million contingency reserve could lower the final 1996/97 deficit figure to around C$7 billion.
They said Eves should also better his C$6.6 billion deficit forecast for 1997/98.
""Given the strength we've seen in the economy in recent months and improved prospects for the rest of 1997. It may come in even below that (C$6 billion) level,"" said Nesbitt Burns senior economist Doug Porter.
The government's contingency reserve is used to reduce the deficit if it is not needed for unexpected spending needs.
Royal Bank of Canada economist Craig Wright said he also expected a deficit of around C$7 billion in 1996/97, falling to about C$6 billion in 1997/98.
""They have used relatively conservative economic assumptions and contingency reserves and it shouldn't be a problem hitting next year's target and maybe going lower,"" Wright said.
In his third quarter report last February, Eves said government revenues grew faster than projected due to a rebounding economy, almost C$1.2 billion higher than forecast.
He said the first stage of the government's 30 percent income tax cut had helped boost consumer confidence in Ontario. About half od the tax reduction has been implemented, with the remaining 15 percent due by 1999.
The province's improving finances has led to speculation that Eves may accelerate the timing of remaining tax cuts.
""Usually where there is smoke there is fire and they (the government) have certainly been quite forward talking about that possibility. It wouldn't be a big surprise if they did accelerate it,"" Porter said.
Wright said the government's negotiations with Ontario's municipalities on the funding of services may prevent a speedier tax cut.

48,"Bre-X Minerals Ltd. chief geologist Michael de Guzman, who co-discovered the richest gold find this century, may have committed suicide when he fell out of a helicopter on Wednesday, a company spokesman said on Thursday.
Rescue crews were still searching the dense Borneo rain forest for de Guzman's body after he plunged 800 feet from a helicopter en route to the Busang site in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province.
Bre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty said company officials obtained a copy of an apparent suicide note found by Indonesian police among de Guzman's belongings.
""Mike did leave a note. Basically the upshot of it is Mike had just learned that he had hepatitis B. The prognosis was not good due to the fact that he had suffered many bouts of malaria which had weakened his system over the years,"" McAnulty said in a telephone interview.
""We understand the prognosis was not good for recovery and apparently there was a lot of pain involved and he decided he did not want to go through that,"" McAnulty said.
He added that foul play was not suspected and Indonesian police were treating his death as suicide.
The 40-year-old Filipino geologist was a key member of the team that discovered Busang a few years ago.
Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X has agreed to develop the Busang site, valued at $25 billion, with U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. and Indonesian partners.
De Guzman, a 20-year mining industry veteran, was also credited with co-discovering the large Dizon copper-gold deposit in the Phillipines.
John Felderhof, Bre-X's senior vice-president of exploration, was traveling to Indonesia to replace de Guzman at scheduled meetings with Freeport-McMoRan.
The incident was the latest tragedy involving Canadian mining companies in far-flung corners of the world.
In October 1995, nine employees of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corp. were killed in a helicopter crash in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan.
The Kyrgyzstan Air helicopter, chartered by a Cameco unit, was en route from the Kumtor gold mine when it went down.
The families of the nine Canadians killed in the crash have filed a C$20.7 million ($15.1 million) lawsuit alleging Cameco and other defendants were negligent.
In September 1996, Falconbridge Ltd. Chief Executive Franklin Pickard died of a heart attack when visiting the Toronto-based company's copper site high in Chile's Andes Mountains.
Bre-X's stock rose C20 cents to C$17.45 on the Toronto Stock Echange on Thursday.
"
48,"The Busang gold discovery in Indonesia -- touted by Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining"" according to a report released on Sunday.
In a stunning report to Bre-X, consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X core samples taken from the Busang site, located deep in the jungles of Borneo.
""The magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we believe has occurred and resulting falsification of assay values at Busang, is of a scale and over a period of time and with a precision that, to our knowledge, is without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world,"" the report said.
Strathcona said it did not find an economic gold deposit in the southeast zone of the Busang property, the area claimed by Bre-X to contain about 71 million ounces of gold. The report said an economic deposit was unlikely.
The Toronto Stock Exchange said on Sunday that it would halt trading in Bre-X shares on Monday ""in light of the extremely negative report from Strathcona.""
Bre-X's stock closed up 19 cents (14 cents) at C$3.23 ($2.34) on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday.
Bre-X chairman David Walsh, the maverick mining executive who gambled his last C$10,000 ($7,200) on finding Busang, said the company was ""devastated"" by Strathcona's findings.
""We share the shock and dismay of our shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there,"" Walsh said in a statement on Sunday.
As the fallout from Sunday's announcement reverberated through the world mining community, Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X's Calgary headquarters where shareholders and reporters had gathered.
""I think our press release says it all for now,"" he said.
The report spells the end of Bre-X, said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements Canada in Toronto.
""Bre-X has got nothing, that's what it means,"" Ing said in a telephone interview. ""They've got nothing but lawsuits on their hands,"" he said.
With billions of dollars in limbo, nervous shareholders have traded rumors for weeks on Internet chat sites while they waited for the Strathcona report.
Some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the recent turmoil now lay the blame at Walsh's feet.
""He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law,"" Chris Laughren, a  construction worker, told Reuters on Sunday as he waited outside Bre-X's headquarters.
Laughren said he has lost C$7,500 ($5,400) on Bre-X stock, or ""three months work down the drain.""
Walsh said in a statement on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X's remaining assets ""for the benefit of the shareholders.""
A penny-stock exploration firm before it discovered Busang in 1993, Bre-X quickly became the darling of the Toronto Stock Exchange amid glowing reports of Busang's potential.
But rumors began swirling around Bre-X and its Busang deposit after the March 19 apparent suicide of Bre-X's top geologist in Indonesia.
Michael de Guzman allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter while en route to a meeting with officials at Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc, one of Bre-X's partners in the Busang project.
A week later on March 26, New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan said that its preliminary tests found ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
The reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Bre-X's head of exploration John Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman. The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin, a unit of Montreal-based SNC Lavalin Inc. Kilborn has already said it was not responsible for sampling.
After the Freeport-McMoRan report Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona, a well-respected Canadian mining consulting firm, to review its Busang project.
The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion U.S.) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11).
A Freeport spokesman said on Sunday the company had no immediate comment, but would release a statement before North American financial markets opened on Monday.
""Our response is we're aware Bre-X has released a news release,"" spokesman Garland Robinette said.
Freeport said last month it would ""elect to participate in the Busang project only if development is, in (Freeport's) opinion, economically feasible.""
Disgruntled shareholders have already launched at least eight class action lawsuits.
The Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's top securities regulator, is investigating Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws.
Increasing attention is being paid to personal trades by Walsh, his wife and other company officials in 1996, which netted them about C$77 million ($55 million).
Less than a year ago, Bre-X was the target of an intense bidding war as several heavyweight mining firms battled for control of possibly the world's richest gold discovery.

48,"Toronto stocks soared to new highs on Wednesday as foreign investors jumped into Canada's financial markets, lured by falling interest rates and the recovering economy.
Shares in Canada's big six banks hit 52-week highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, propelling the country's biggest stock market to its 53rd record close of 1996.
The Canadian dollar has also surged this week, hitting its strongest level in a year.
Declining interest rates, low inflation and falling budget deficits have combined to make Canada the flavor of the month, economists said.
""Overall, foreign investors have just become enamoured with Canada as a place for investment,"" Michael Gregory, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.
The Toronto Stock Exchange index of 300 stocks jumped 85.45 points to close at 5,749.92, fuelled by brisk action in interest-rate sensitive issues such as banks and utilities.
The index has gained more than 20 percent this year, compared to 20.7 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average and 17.6 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.
The Bank of Canada is expected to cut interest rates again as early as this week. The central bank has cut rates 19 times since May 1995 in a bid to revive a sluggish economy.
Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said on Wednesday that Canada's improving economy gives the central bank more latitude to set Canadian rates independent of U.S. rates.
He added Canada is now in a better position to withstand a hike in U.S. rates than it has been in recent years.
""The economic outlook is favourable. We will soon see signs of the payoff for the difficult restructuring decisions taken in both the private and public sectors,"" Thiessen said.
After several years of belt tightening, Canadian governments have either balanced their budgets or are on track to wipe out huge deficits.
Canada's 1.2 percent inflation rate is one of the lowest in the world and less than half the U.S. rate.
Several Canadian banks cut residential mortgage rates on Wednesday to levels not seen in about three decades.
Gregory said he expected Canada to continue to outperform the United States on the rate front and that offshore investors recognised that.
""I think investors are coming to terms with the fact that Canadian interest rates -- because of low inflation and improving currency prospects -- should be below U.S. rates,"" he said. ""Many investors are jumping on that and the Canadian dollar is undervalued. It's cheap.""
The Canadian currency closed around C$1.3312 (75 cents) Wednesday after trading around C$1.3300 earlier in the session.
In stock trading, TSE's financial services group jumped 2.5 percent after soaring 3 percent Tuesday. Declining interest rates make bank lending more profitable and bank dividends more attractive for investors.
Soaring bank profits have also lured investors. The major banks report their year-end results in a few weeks and are on track for a third straight year of record profits.
Recent listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile in the United States where they are considered cheap compared with U.S. bank stocks.
New York-based Morgan Stanley issued a recommendation on two Canadian banks on Tuesday and predicted a strong fourth quarter for the entire group.

48,"David Walsh, the maverick Canadian embroiled in the world's biggest gold fiasco, always dreamed of striking it rich.
Under siege since doubts about Busang deposit surfaced in late March, Walsh had dismissed the conspiracy and tampering theories that have dogged his company Bre-X Minerals Ltd. -- until now.
""We share the shock and dismay our of shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there,"" Walsh said after his company released a devastating report on Busang on Sunday.
In an interim report to Bre-X, consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said the company's data on Busang was falsified on a scale ""without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world.""
It is a stunning conclusion to a mystery that has gripped the world mining community in recent months.
Walsh, 51, has made millions of dollars and appeared on the covers of national magazines since his Calgary, Alberta -based exploration company announced its 1993 Busang gold discovery in Indonesia.
""I'm nuts. I'm looking for the bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow,"" the beefy stock promoter, who lives in the Bahamas, told a Canadian magazine earlier this year.
Veteran Calgary journalist Jim Bentein, who covered Bre-X since its early days on the Alberta Stock Exchange, has described Walsh as ""a sophisticated trucker,"" who is as comfortable having a beer and a smoke in a bar as he is in financial circles.
After the Strathcona report, some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the turmoil now blamed Walsh.
""He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law,"" Chris Laughren, a  construction worker, told Reuters on Sunday as he waited anxiously outside Bre-X's headquarters in Calgary.
Laughren said he has lost C$7,500 ($5,400) on Bre-X stock, or ""three months work down the drain.""
Walsh said on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X's assets ""for the benefit of the shareholders.""
Raised in a wealthy suburb of Montreal, Walsh followed his father and grandfather into the stock business.
He joined a small trust company shortly after graduating from high school. In 1976 he moved to brokerage Midland Doherty Ltd. (now Midland Walwyn Capital Inc.) and rose to vice president in its institutional equity sales department.
In the 1980s Midland moved Walsh to Calgary, but he left the company shortly afterward to set up his own company, Bresea Resources Ltd.
After dabbling unsuccessfully in oil and gas, Walsh created Bre-X Minerals Ltd. in 1989 and ventured into mining. But by 1993 his exploration efforts had dried up.
He and his wife declared bankruptcy in 1993 after accumulating almost C$60,000 ($43,800) in debt on 15 credit cards.
""We had these claims which were worthless, and no money,"" Walsh said in an interview earlier this year.
Almost broke, he scraped together C$10,000 ($7,300) to start exploring in Indonesia, pursuading friends to invest C$200,000 ($146,000) for a stake in the area now known as the central Busang in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province.
Walsh hit the jackpot with Busang, and Bre-X quickly became the darling of the world's mining community.
""There's nothing like success. Our other explorations have been zero. I had never imagined it would be this big,"" he said.
Walsh, his wife and other company officials added more than C$37 million ($27 million) to their bank accounts after they sold Bre-X stock at prices ranging from C$24.40 ($17.81) to C$28.40 ($20.73) between August and October 1996.
But the sales were controversial because they occurred shortly after Bre-X learned its preliminary license had been cancelled by the Indonesian government, a development the company did not reveal publicly until October 1996.
As the fallout from Sunday's announcement reverberated through the world mining community, Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X's Calgary headquarters.
""I think our press release says it all for now,"" he said.

48,"Canadian brewing giant Molson Cos. Ltd., flush with cash from the sale of non-beer assets, said on Wednesday that it is seeking expansion opportunities in China and Latin America.
Despite shareholder pressure for a stock buyback, Molson said it wants to grow its core brewing business.
""We are looking strongly at Latin American and Chinese markets. Any sizable investment we would make would be with partners or as a joint venture,"" new President and Chief Executive Norman Seagram told reporters after the company's annual meeting in Montreal.
The meeting marked the launch of Seagram's bid to return to the company's 210-year-old brewing roots after a failed foray into speciality chemicals.
""J'aime la biere (I love beer),"" Seagram, a brewing industry veteran, told shareholders.
He said the board is not considering a share buyback, but will spend the next three months scouring the world for brewing opportunities.
Analysts and investors, worried about the company's spotty track record on acquisitions, fear Molson will pay too much.
""The question is, 'Can Molson invest the money more wisely than shareholders?' That's what we're trying to figure out,"" said Michael Palmer, an analyst with Toronto-based Equity Research Associates.
Molson's class A stock closed down C$0.30 (22 cents) at C$20.20 ($15) on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The stock has wallowed around C$20 ($15) since buyback speculation pushed the shares to C$25 ($18) earlier this year.
Last winter's sale of Diversey Corp., a speciality chemicals firm, was part of a wider restructuring that will add almost C$1 billion ($729 million) to Molson's coffers.
Molson is still looking for a buyer for its retail assets, which include stakes in Home Depot Inc..'s Canadian unit, and home improvement chain Groupe Val Royal Inc. Molson also owns Beaver Lumber Co.
The Toronto-based holding company will be left with a 40 percent stake in Molson Breweries, Canada's biggest brewer, which makes Molson Canadian, Golden and Red Dog.
It also owns the famed Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League and the Molson Centre in which the club plays.
Molson officials have expressed interest in buying a larger stake in Molson Breweries, which is also owned 40 percent by Australia's Foster's Brewing Group Ltd. and 20 percent by Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s Miller Brewing unit.
But Seagram said ""Foster's has indicated no wish to change its 40 percent partnership in Molson Breweries and we continue to work with both Foster's and Miller.""
That leaves the international market, and analysts said quality brewing assets will fetch a high price.
China and Latin America are fast-growing beer markets compared with North America, where beer consumption has been flat for several years, said William Chisholm, an analyst with Deacon Capital Corp.
""There certainly is a lot of scope to put money in there, but whether you can make a worthwhile investment is another thing,"" he said.
Analysts said investors are nervous due to the experience of other Canadian brewers in foreign markets.
Molson's arch-rival, Labatt Brewing Co. Ltd., pushed into Mexico with much fanfare in 1994, acquiring 22 percent of FEMSA Cerveza, the brewing unit of food giant Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A. de C.V. for C$720 million ($512 million).
Soon afterward, a Mexican currency crisis forced a large writedown on Labatt's investment. The Mexican deal and other diversification moves angered Labatt's institutional shareholders.
The Canadian brewer subsequently lost its independence after Belgian brewer Interbrew S.A. won a takeover battle for Labatt last summer.
FEMSA Cerveza has since performed better and Labatt has opted for smaller investments through joint ventures.
In China, Canadian brewer Noble China Inc. brews one of the country's most popular foreign brands, Pabst Blue Ribbon, in a joint venture with the Chinese government.
But the company has been hurt by a legal dispute with a former executive and market share in China has dropped due to smuggling of bootleg Pabst beer.

48,"Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's two largest banks, wrapped up the industry's third-quarter profit parade on Thursday with sharply higher earnings.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest bank, said income climbed 12 percent to C$358 million ($261 million) in the three months ended July 31.
CIBC, Canada's second largest bank, reported a 24 percent jump in income to C$336 million ($245 million).
CIBC's earnings per share of C$1.50 ($1.09) beat analysts' forecasts of around C$1.43 ($1.04) a share. Royal Bank reported a C$1.02 ($0.74) per share profit, in line with analysts' expectations.
The results capped a strong quarter for the six major banks and put them on track for a third straight year of record annual profits.
The group rang up a combined profit of C$5.17 billion ($3.7 billion) in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31.
Soaring bank profits have sparked hostility from Canadian consumers who complain about high service fees and tight lending policies.
In a bid to soften that criticism, the banks have taken to highlighting their tax bills and job creation efforts.
For example, CIBC said it paid out more than C$0.50 ($0.36) in taxes for every dollar earned so far this year.
The group's public relations efforts may get easier next year when analysts predict earnings growth will start to tail off.
In the third quarter, CIBC and Royal Bank gained from stronger loan volumes, higher brokerage and fee revenues and improving credit quality.
""Our solid performance this quarter reflects the continued strong contribution from our core businesses,"" CIBC chairman and chief executive officer Al Flood said in a statement.
The bank's return on equity, a key measure of profitability, was 16.6 percent in the third quarter, up from 13.7 in the same quarter last year.
Flood said CIBC's personal and commercial bank continued its strong performance this year.
Recent strategic moves at CIBC's brokerage unit, CIBC Wood Gundy, are also paying off wth new financial products and high-yield debt adding to the bank's bottom line.
Stronger revenues from underwriting, capital markets and foreign exchange pushed non-interest income up 17 percent to C$691 million ($504 million) in the third quarter.
Net interest income was up slightly to C$1.1 billion ($800 million) in the third quarter.
At Royal Bank, higher revenues from capital market, mutual fund and trading businesses pushed other income up 13 percent to C$757 million ($552 million).
Net interest income climbed three percent to C$1.1 billion ($800 million), due mostly to higher asset volumes, lower impaired loans and proceeds from the sale of bonds.
""This quarter was marked by higher growth in residential mortgages and other loans, continued improvement in credit quality and stronger performances from a number of fee-based businesses,"" said Royal Bank chairman John Cleghorn.
Royal Bank's return on equity was 17.2 percent compared to 16.4 percent in the third quarter of 1995.
Despite the strong performance, shares in both banks finished weaker on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce fell C$0.30 ($0.22) to C$45.15 ($32.80), while Royal Bank lost C$0.20 ($0.14) to close at C$34.20 ($25).

48,"Shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd. soared on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday as rumors continued to swirl around the Busang gold deposit and analysts sifted through drill results from the site.
The Calgary, Alberta-based company's stock jumped C$1.22 to close at C$3.62 on massive turnover of 17 million shares on Canada's biggest stock market.
Frenzied late afternoon trading pushed the volatile stock to a session high of C$5.75.
Bre-X has been embroiled in controversy since preliminary tests by its partner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., on the gold property indicated the deposit may contain ""insignificant"" amounts of gold.
The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, from the company's stock market value.
Reports on Wednesday that Freeport recently received the first independent tests of the Busang deposit by a Canadian firm were challenged by Freeport and Bre-X officials.
The reports said Freeport received the tests while Freeport Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett was in Indonesia and held meetings with President Suharto.
""The testing is still going on and Freeport has not been informed of any assay results,"" Freeport spokeswoman Kristen Lemkau told Reuters by telephone.
Bre-X commissioned Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. last month to conduct an audit of its Busang project. The results are expected in early May.
""The audit was commissioned by Bre-X and it is going to be submitted to Bre-X,"" said Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool, adding that it was Bre-X that would release the audit results.
Bre-X late on Tuesday released drill results from 22 holes at the Busang property that were not included in its resource calculation of 70.95 million ounces of gold released on February 17.
Bre-X said 16 holes produced values ranging from 1.05 grams per tonne to 7.58 grams per tonne, while six holes showed no significant amount of gold.
""They were sort of old holes, but I think investors are taking it positively,"" said one mining analyst.
John Kaiser, editor of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, said the drill results released on Tuesday were positive, but not enough to quash the controversy surrounding Busang.
He said the final word on Busang was still up to two weeks away.
""We need to know what the numbers for this deposit run as produced by strictly controlled sampling, drilling and assaying procedures. Until we get a batch of results where we know that there is nothing screwy along the way, everything is uncertain,"" Kaiser said.
The Busang saga took another curious twist on Wednesday when an Indonesian company linked to President Suharto raised its stake in the Busang property.
Nusamba Group, 80 percent-owned by three foundations headed by President Suharto, raised its stake in the main Busang II section to 25 percent. Pt Askatindo Karya Minerals reduced its stake to five percent from 15 percent, said a spokesman for the family-owned company.
Bre-X has a 45 percent stake in Busang, Freeport has 15 percent and the Indonesian government 10 percent.
"
27,"An influential Japanese government panel on Thursday called for a fundamental change in the nation's land policies, arguing that the old concept of trying to hold down land values was out of date.
Real estate values have plummeted since the bursting in the early 1990s of Japan's ""bubble"" of inflated asset prices.
The panel called for an ""appropriate"" tax on landholdings in line with balanced assessments of value.
To promote more liquidity in real estate holdings it recommended securitisation and promotion of joint ventures.
It also called for steps to encourage small landowners to sell their land or cooperate in development projects in order for large-scale development to take place in big cities.
Analysts and real estate industry sources said, however, that the panel failed to make specific proposals that would help end the long slump in the real estate market.
""Nobody in the government or politicians have yet formed a clear policy to solve the slump in the real estate market and falling land prices,"" said a real estate industry source.
Some experts said a change in taxation is the most important step that needs to be taken.
""While the panel makes wide-ranging proposals, it is somewhat disappointing that the panel did not make specific proposals on taxes on land (holdings and transactions),"" said Keiko Otsuki, a senior analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.
It is Japan's first review of land policy in five years.
The panel said in its proposals to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that land prices had fallen to a point where the price surges in the latter half of the bubble had been offset after a five-year slump.
Emergency intervention measures to curb land prices adopted in 1991 are no longer needed as they are still falling, it said.
Banks and non-bank financial institutions have been reeling from property-related bad loans, a factor blocking a smooth supply of funds to the real estate market and strong economic recovery.
The proposals follow a request by Hashimoto in April for a review of Japan's land policy to cope with structural changes such as falling land prices, growing numbers of people leaving the Tokyo metropolitan area and a rapid rise in the proportion of old people in the population.

27,"Japan's troubled banks, which once turned a cold shoulder to foreign suitors, now appear ready to welcome foreign acquisitions that might help them survive an impending industry shake-out.
But foreigners are likely to be hesitant about tying the knot, industry sources and analysts said, given insufficient disclosure of bad loans at Japanese banks and the lack of a clear system in Japan to deal with losses at failed banks.
A Finance Ministry official added that, while links with foreign firms may help Japan's banks weather the ""Big Bang"" financial reforms planned by 2001, Japanese institutions would have to get their houses in order before entering such unions.
""Japanese banks are busy cleaning up their bad-loan mess right now,"" Sei Nakai, a deputy director general of the ministry's banking bureau, said in an interview.
Japan's hopes for a few foreign white knights were apparent when troubled Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) on Monday announced a radical restructuring programme, including a withdrawal from overseas operations.
President Hiroshi Kubota told reporters that the scheme would help make his bank more attractive for a tie-up or a merger with a foreign firm.
""In order to meet new challenges, there would be nothing wrong with a foreign bank taking us under its wing and bringing in a blue-eyed president,"" he said.
""We've even been talking to (foreigners) about a tie-up.... They express interest, but say we should first clean house,"" he added.
But David Threadgold, an analyst at BZW Securities, doubted such offers would come rushing in.
""This is an unprofitable banking market -- overcapacity, overregulated. I'm not sure there is going to be a big queue (to buy NCB or other Japanese banks).""
An executive at a foreign investment bank echoed this sentiment. ""While we are committed to remaining an active player in cash-rich Japanese markets, where individual assets total 1,200 trillion yen, we are not interested in making an unprofitable investment,"" he said.
Some Japanese industry sources said, however, that recent approaches by foreign firms belied such aloof talk.
A U.S. bank made overtures last year to Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd about a possible takeover, while a European investment bank was reported to have made inquiries about acquiring a troubled small bank in northern Japan, they said.
On Monday, however, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank announced a merger with a regional bank, Hokkaido Bank Ltd.
The sources also said a major concern among foreign firms was insufficient disclosure by Japanese banks of problem loans backed by collateralised land, which became a heavy burden after a land and share price bubble burst in the early 1990s.
While the Finance Ministry said that problem loans at Japan's deposit-taking institutions totalled 29 trillion yen at the end of last September, Moody's Investors Service estimated the actual amount was at least three times larger.
""To exaggerate somewhat, under the Japanese criteria all loans are innocent unless proven guilty. Under the U.S. criteria, however, all commercial real estate secured loans are guilty unless proven innocent,"" it said in a recent report.
Personnel issues are also likely to make foreign firms think twice about uniting with Japanese banks, analysts said.
""No shareholder (of a foreign bank) would stand for it. Little specific pieces (of a bank's assets) could be attractive, but why would they want to buy a business when you can't reduce staff?"" said a foreign analyst.

27,"A loan-collecting body said on Tuesday it was seeking the involuntary bankruptcy of a major real estate firm, the latest shock to the country's financial system from the long-running ""jusen"" mortgage firm scandal.
If Osaka-based Sueno Kosan were declared bankrupt it would be one of the biggest Japanese business failures on record, financial industry sources said. The firm has estimated total liabilities of 670 billion yen ($5.87 billion).
The sources said the bankruptcy could lead to problems at financial firms that have loaned money to Sueno Kosan.
The bankruptcy request was made to the Osaka District Court by the semi-governmental Housing Loan Administration Corp (HLAC), set up to collect problem loans run up by the ""jusen"" group of home loan firms.
Sueno Kosan is a major borrower from the ""jusen"" mortgage firms, which collapsed under the weight of rash property loans made during the ""bubble"" economy of the 1980s.
Finance Minister Wataru Kubo also said the Sueno Kosan problem was likely to spread to financial firms that had lent it money. ""However, such an impact will be resolved among related financial institutions in accordance with our financial system,"" he said.
Jitters about problems in the banking industry helped push up the price of Japanese government bonds to record levels on Tuesday.
The filing was somewhat expected. Kohei Nakabo, president of the HLAC, told reporters recently the body was considering taking such action.
Japanese media reported recently that the corporation was considering such a move because of alleged attempts to transfer Sueno Kosan assets to affiliates.
In September, Sueno Kosan chief Kenichi Sueno pleaded guilty in the Osaka District Court to charges that he and some aides hid assets to prevent them being seized by creditors.
The Sueno group was the second-largest borrower from the mortgage firms.
Media reports have said it borrowed 236.7 billion yen ($2.07 billion) from five of the seven jusen and about 300 billion yen ($2.63 billion) from 10 other financial institutions.
Noboru Matsuda, governor of the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC), which supervises the loan-collecting body, said in a statement that DIC has no intention of seeking the bankruptcy of every borrower from the jusen firms.
But he said that taking such action would be inevitable for some ""malignant"" borrowers like Sueno which he said had repeatedly attempted to hide assets.
Sueno Kosan officials were not immediately able to comment.
Japan's financial industry has made progress in tackling the problem of bubble-era loans gone bad, but analysts say some smaller loan institutions heavily exposed to the real estate and construction industries remain vulnerable.
The collapse of a major financing company last month, Nichiei Finance Co Ltd, with huge debt liabilities also highlighted the continuing fallout from the bad loan problem. ($1=114 yen)

27,"Share trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange could more than triple to a billion shares a day, once deregulation is decided and implemented, a senior official of the Finance Ministry said.
Atsushi Nagano, director general of the ministry's securities bureau, said he is resolved to make Tokyo a more attractive place to do securities business.
""It is not just a dream to boost the volume on Tokyo's stock market to one billion shares if we make the Tokyo market more attractive,"" Nagano told Reuters in an interview.
Nagano declined to discuss details of possible changes in regulations, but financial industry sources said some of the measures on the agenda are: - deregulation of brokers' commissions on smaller lots, - further breaking down the wall separating banks and securities houses, - allowing sales of investment trusts at bank counters.
On Friday, turnover on the exchange's first section was about 381 million shares, compared with a scant 225 million on Thursday. Daily turnover has averaged 300 million to 400 million in the past two years.
Nagano, whose bureau is responsible for overseeing the nation's securities markets and industry, said the industry has no choice but to open up to all investors from around the world in line with global standards.
Now recovering a little from a slump in business after the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy of inflated stock and asset prices of the late 1980s, the securities industry has begun to consider its future, although it is still somewhat vulnerable, he said.
In the past when turnover on the stock market dwindled, the government had thought of remedies such as increasing public spending, but this would not work any more, he said.
Share trading on the exchange was worth $889 billion last year, while that in New York stood at $3.08 trillion, data from the Finance Ministry show.
Trading volume of Nikkei 225 index futures on the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) plunged to 7.22 million lots or contracts in 1995 compared with 21.64 million in 1991, while that on the Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SIMEX) surged to 3.16 million lots from only 361,000 in 1991.
Market sources said declining turnover of Nikkei 225 index futures was attributable to tougher trading rules the Finance Ministry imposed after the bubble burst in the early 1990s.
In June, an advisory panel to the Finance Minister, the Securities and Exchange Council, established a special committee to debate reform in the securities markets, the industry and securities policy management.
Nagano said he wanted the committee to discuss wide-ranging issues which have impeded development of Japan's securities markets. ""I believe there is a lot of room to expand for this (securities) industry. While investors and borrowers need each other, there are some obstacles to matching (the needs of the two sides).""
Nagano said he did not want the committee to go into individual measures hurriedly without deep discussions about the problems facing the markets and the industry.
""It may take one or two months from now before discussions of individual issues start,"" he added.
The committee is expected to make proposals next June.

27,"The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd (IBJ) is working on radical reforms of its corporate structure and staff policies to gear up for the approaching era of ""Big Bang"" deregulation, financial sources said on Wednesday.
The bank will announce the plan, which is being spearheaded by president Masao Nishimura, in the coming months, they said.
The move would be another sign of the drive among Japan's debt-burdened banking industry to boost efficiency ahead of the reforms, which aim to liberalise the financial markets by 2001.
Nishimura held a luncheon meeting with analysts last week and sent a strong signal that the bank would soon clarify its strategy for success in a competitive, deregulated environment after Big Bang, they said.
This could include performance-related pay and other mechanisms designed to reward expertise and initiative rather than seniority.
An IBJ spokesman confirmed that president Nishimura had the meeting with economists and analysts, but did not give further details.
IBJ is working on a programme which includes a change in its corporate structure and the introduction of pay based on individual merit, said the sources, who did not want to be identified.
In Japan, tinkering with personnel practices is widely considered taboo, particularly at big banks, which are generously staffed compared with their international counterparts.
IBJ is aiming to be an international investment bank offering a variety of products to corporate customers and also intends to use a financial holding company, they said.
Nishimura told the Nihon Keizai Shimbun recently that the bank was considering boosting efficiency by setting up a company with a bank, securities house and trust banking firm under its umbrella.
Japan is expected to lift a ban on establishing financial holding companies next year, they said.
Analysts said that under a holding company, barriers between banks, brokers and insurers could be broken down and major banks could streamline their financial groups and bail out weaker affiliates.
The sources said that a sense of crisis is needed at the management level of Japanese banks as the reforms aimed at deregulating Japanese financial markets by 2001 will expose banks to greater competition from both domestic and international rivals.
If IBJ were to announce a radical reform programme, it would probably be welcomed by investors, they said.
IBJ, the biggest of Japan's three long-term credit banks, provides long-term loans to big corporations by mainly obtaining funds through bank debenture issues, not deposits.
However, the businesses of long-term credit banks have been hurt by recent moves by corporate clients to raise funds through the securities market.
Worries about their business outlook have also increased as the proposed Big Bang deregulation will lift barriers between various financial sectors that have hitherto protected the banks' business territory, they said.
"
27,"The top executive of Japan's leading brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, resigned from his post on Friday to atone for a scandal over suspected illegal deals.
Nomura said president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down as of Friday and became an adviser to the company. Chairman Masashi Suzuki takes on the job of president in addition to the chairmanship.
""As the top official of the company, I think I should take responsibility,"" Sakamaki told a news conference.
The scandal broke last week when Nomura said two of its directors, who subsequently resigned, had made apparently illegal deals and funnelled funds to a corporate client linked by Japanese media to a former ""sokaiya"" racketeer.
The president's resignation, which was widely expected, comes amid signs that the scandal may be widening as suspicion falls on other prestigious Japanese brokerages.
Nomura's Sakamaki said the scandal was not endemic in the company itself, but added he did not know whether other Nomura executives were involved in the suspected illegal deals, which are being investigated by the nation's securities watchdog.
The brokerage pledged to strive to win back public trust.
""My first priority is to restore confidence,"" chairman Suzuki told the same news conference. ""We will take all possible measures to avoid any repetition of such scandals.""
Sokaiya, often linked to ""yakuza"" crime syndicates, typically try to extort money from firms by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called ""sokai"" in Japanese.
Companies have also been known to hire sokaiya to muzzle legitimate shareholders' questions at the annual meetings.
The case is another blot on the reputation of corporate Japan after a spate of scandals over unauthorised trading in financial markets, shady oil deals and overly cosy ties in the ""iron triangle"" of politics, business and bureaucracy.
Speculation is also spreading that similar scandals may emerge at other brokerages.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Friday that regulators will likely probe Japan's other ""Big Four"" brokerages after reports that the corporate client cited in the Nomura scandal as having sokaiya links also holds accounts at other leading securities houses.
""It's hard to believe the authorities will sit by after such reports. It's common sense for them to conduct an appropriate investigation,"" he said.
Nomura had been widely expected to make a top management sacrifice to express remorse over its second scandal in just six years. In 1991, senior Nomura executives Setsuya Tabuchi and Yoshihisa Tabuchi (no relation) resigned over revelations the brokerage had compensated favoured clients for losses and that affiliates had dealt with gangsters.
The fate of the two Tabuchis, who rejoined Nomura's board in 1995, was being watched by some analysts for clues to how serious the brokerage was about internal reform. Nomura said on Friday that the two will quit the board again.
The scandal is a potentially serious blow to Nomura's business as well as its reputation, as a number of financial firms, including one in the Nomura group, have suspended dealings with the brokerage pending the outcome of the probe by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC).
Nomura also faces a possible shareholder suit seeking compensation for any losses resulting from the scandal.
Leading credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said on Friday that short-term financial damage may be limited but Nomura faces the challenge of strengthening management control, restoring its reputation and regaining business momentum.
"
27,"Japan's big securities houses have come to accept that deregulating commissions on stock transactions is essential if they are to keep their major customers, industry sources say.
""Many Japanese brokers oppose liberalisation, but it is unavoidable if they want to keep the status of the Tokyo stock market from falling,"" one industry source said.
The sources cited an increase in ""black-eyed"" foreigners -- Japanese who buy Japanese stocks through brokers overseas to avoid higher commissions charged by domestic brokers.
However, the sources also said deregulation should be done gradually so as not to jeopardise small brokerages depending on commissions for most of their revenue.
""Big Four brokers will be able to withstand the impact of liberalisation, but smaller brokers will not,"" the source said.
Japan's ""Big Four"" -- Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities -- are preparing for the liberalisation of broking fees as they fear they will lose customers, who are becoming more aware that it is cheaper to place orders abroad for Japanese stocks than it is in Japan, the sources said.
Japanese brokers charge 535,000 yen ($4,908) for buying or selling a contract worth 500 million yen ($4.58 million), the sources said, while fees overseas would be less than half that.
The Big Four depended on commissions for about 30 percent of their revenue in the fiscal year to March 31, 1995.
But commissions accounted for more than 70 percent of revenues for many of Japan's 230 smaller brokerages, they said.
Earlier this year, the Pension Welfare Service Public Corp (Nenpuku), which manages about 23 trillion yen ($211 billion) in public pension funds, commissioned investment advisory companies to manage its funds.
""Those investment advisory companies set up so-called limited partnerships abroad and placed orders in London,"" said another industry source.
""By trading in the over-the-counter market in London, they saved money as stockbroking fees there are cheap and there is no securities transaction tax.""
This triggered interest from other institutional investors, the sources said.
While no statistics are available, purchases by the so-called black-eyed investors had recently inflated figures for purchases of Japanese stocks by foreigners, they said.
Atsushi Nagano, director-general of the Japanese Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau, told Reuters the ministry was aware of the situation.
""Watching such cases, I feel like there is something wrong in the Tokyo market,"" he said.
When Japan liberalised broking fees for contracts of more than 1 billion yen ($9.1 million) in April 1994, the Finance Ministry said it would consider deregulating fees on smaller lots of stocks after seeing the impact of that liberalisation.
Industry sources said further deregulation would be one of the main topics at a special committee of the Securities and Exchange Council -- an advisory panel to the Finance Minister -- which is supposed to present proposals on how to reform Tokyo's securities market next June.
The second source said that even though no time frame had been set for the complete liberalisation of commissions, abolishing the securities transaction tax would help boost the Tokyo exchange.
Japan lowered the tax to 0.21 percent of the value of a sale from 0.3 percent, except for sales by securities houses, on April 1.
Broking fees were liberalised in New York in 1975 and in London in 1986. ($1=109)

27,"Japan's financial industry suffered another blow Tuesday when a court was asked to start bankruptcy proceedings against a major realtor that has estimated liabilities of almost $5.5 billion.
But analysts said that while the collapse of Osaka-based Sueno Kosan could affect some individual financial institutions, it was unlikely to have any major negative impact on the overall financial industry.
The Housing Loan Administration Corp., or HLAC, a semi-governmental body set up to collect problem loans run up by seven failed mortgage companies, said it had asked the Osaka District Court to start bankruptcy proceedings against Sueno Kosan and two of its affiliates.
If Sueno Kosan, a privately held real estate company that borrowed heavily from the ""jusen"" mortgage firms, is declared bankrupt, it could become one of Japan's biggest-ever business failures, analysts said.
The HLAC said it has claims totalling 347 billion yen ($3.07 billion) on Sueno Kosan and the two units. The claims were transferred from the failed jusen firms to the body.
Sueno Kosan group's total liabilities are estimated at 620 billion yen ($5.48 billion), said Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co, a private credit research body.
Japan's banking industry was also jolted last month when a major financing company, Nichiei Finance Co. Ltd, filed for liquidation with huge debt liabilities. Like the jusen and Sueno Kosan, Nichiei was a casualty of the property-related lending boom in the late 1980s ""bubble era"" and the subsequent dive in asset prices.
Although the overall damage to the financial system may be slight, analysts said individual non-bank financial institutions with outstanding loans to Sueno could suffer. A non-bank financial institution makes loans but does not take deposits, raising funds by borrowing from banks.
""Should Sueno be forced into bankruptcy and its assets distributed, many of the other lender non-banks will be forced to absorb huge losses relative to their size,"" said James Fiorillo, ING Baring Securities (Japan) analyst.
""This will probably force many of them (creditors) into distress or bankruptcy, so the outcome ... should be closely watched,"" he said.
Finance Minister Wataru Kubo did not appear to be that worried, although he told reporters the Sueno Kosan problem might spread to financial firms that had lent it money.
""However, such an impact will be resolved among related financial institutions in accordance with our financial system,"" he said.
In June, Japan adopted a controversial plan that allowed for the use of 685 billion yen ($6.06 billion) in public funds to help wind up the jusen.
"
27,"A Japanese regional bank said on Wednesday that it could lose up to $26 million due to suspected misuse of bank funds by an employee.
Before Biwako Bank Ltd's announcement, rumours had swirled in Tokyo's markets that the bank was having financial problems, jolting stock and bond prices.
The bank allayed these fears somewhat when it said the suspected fund misappropriation, totalling about 3.4 billion yen ($29.8 million), would do only limited damage to its financial health.
However, analysts said the market jitters highlighted lingering nervousness about the health of Japan's financial industry, which is groaning under the weight of huge problem loans.
The bank said it expects to be able to recover about 400 million yen ($3.50 million) of the misappropriated funds and that it would write off the remaining expected losses in the current financial year ending next March.
The bank, based in Ohtsu City, western Japan, has yet to file a complaint against the former employee but plans to do so on completing an internal investigation, a bank official said.
Some analysts said the news about Biwako shocked markets because the bank had been considered financially healthy.
""The feeling of unease spread rapidly because it was talk about (financial) problems at a bank whose name had never been mentioned among the list of troubled banks before,"" said Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
""If the name was one included in the list, the impact would have been minimal,"" he said.
Fears about Biwako's financial health helped push down the Tokyo stock market's benchmark Nikkei average, which ended the morning session 1.20 percent lower than the previous day close.
The Nikkei ended the day down 276.41 points, or 1.32 percent, at 20,681.67.
The rumours pressured Biwako's share price, which had fallen to 491 yen by the midday close after closing at 549 yen on Monday. It was untraded on Tuesday and the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) suspended trading in it on Wednesday afternoon.
The drop in stock prices supported the Japanese government bond (JGB) market and the key December JGB futures contract rose to 125, a record high for any benchmark.
Analysts said the market was particularly nervous about talk about the health of a financial institution after Japanese financing company Nichiei Finance Co Ltd filed for liquidation last week with huge debt liabilities.
Japan's financial industry is still reeling in the aftermath of the late 1980s ""bubble economy"" of soaring stock and property prices.
When asset prices began to plunge in the early 1990s, many companies which had borrowed aggressively to invest during the bubble economy were unable to return the money and their lenders were left saddled with huge problem loans.
While big Japanese banks are expected to clean up their problem loan woes over the next one year or so, many others are likely to be plagued by the problem for longer period, said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.
However, failures of financial institutions would not jeopardise the system now that Japan had established a framework for handling such problems, he said.
"
27,"Sanwa Bank Ltd, one of Japan's top banks, intends to list its shares in New York as soon as possible in a bid to become a truly global player in the financial sector, its president said on Wednesday.
""We want to do so as early as possible.  We need to take various forward-looking measures including the listing (in New York),"" Naotaka Saeki told Reuters in an interview.
Sanwa Bank is one of Japan's six biggest commercial banks, with assets of 51.96 trillion yen at the end of last September.
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd is the only Japanese bank listed in New York.
Financial sources said that Sanwa could not be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, however, until it had recorded a profit for three consecutive years.
After posting a parent current loss of 259.87 billion yen in 1995/96 to write off massive problem loans, including loans to failed mortgage firms, or ""jusen"", Sanwa has forecast a parent current profit of 50 billion yen for 1996/97, which ended March 31.
In 1996/97 Sanwa is disposing of 450 billion yen in problem loans, which would cover 48 percent of its estimated problem loans as of the end of March. The bank is scheduled to announce its 1996/97 business results later this month.
Saeki said he would not, however, declare that the bank's problem-loan mess was behind it.
He added that while the bank has been preoccupied with the disposal of problem loans for the past few years, it will now aim to boost its return-on-equity (ROE) ratio, a gauge of the efficiency of the use of capital, to 12 percent.
It also aims to increase its international capital adequacy ratio to 10 percent from an estimated 9.0 percent at the end of March 1997, he said.
Saeki added that the possibility of a major Japanese bank failure has virtually disappeared, as Japan's big banks have largely completed preparations to meet the stiff requirements to be imposed under the nation's early warning system, scheduled for launch in April 1998.
He added, ""Land prices are thought to have bottomed out, so the environment has also changed.""
Asked if Sanwa is seeking a merger partner, Saeki stated that the bank had no such intentions.
""In the past, in regulated markets, our predecessors might have thought that bigger is better. But now, with deregulation, we have various options,"" he said.
Even if a big Japanese bank merged with another big one, it would have few advantages in Japan because it is difficult to cut payrolls given Japan's social conventions, he said.
Saeki added, however, that Sanwa may form alliances with foreign financial institutions in specialised areas such as overseas leveraged buy-outs and mergers and acquisitions.
He also said that Sanwa would seriously study the possibility of setting up a financial holding company following the expected lifting of Japan's ban on such companies as part of its deregulation drive.

33,"Investors in Britain's growing band of listed soccer clubs have recently experienced that sinking feeling all too familiar to long-suffering fans.
Shares prices have fallen faster than a relegation-bound team as the euphoria surrounding potential earnings from sources like pay-per-view television gives way to more sober analysis.
The sector has lost around 30 percent in the last six weeks or so, smaller clubs such as premier league strugglers Southampton and first division Sheffield United among the biggest losers.
However, even English champions Manchester United have seen their share price fall from a January high of 737p to its current level of 630p, this despite continuing success on the pitch at home and in Europe.
Share analysts who follow the financial fortunes of the clubs point out that these falls must be seen in the context of spectacular rises of 200 percent and more since early 1996.
Their view is that investors are backing a winner if they stick with the big clubs but that people should think twice before putting money into clubs outside of soccer's elite.
""We believe a derating of the smaller clubs is inevitable and could be marked. These are the footballing bubbles that will fade and die,"" UBS analysts Guy Feld and Julian Easthope wrote in a recent report on what they call ""UK Football Plc"".
""In England, Premier League status will be essential, and the cost of being outside it will increase, because of the increasing concentration of TV revenues at the top end of the game,"" they added.
Pay-per-view television is seen as a major benefit to only the creme de la creme of the British and European game.
UBS selected a top 10 UK soccer franchises, featuring listed clubs Manchester United, Leeds United, Glasgow Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur.
Two more of their tips, English premier league clubs Newcastle United and Aston Villa, will join the market shortly.
Analysts expect heavy interest in both those clubs, given their strong fan base and established position among the most successful teams in the country.
Analyst Nick Batram of Greig Middleton agrees that share prices of some of the smaller clubs could fall further.
But he believes that clubs can make money outside the premier league, providing they do not overstretch themselves.
""They have to look at being profitable in the lower divisions rather than gambling on getting in the Premier League,"" he said.
""Millwall is unfortunately a good example of what happens when you speculate on promotion,"" he said.
Second division Millwall were forced to call in the administrator in January after running up debts of 10 million pounds ($16 million).
The south London club had signed players on lucrative contracts in a bid to join the 20-club premier league elite but ran into financial problems when the club went down rather than up at the end of last season.

33,"United News &amp; Media on Tuesday secured victory in a battle for control of international exhibitions group Blenheim with an agreed offer valuing the company at 592.5 million pounds ($935 million).
The deal will create the world's largest trade exhibition group with a turnover of more than 500 million pounds, based on 1995 figures.
Media and financial services group United said it had already secured acceptances for 51 percent of Blenheim after offering five pounds per share.
""The acquisition will be earnings-enhancing in the first full year but the real attraction is the long-term growth we can get out by combining these businesses into one group,"" United chief executive Clive Hollick told Reuters.
United News shares added 31p to 674-1/2p after the announcement, while Blenheim gained 22-1/2p to 496p.
Dutch publisher VNU, which last week acquired a 15 percent stake in Blenheim, said it would not make a counter-bid and was likely to sell its stake. That decision effectively removed the threat of a bidding war developing for Blenheim.
Anglo-Dutch media group Reed-Elsevier had been regarded as a rival suitor to United but sources close to the company indicated in the last few days that it had dropped out of the running.
The deal ends an on-off saga that began in June when Blenheim said it had received a bid approach. In August it said that talks with an unnamed party had broken down but then made another statement a few weeks later confirming a new approach.
Based on 1995 figures, combined turnover and operating profit would be 545.5 million pounds and 88 million pounds, respectively.
Analysts said that Blenheim's geographical strength in continental Europe, and France in particular, made it a good fit with United.
United's Miller Freeman subsidiary operates more than 100 exhibitions in the U.S., Europe and Asia but the American market is seen as its main strength. These exhibitions are supported by a range of trade publications.
Blenheim operates more than 170 exhibitions worldwide but does not have a significant publishing portfolio.
""The directors of United believe that the Miller Freeman and Blenheim trade show portfolios are highly complementary geographically, by market sector, and in terms of operational management,"" United said in a statement.
The acquisition is the first major move by United since the national newspaper group merged with television and financial services group MAI earlier this year.
That merger doubled the size of the company, creating a British media major with a market capitalisation of more than three billion pounds. ($1=.6337 Pound)

33,"Premier League Sunderland, one of the great names in the history of English soccer, said on Thursday that they hoped to raise up to 12 million pounds ($20 million) through a flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
The north-east club, which won the league title for the sixth and last time in 1936, joins a growing number of clubs seeking to capitalise on the popularity of the national game.
Premier league rivals Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur have full stock market listings while clubs such as Chelsea trade on the secondary market.
Others are expected to follow suit as revenue from a television deal with satellite broadcaster BSkyB and higher crowds help to transform the sport's finances.
Sunderland said that the new funds would be used to add the finishing touches to a new 15 million pounds stadium, reduce borrowing and fund the purchase of new players.
""The proceeds will assist in retaining premier league status and enable the company to capitalise more fully upon the club's name, strong support and new opportunities arising from the move to the new stadium,"" chairman Bob Murray told a news conference.
Sunderland will leave their century-old Roker Park home at the end of the season and move to a 42,000-capacity stadium built on the site of a former colliery in the heart of the city.
The club, whose last real taste of glory came in 1973 when they won the F.A. Cup, are optimistic that the move to a new stadium will herald a period of prosperity on and off the pitch.
Sunderland were promoted to the premier league last season and forecast that increased gate receipts and television revenue would help double turnover this season to 13.6 million pounds.
Murray said that the new stadium should allow Sunderland to boost its season ticket holders from 17,000 to around 28,000. Roker Park is in a dilapidated state and large parts of the 22,000 capacity ground are vast terraces open to the elements.
Sunderland, managed by former England international Peter Reid, have only a modest playing squad without the star names of neighbours Middlesbrough and Newcastle United. They are fifth from bottom of the premier league and are likely to face a battle to avoid relegation this season.
The club conceded that staying in the premier league status was ""critical"" but said that it believed that increased income from the new stadium would offset lost television revenue if the team did go down.
Some 10 percent of the share issue will be made available to club employees and fans rather than institutional investors. The flotation is expected to value the club as a whole at 40-50 million pounds and share dealings will commence on December 24.
Chairman Murray and other leading shareholders, including manager Reid who has a six percent stake, have given undertakings not to dispose of any shares before early 1998.

33,"Britons will shortly learn how much they will be asked to pay to help fund the expansion of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio and television services in the multi-channel future.
The BBC has been lobbying the government to grant it an above-inflation increase in the annual licence fee, arguing that more money is needed if it is to remain at the forefront of broadcasting into the next millennium. The government is expected to announce its decision by early to mid-December.
The BBC, which calls itself ""the world's most successful cultural institution"", derives 95 percent of its funding from the annual fee payable by all television set owners.
The fee stands at 89.50 pounds ($150) and provided income of 1.8 billion pounds in the last financial year -- far outweighing the 77 million pound net benefit from the BBC's expanding commercial arm. The licence is guaranteed as a source of BBC funding for the next five years.
BBC Director-General John Birt launched his campaign for what he said would be the first real increase in the licence fee in over a decade at a conference in Edinburgh in August.
""If the BBC is to sustain the existing level of services; if it is to remain as creative and dynamic an institution in the 21st as it has been in the 20th century; if it is to innovate with high quality services in the new technologies...we shall need a real increase in the level of the licence fee,"" he said.
""Neither a new leap forward in efficiency, nor a vigorous drive to increase our commercial revenue will be enough.""
The BBC is believed to be seeking a rise of around five pounds -- which would generate extra revenue of more than 100 million pounds. Annual inflation is currently 2.7 percent.
Birt's call has received a cool reponse from the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour, wary of pinning a price rise on more than 20 million households in the run-up to a general election. The new rate would take effect in April while the election must be held by the following month.
Recent newspaper reports said that National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley has settled for a five-year formula that would leave the licence fee unchanged in real terms.
The reports said that Bottomley would offer higher rises in the second and third years to help fund new digital services and commercial projects but that increases in the following two years would be pegged below inflation.
The BBC, which runs two television channels and five national radio stations and has an enviable reputation as a quality public service broadcaster, has stepped up its campaign.
""You want us to do things. We want to do them. Now please give us the means and we can get on with the job,"" Will Wyatt, chief executive of the BBC Broadcast division said in a recent speech.
""We have called for only a modest increase, but one which would enable us to achieve a disproportionate amount of good.""
The BBC points out that it has cut its cost base by almost 20 percent over the past three years and increased programme investment by 300 million pounds.
The licence fee debate comes as the broadcasting industry is set to be revolutionised by the move to digital transmission.
Digital technology converts sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones. It increases picture quality, multiplies the number of channels that can be broadcast and allows for the creation of interactive services.
Pay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service with some 200 channels into Britain from next year.
BSkyB, one of the corporate success stories of the 1990s, is Britain's leading pay television operator with more than five million subscribers. Its top package of premium films and live sports events costs subscribers 324 pounds per annum.
A terrestrial digital service, broadcast from land-based transmitters and offering some 36 channels, is expected to begin by mid-1998.
The BBC plans to use digital technology to offer all licence payers supplementary programming to its core BBC1 and BBC2 output plus a 24-hour news service. It plans to make them available via satellite and terrestrial distribution.
The BBC expects to retain a share of around a third of all viewing and listening in 2005, down from 45 percent as the number of channels multiplies and the market fragments.
The digital expansion creates fresh opportunities for the corporation to develop its BBC Worldwide commercial arm.
Worldwide is in negotiations with partners in Britain and the United States over the creation of a number of subscription channels, exploiting its strengths in areas such as comedy, drama and natural history.
Its partner in Britain is Flextech Plc, while it is working with Discovery Communications Inc on channels for international markets. Leading U.S. cable television operator Tele-Communications Inc is a major shareholder in both companies. It aims to launch its UK services in mid 1997.
Some media figures doubt the sustainability of the licence fee as subscription and pay-per-view services proliferate.
David Elstein, chief executive of Britain's new Channel 5 commercial television network, said recently that he believed that pay-per-view would eventually ""consign the licence fee to history, where it belongs"". ($1=.5953 Pound)

33,"The battle for UK digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences is a David and Goliath contest pitting three of the country's biggest broadcasting groups against a little known cable company.
DTN, owned by Nasdaq-listed International CableTel, finds itself up against the might of pay television giant British Sky Broadcasting and ITV companies Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc.
But International CableTel chief executive Barclay Knapp has not yet raised the white flag as Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) considers the two bids.
""We are presenting ourselves as the ones that win on the merits,"" Knapp said in an interview on Wednesday.
""We are going to create an environment for new British programming to proliferate and to very aggressively exploit the interactive services component,"" he added.
Knapp believes that the successful launch of DTT is the best way to challenge BSkyB's dominance of UK pay television.
He also maintains that major programme makers and suppliers should not be left to run broadcast networks.
DTT signals are broadcast from land-based transmitters to ordinary aerials but viewers need a set-top box or decoder to view what is broadcast.
Digital compression improves sound and picture quality and means that more than 30 channels can be picked up. The technology permits a link to interactive services.
DTN and the rival British Digital Broadcasting consortium are each bidding for the same three blocks of frequencies, capable of carrying some 18 channels.
The ITC decision on the award of the licences is expected around May and DTT would begin in the spring or summer of 1998.
BSkyB plans separately to launch digital satellite services with up to 200 channels into the UK late this year and DTN questions its commitment to making the terrestrial version work.
International CableTel, the company behind DTN, has almost all its operations in the UK, where it is the third largest cable operator and also owns the NTL transmission network.
It believes its skills in programme packaging and marketing make it the ideal candidate to run DTT frequencies. Knapp points to International Cabletel's success in securing take up of around 40 percent in some of its cable franchise areas.
""Sports and movies are good for the first 20 percent in take-up but the two remaining factors are the breadth of choice and pricing,"" he said.
International CableTel breaks its programme packages down into tiers such as news or natural history to bring on board those not tempted by soccer or Hollywood blockbusters.
He believes that customers could be offered a limited package of say five extra DTT channels for around six pounds per month to get them to sample the multi-channel future.
""People don't want to dive right in, they just want to get their feet wet,"" he said.

33,"Shares in Pearson Plc slipped on Thursday as the stock market reacted negatively to the appointment of a relatively little-known insider as chief executive of the British media group.
Marjorie Scardino, currently chief executive of The Economist Group that is half owned by Pearson, will succeed Frank Barlow as chief executive at the end of the year.
Dennis Stevenson, who is a non-executive director, becomes deputy chairman now and will take over from Michael Blakenham as chairman at Pearson's annual meeting next May.
The appointment of Scardino ends a long period of uncertainty over the succession to Barlow, 66, who had said he planned to retire by early next year.
But the market greeted her appointment with scepticism, with market players saying they knew little about her. The shares fell to a low of 668 pence, but later recovered to 678 for a loss of 10 pence.
""The market was looking for a big hitter and she wasn't the big name it was looking for,"" one market-maker said in reference to Scardino.
The market was also worried by a report in the Independent newspaper that said Pearson had resolved concerns about the tax implications of selling its stake in British satellite broadcaster BSkyB but faced difficulties separating direct and indirect holdings.
The report said Pearson's indirect stake of around four percent was worth 440 million pounds ($697.4 million) at BSkyB's current share price.
Pearson, which has a market capitalisation of almost four billion pounds, is a sprawling media and leisure company with interests ranging from the Financial Times business newspaper to television soap opera.
Analysts have criticised the company for a lack of a clear strategy and it has long been seen as a potential bid target.
Scardino said she was excited to be joining Pearson.
""It is one of the few companies positioned strongly enough to take advantage of the opportunities in the rapidly changing, digital-driven international marketplace.""
Blakenham, who has been chairman of Pearson since 1983 following a six year stint as chief executive, said in statement the appointments completed the succession process at Pearson.
Barlow, who has been chief executive for seven years, had agreed to extend his contract for two years after his retirement date in 1995 in order to help implement the group's strategy to focus on the media sector.
""I think Pearson's future is very favourable and Marjorie Scardino is a very good appointment,"" he told Reuters.
Scardino, 49, has been chief executive of the Economist since 1992, before which she headed its North American operations.
Prior to that, she was partner in a Savannah, Georgia law firm and publisher and founder with her husband of a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper, the Georgia Gazette.
Stevenson is chairman of aircraft leasing group GPA and is also a non-executive director of British Sky Broadcasting, J. Rothschild Assurance Plc and Manpower Inc. ($1=.6309 Pound)

33,"The director-general of the BBC called on Friday for an increase in the British television licence fee to protect what he said was ""the most successful cultural institution in the world"".
Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, John Birt said the fee -- payable by all television set owners -- had fallen in real terms over the past decade and described the recent financial history of the BBC as ""miraculous"".
He said an increase was needed to help fund new services as digital technology multiplies the number of channels available.
""The BBC is the most successful cultural institution in the world, one of the great inventions of the 20th century. But it can no longer be taken for granted,"" Birt said.
""If it (the BBC) is to innovate with high-quality services in the new technologies as it has done again and again ... then at some point in the future -- and for the first time since 1985 -- we shall need a real increase in the licence fee.""
A colour television licence costs 89.50 pounds ($139.10) annually. Licence income totals around 1.8 billion pounds each year -- 95 percent of BBC income. The money funds the BBC's five national radio stations as well as its two television channels.
Sources at the BBC said it wanted a modest rise in ""low single (percentage) figures over time"". The BBC will shortly begin talks with the government to review the licence fee -- currently pegged to inflation.
Any price increase would take effect from April 1, 1997. A general election is due in Britain by next May and the government might be reluctant to saddle viewers with a higher licence fee shortly before it went to the polls.
Birt said the BBC was now towards the bottom of the European licence fee league table. He added that a top-rate subscription to satellite broadcaster BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay television, costs 300 pounds annually.
The BBC says it has achieved cost savings of 100 million pounds in each of the past three years and aims to build on its commercial success as Europe's biggest broadcasting exporter.
But Birt said more licence money was vital.
Digital technology -- which will allow the creation of hundreds of new channels and interactive services such as home shopping -- is set to reach Britain next year.
BSkyB is planning to launch digital satellite services in late 1997 and a terrestrial version is expected to follow within a further 12 months.
The BBC is planning to offer licence-fee payers supplementary programming and a 24-hour news service as it moves into the digital era.
""It (digital) will mean upholding our national role -- and opening new doors wherever we can for licence fee payers,"" Birt added.

33,"John Major's Conservatives can no longer rely on the loyal support of much of Britain's press to help deliver the votes needed to secure a fifth successive election victory, editors and political analysts say.
""It's the Sun wot won it,"" Rupert Murdoch's top-selling tabloid trumpeted after Major's ruling party defied the opinion polls and secured a slim 21-seat majority in 1992.
Traditionally pro-Conservative newspapers, some 70 percent of Britain's press, threw their full weight behind Major five years ago, rubbishing opposition leader Neil Kinnock at every turn and warning voters not to trust Labour's promises.
""If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights,"" was the Sun's election day message, illustrated with a front-page picture of the Labour leader's head framed in a lightbulb.
But media watchers believe that Major is unlikely to enjoy such unequivocal support against Labour's Tony Blair in an election which the prime minister announced on Monday would be held on May 1. Labour has a big lead in opinion polls.
""It won't be possible for the Sun to be as enthusiastic about Major and negative about Blair as they were about Major and Kinnock last time around,"" said Ian Hargreaves, former editor of the Independent newspaper.
""They have poured so much crap on Major's head that it wouldn't be possible to back him enthusiastically and retain credibility with their readers,"" added Hargreaves, who now edits the left-leaning New Statesman magazine.
Kinnock was portrayed as volatile and untrustworthy by much of the press in the last campaign. Blair is a media-savvy moderate who has taken his party to the centre ground since becoming leader in July 1994 and is a harder target to attack.
Major's battle to keep his party together over future relations with the European Union has reduced his standing among the pro-Conservative newspapers, many of which demandi a stronger anti-European line.
""It would be inconceivable and a mistake for the Sun not to deliver its vote but it might not be done with the rasping clarity we have come to know and love,"" Hargreaves added.
""I would expect the Sun to be pro-Tory but I think the tone may be that of a 'plague on both your houses'. I think that might be something you see in quite a bit of the press.""
POLITICAL BIAS
British newspapers wear their political sympathies on their sleeves, not only writing trenchant editorials but also slanting their news coverage in a way that amazes many foreign readers.
The support is important as newspaper circulation remains high in Britain. The combined circulation of the national dailies has been in gradual decline but still tops 14 million each day.
Among the mass-market tabloids, the Daily Mirror and its Scottish sister the Daily Record were alone in backing Labour in 1992. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both stuck to their customary pro-Conservative line, as of course did the Sun.
Among the broadsheet ""quality"" press, Murdoch's Times and Canadian Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph both backed the government while the Guardian supported Labour and the Independent lived up to its name by remaining broadly neutral.
Most surprising of all was an election day editorial in favour of Labour from the Financial Times, the daily staple of business people.
Blair understands the power of the press and provoked controversy in 1995 when he accepted an invitation to address a conference organised by Murdoch's News Corp in Australia, the media magnate's homeland.
The Labour leader has dined with several newspaper proprietors and editors who have reacted with warm words to Blair. But Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell still believes he is ""dealing with a press that basically wants to do us in if it can"".
MURDOCH'S INFLUENCE
Murdoch's influence over the British press is hard to overstate, his News International arm controlling around 35 percent of the market through its ownership of the Sun, the Times and Sunday titles News of the World and Sunday Times.
""Labour are haunted by the Sun 'light-bulb' front page and are determined to avoid a repetition of that,"" said Andrew Jaspan, former editor of Britain's Observer newspaper, commenting on Blair's efforts to build bridges with Murdoch.
There has been speculation that some of the News International stable may come out and back Blair.
Campbell says the Sun and the Daily Mail, often called the voice of Middle England, are the most important papers for his party but he is cautious about the chances of their endorsement. ""I don't think even the most zealous right-wingers in those papers want to get back to where they were with Neil Kinnock,"" he said.
""Having said that, I've always said that if we could actually win the endorsement of a paper whose endorsement we didn't have at the last election, that would be a huge bonus."" The mid-market Express, known as a ""Conservative party cheer leader"", is one possibility. United News &amp; Media, the paper's parent company, is now controlled by Labour supporting peer Lord Hollick, nicknamed ""The Red Baron"".
ABILITY OF MEDIA TO SWING VOTES IN DOUBT
Despite the anecdotal evidence and the Sun's claims, there is some doubt about the extent to which newspapers are able to affect voting patterns although opinion polls show readers of the Telegraph, Times and Sun are increasingly turning to Labour.
""It does look as if the tabloids are able to swing people and the Sun seems better at doing this than the Mirror,"" said Bill Miller, politics professor at Glasgow University.
""Mirror readers are more likely to be politically committed whereas the majority of Sun readers are not political animals and more open to influence,"" he said.
But Miller, who has studied the effects of newspapers on voting, said the importance of the press can be overstated.
He notes that the Sun, for example, sells only four million copies in a nation of 35 million voters.
""There is a net influence -- perhaps a swing of one percent which last time would have made the difference between Major's majority and a hung parliament.""
But he said that this was not enough to affect the 15 to 20 percentage point lead which Labour holds in most opinion polls.
""If you want to annoy an incoming government you must expect to bear the consequences. It may be that the classic Tory tabloids realise this is not the election for them,"" he said.

33,"Britons resigned to spending Easter at home in front of the television will at least have extra entertainment this year with the new Channel 5 station which goes on air on Sunday night.
The station is the first commercial terrestrial channel to launch in Britain since Channel 4 (C4) in 1982. But C4 has a remit to cater for minority tastes while Channel 5 will go head to head against the powerful ITV commercial network of regional broadcasters.
""Channel 5's audience will grow as ITV's declines,"" Dawn Airey, Channel 5 Director of Programmes, said last month. She promised ""intelligent, stylish and popular"" shows from a channel hoping to attract advertisers seeking to target young consumers.
Channel 5 is aiming to fill in the areas its terrestrial signal cannot reach by securing carriage agreements with BSkyB, and the cable companies.
Satellite and cable subscription channels have multiplied in Britain in recent years but only around 25 percent of households take them, limiting their appeal to advertisers.
Britons are television addicts, spending an average of almost four hours in front of the set every day. But will they find anything they want to watch on the new channel?
Operating on a limited budget, the station has set itself apparently modest initial viewing targets.
Its chief executive David Elstein, who was hired from pay television giant BSkyB, has said he believes the channel can win a five percent audience share by the end of the year. ITV, by contrast, has a share of around 35 percent.
However, Channel 5's core programme budget is only 110 million pounds ($175 million), against 600 million for ITV.
The licence-funded BBC, which supplies the other two ""free to air"" UK channels, spent a total of 1.1 billion pounds on its television operations in 1995/96.
Channel 5, owned by British media groups Pearson Plc, United News &amp; Media, European broadcaster CLT-Ufa and U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus, has already had its share of problems before going on air.
Its major headache was the need to retune millions of video recorders in homes up and down the nation to avoid interference from its signal. That exercise has cost an estimated 150 million pounds, three times the original forecasts.
Channel 5 delayed its start date from January after the allocation of an extra broadcast frequency increased the workload on its army of retuners.
Little more than 60 percent of Britons are likely to be able to receive the service when it goes on air on Sunday. But this figure should increase to around 85 percent of the population by the end of the year as the extra frequency comes into use.
However, as many as two million of the 18 million homes reached could require a new or upgraded television aerial in order to get a decent picture.
Channel 5 plans a daily soap at 6.30 p.m. and its main evening news will be at 8 p.m., to avoid competing with the bulletins on BBC 1 and ITV.
That early news bulletin clears the decks for a daily feature film in the 9 p.m. slot. Extra money has been added to the core programming budget to secure movie deals and films lined up include Speed, Mrs Doubtfire and Independence Day.
The channel has also secured the rights to the Poland-England World Cup soccer match on May 31.
The consensus in the industry is that Channel 5 is likely to establish itself once the teething troubles are overcome. Its prospects are enhanced by the fact that it is getting into the market before multi-channel digital TV becomes a reality.
""It has got a whole set of problems such as retuning and coverage and it is entering what is now a much more competitive market,"" said Kip Meek, of media and telecommunications industry advisers Spectrum Strategy Consultants.
""But it is a new terrestrial channel and as such it should be able to make money.""

33,"British leisure group Rank Group Plc said on Thursday that it planned to open a further 36 Hard Rock cafes internationally over the next three years.
The expansion programme for the themed diners will be launched in July and cafes will open at the rate of one a month until the year 2000, the company said.
Rank, which last year reunited the Hard Rock brand worldwide, said the outlook for its businesses was promising after a year in which an exceptional charge of 232 million pounds ($375 million) badly hit profits.
Profit before tax in 1996 fell to 65 million pounds from 515 million the year before. However, the 1995 figure was boosted by a 236 million pound exceptional gain.
Rank raised its net dividend by eight percent to 17 pence per share and said operating profit before exceptional items was 13 percent higher at 290 million pounds.
The company, which is in the process of a radical restructuring, said that it expected to create 3,000 jobs in Britain this year as it opened new pubs, cinemas, holiday and leisure centres and bingo clubs.
The news was welcomed by British National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley, who saw it as a further boost to the nation's thriving tourist industry.
""This is excellent news for Britain and underlines the tourism industry's role as one of our major job creators and wealth generators,"" she said.
Rank shares, which have underperformed the market by 20 percent over the past year, added 19.5p to 434.5p.
Share analysts said that the price had been bolstered by Rank's plans to ask its shareholders for permission to buy back up to 10 percent of the company's stock.
Chief executive Andrew Teare said that Rank was well set after a decision to focus on four divisions -- Hard Rock, Holidays, Leisure and Film and Entertainment Services.
""These changes, together with the benefits of our investment programme and the generally favourable economic climate, provide a promising outlook for Rank,"" Teare said.
Rank last year won outright control of the Hard Rock brand worldwide when it bought the cafes and brand rights owned by Peter Morton, one of the joint founders of the chain in 1971. Ownership of the brand had previously been split.
There are plans this year to launch a television series based on the brand and a new Hard Rock Records label has also been announced.
Teare said Rank planned to sell its film distribution unit, which has a catalogue of classic British films dating back to the 1950s as well as some more modern American movies.
Newspapers have speculated that the sale might raise up to 150 million pounds but Teare indicated he thought some of the figures in the press were on the high side.
The exceptional charges related mainly to a 148 million pound property value writedown, plus a loss on disposals and charge for restructuring.
Comparisons with last year were further complicated by a change in the way Rank accounts for its remaining 20 percent interest in Rank Xerox, its office equipment joint venture with America's Xerox Corp.
Rank repeated that it planned to sell the stake when a suitable opportunity arises. However, Teare told analysts that he had not yet discussed the sale with Xerox. ($1=.6184 Pound)

24,"Australia's largest banks and insurance groups, impatient to go on the merger and acquisition warpath, have had to sit on their expansion plans over the last year while they waited for the ""Wallis report"".
Now their wait is almost over.
The Financial System Inquiry set up in June last year by the then newly elected Liberal/National government and chaired by businessman Stan Wallis will release its report at noon (0200 GMT) on Wednesday.
Analysts expect Wallis will recommend an easing of current restrictions on mergers between Australia's six largest financial groups, unleashing acquisitive banks like National Australia Bank (NAB) to go hunting for the smaller majors like Westpac Banking Corp and ANZ Banking Group Ltd.
The waiting has already proved too much for one bank, which jumped the gun last week and announced it had agreed to take over another smaller regional bank.
Treasurer Peter Costello, who is releasing the Wallis report, pointedly said he would not approve Westpac's plan to take over Bank of Melbourne until he had considered Wallis' recommendations.
Wallis is also expected to ease rules governing foreign takeovers of Australia's largest banks and revolutionise its systems for prudential supervision.
""The expectation in the marketplace is that Wallis will lead to an easing of the rules on mergers -- that's the key issue,"" said Craig Drummond, head of research at one of Australia's largest brokers, J.B. Were.
Share prices of Australia's banks, and particularly those seen as most vulnerable to takeover, have rallied in recent months in expectation of an easing of the former Labor government's ""Six Pillars"" Policy.
Then Labor Treasurer Paul Keating instituted the ""Six Pillars"" policy in 1990 to stop mergers between any of Australia's big four banks, ANZ, Westpac, NAB and Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the two largest pension and life insurance groups, Australian Mutual Provident Society and National Mutual.
Wallis said in November his inquiry would look at recommending ""Six Pillars"" be scrapped, leaving any judgement on a bank or life group merger to the anti-monopolies regulator, the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC).
Those arguing for an end to ""Six Pillars"", including NAB, have said global competition and new technology like Internet banking meant big bank mergers would not reduce competition.
Wallis is also widely expected to cut back the number of regulators which currently monitor the prudential health of banks, credit union, insurance groups and superannuation funds.
Wallis may even remove the Reserve Bank of Australia's powers as the prudential supervisor to banks, leaving it to concentrate on operating monetary policy.
One other option being considered that could transform the big banks' share registers is a relaxation of laws which currently stop industrial companies and other non-banks from owning more than 10 percent of a bank.
The rule is supposed to stop a bank being weakened by one of its owners, if perhaps a more risky company went bankrupt.
Wallis has said he wants to foster competition and lower the barriers to ownership and participation in the banking system, possibly allowing telecommunciations groups and others to buy into banks or operate their own banks on the Internet.

24,"News Corp Ltd chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch, visiting Australia for News' annual meeting next week, says his global media group remains on track to boost profits by 20 percent in 1996/97.
Murdoch, in a newspaper interview published on Friday, also ruled out any potential News Corp bid for Australian newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd and said Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd had repeatedly tried to sell its 15 percent Fairfax stake in the last year.
News Corp owns about five percent of Fairfax.  
Rejoining his recent feud with CNN owner Ted Turner and Time Warner, Murdoch also said he was confident his law suit against the two would succeed.
Turner said on Thursday that Murdoch's lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting System Inc and Time Warner was a ""frivolous piece of junk.""
Murdoch said he was confident he would win the legal action launched last week to block the Turner merger with Time Warner.
""We've got a good stoush (fight) there,"" Murdoch said.
""We'll win through there. How or where I don't know but we'll just keep the pressure on,"" he said.  
Murdoch repeated News' bullish outlook for profits.
""If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly (the 20 percent rise is attainable),"" he told News Corp's Courier Mail newspaper in Brisbane.
""But it is still early days to be saying that,"" the newspaper quoted Murdoch as saying.
News Corp said after its 1995/96 results in late August that a 20 percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was very attainable. News posted a A$1.02 billion net profit in 1995/96.  
Murdoch then said the government's investigation of the current cross-media rules, which stop the dual ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same city, would benefit Packer. Murdoch predicted the cross-media restrictions would be removed, but that foreign ownership rules would stay.
""So it will leave things open for him (Packer) and not for us,"" Murdoch said.
The rules currently stop Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd from increasing its 15 percent holding in Fairfax while it owns the top-rating Nine Network.  
They also stop Murdoch's News from increasing its 15 percent stake in the Seven Network Ltd while it owns News Ltd newspaper publishing change. Foreign ownership rules stop News from increasing its five percent stake in Fairfax.
Asked what he expected to emerge from the government's investigation into the cross-media rules, Murdoch said: ""I think whatever Mr Packer wants. He seems to have very close influence with certain ministers in this government.""
Murdoch would not name the ministers.
However Packer was unlikely to push for a higher Fairfax stake at the moment, Murdoch said.  
""I don't want to buy Fairfax. I don't believe Mr (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax,"" he said.
""To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He'd like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he's too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today's price.""
Fairfax is 25 percent owned by Conrad Black's Hollinger International Inc, which is majority owned by Hollinger Inc.  
Murdoch also criticised the conservative government of Australian prime minister John Howard for not implementing decisive changes to boost the economy.
""If you're going to make radical changes, you'd better make them in the first year,"" Murdoch said of the government, which defeated the Labor government in the election on March 2.
""I think they've been slow to do that and not appearing as radical a government as I would have hoped,"" he said.

24,"HSBC Holdings Plc, Citicorp and Standard Chartered Plc are seen as the hungriest of the predators eyeing Australia's major banks now a ban on takeovers by foreigners has been lifted, analysts said on Thursday.
Treasurer Peter Costello announced on Wednesday the end of a former Labor government's blanket-ban on takeovers of Australia's four largest banks by foreigners.  
The weakest of the four majors, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Westpac Banking Corp, are considered the juiciest prey for the foreign banks.
""HSBC is regarded is as perhaps the number one predator,"" said ABN AMRO banking analyst Mike Pulman.
""After that Lloyds TSB or ABN AMRO or Citicorp or Deutche Bank are the most likely,"" Pulman said.
However analysts said HSBC was unlikely to be closely eyeing ANZ because of ANZ's strong presence in Asia through its Grindlays unit, which would simply create duplication.  
National Australia Bank Ltd, the strongest of the big four, is seen as the least likely of the takeover targets because of its hefty overseas assets and its sheer size.
""They (NAB) don't provide purely an Australian exposure and they carry some foreign assets which might not be attractive to a bidder, particularly if you're already in that market,"" said Shaw Stockbroking banking analyst Anusha Srinivasan.
NAB owns Britain's Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank, the National Irish Bank and Michigan National Corp.  
""ANZ carries with it the same sort of caveat, do you want exposure to this Asian distribution they've got?"" Srinivasan said.
""ANZ argues it would be the least attractive to HSBC because of its Asian operations and the duplication aspect,"" Pulman said.
However, other analysts said ANZ's Asian connection may prove an attraction rather than a deterrent to those European and U.S. banks that don't have an Asian presence.  
Westpac, which does not have the same overseas assets, is therefore seen as the most likely of the weaker two banks to be taken over by a foreign bank. It is also seen most willing.
""Westpac is possibly the most likely, more because of the attitude of Westpac management which might be the most receptive to a bid,"" Pulman said.
Westpac's chief executive Bob Joss is an American seen more focused on maximising value for shareholders than keeping the bank Australian-owned.  
Standard Chartered Plc is seen first in line for Westpac, having already formed an alliance with Westpac to provide banking services to Westpac customers in Asia.
The recently privatised Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the final member of the big four, is the dark horse in the race, analysts said.
CBA is heavily exposed to the ultra-competitive home loan market, making it attractive to some who want a strong home loan book, but tarnishing it for others more interested in higher margin activities.  
But any budding foreign acquirer will have to move fast because the first takeover of a four major banks may well be the last to get through before the doors are slammed shut again, the analysts said.
Costello's announcement on the end to the foreign takeover ban went with the caveat that any large scale transfer of bank ownership to foreigners would not be allowed.
Costello did not say how many bank takeovers would be too many, but the official Wallis Financial Inquiry has said any more than one takeover would be a problem.  
""If that is correct, whoever makes their move from offshore is going to have to do it pretty smartly,"" Srinivasan said.
""If a takeover bid for one of the majors by a foreign bank is successful, then consequent bids might not be,"" she said.

24,"Australia's largest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, forecast a rejuvenation in its profit outlook at its annual meeting on Tuesday but failed to stop shareholders launching into a six-hour tirade aimed at Coles' directors.
The prime target was former executive chairman Solomon Lew, who was re-elected as a director with the help of proxy votes after the floor of the meeting overwhelmingly rejected his re-election. Coles Chairman Nobby Clark, who was jeered when he tried to cut short debate on Lew's re-election, said Coles was seeing something of a rejuvenation in its businesses.  
""We're on the edge of something pretty good,"" Clark told the annual meeting. ""We do have an upside and I'm confident we can do better for you,"" he said.

24,"Almost 300 students and workers from the islands of Kiribati were adrift in the central Pacific on Wednesday aboard a crowded charter ship crippled by a fire, officials said.
The 1,000-tonne MV Maasmond appealed for help on Tuesday night after losing power through the fire in the engine room.
It was found by a Royal New Zealand Airforce Orion rescue plane drifting about 800 kms (500 miles) east of the Kiribati island of Tarawa with 290 passengers on board.
""The Orion located it this afternoon and was told via radio that it's in no immediate distress and has enough food and water for five days,"" Airforce Squadron Leader Ron Irons told Reuters from the RNZAF's base in Nandi, Fiji.
""It has partially restored its electric power, but it has no wasy to start its engine,"" Irons said.
An electrical fire in a switchboard in the engine room shut down the ship's electrical systems late on Tuesday, leaving the converted freighter without power and still two days sailing from the nearest land.
The ship's charterer, Kiribati businessman Waysang Kumkee, said the MV Maasmond's insurers would pay for another ship to tow it back to Tarawa.
The 64.5-metre (210 foot) Maasmond was chartered to carry 290 passengers, mostly Kiribati students and workers, and 400 tonnes of cargo to Christmas Island from Tarawa, Kumkee said.
A tugboat was likely to take two days to reach the stricken ship and another two days to tow it back to Tarawa, he said, adding the passengers had plenty of food and water to last the four days.
""It's not a problem. If they run out they can easily borrow some of the cargo,"" Kumkee told Reuters by telephone from Tarawa, one of a group of coral atolls about 5,000 kms (3,000 miles) north-east of Sydney.
The cargo included rice and tinned food.
None of the passengers or crew had been injured in the fire and the only problem on board was likely to be boredom given the ship's video players were out of action. ""With no videos, they'll be a bit bored,"" Kumkee said.
Most of the passengers were sitting or sleeping under canvas on blankets on the deck, he said.
They would be reduced to playing cards and their guitars until their rescue, he added.
The MV Maasmond is registered in Kingstown in St Vincent and Grenadines, according to the Lloyds List, and has had engine trouble in the past.
In 1992, it underwent engine repairs for ten weeks after encountering cyclones on a cruise through the Pacific.

24,"Australian-based metals recycler Simsmetal Ltd on Friday painted a bleak picture for world scrap metal prices over the year ahead and said this meant the group's net profit for 1996/97 would be lower than in 1995/96.
But it said it remained confident it could take advantage of a recovery in world markets when it came and was currently in talks to buy a large British scrap metal business.
Simsmetal managing director John Crabb told the annual meeting that scrap prices had softened dramatically to their lowest levels in almost four years over the last two months.  
""Until there is an improvement in the major economies of Europe and Asia and the resulting increase in demand for metals, we expect trading conditions to remain very difficult with volumes, margins and earnings below our expectations,"" Crabb said.
He later told reporters profits for the year to June 30, 1997 would be below the A$46.7 million posted in 1995/96 -- a result that was itself 23 percent down on a year ago.
""It will be lower for the full year,"" Crabb said.  
Simsmetal had previously only said it saw difficult conditions prevalent in the first quarter of 1996/97 continuing into the second quarter, with second quarter profits falling.
In mid-October, Simsmetal announced its net profit for the first quarter of 1996/97 fell 34 percent to A$8.28 million.
Crabb said the world construction markets which used the long steel produced by electric furnaces supplied by Simsmetal remained weak and had no immediate prospect of improvement.
""Our view is that we should start to see some improvement (in ferrous metals prices) towards the end of calendar 1997, we may see it in the middle (of calendar 1997),"" he said.  
""We can't see too much on the horizon at this time,"" he said.
Crabb also said Simsmetal was in talks to buy a large British business in the same area as Simsmetal, but he said he could not give any more details as he was bound by confidentiality agreements.
""It's in the U.K. For us it will be quite large,"" he said.
""We still need to balance our portfolio there, so that we've got a good broad coverage,"" he said.
""We'll use either some cash or our unusued borrowing lines. We've got no problems funding it.""  
He said Simsmetal had ended the first quarter with about A$62 million cash on hand.
""I guess we'd only be using 55-60 percent of our borrowing capacity at the moment.""
Simsmetal had total non-current borrowings of A$54.11 million as at June 30, 1996, giving a total warchest for possible acquisitions of about A$115 million.
Earlier in the annual meeting, Crabb said that any closure of the Broken Hill Pty Co Pty Ltd's Newcastle steel plant would not affect Simsmetals operations.  
Crabb said Simsmetal supplies most of its products to BHP's Sydney mini-mill and its Port Kembla plant, south of Sydney.
""Maybe it will make life easier for us because we will be able to buy more scrap,"" Crabb said, responding to a shareholders question.
Simsmetal's shares were up one cent at A$6.89 at 2.40 p.m. (0340 GMT).

24,"Westpac Banking Corp Ltd is expected to report on Tuesday that its net profit growth was reined back to a slower 10 percent in the 1995/96 year by an increasingly competitive home loan sector and a slower economy.
Analysts said the main focus in the results would be on how that increased competition and recent sharp cuts in home lending margins would hit Westpac's profits in 1996/97.
""You're really only going to have a full impact for the year ending September 1997,"" Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson said of the sliding home loan margins.  
""There'll start to be a moderating influence (on profits) which intensifies throughout 1997,"" he said.
""You'll see fairly cautious statements being made at the briefing.""
The median forecast in BZW's BARCEPs analyst survey is for a net profit before abnormals for the year to September 30, 1996 of A$1.12 billion, up about 10 percent from A$1.02 billion in 1994/95.
This compares with a 44 percent rise between 1993/94 and 1994/95.

24,"An official inquiry into Australia's financial system said on Thursday it would look at recommending a relaxation of rules that currently stop big bank mergers and takeovers by foreign banks.
The inquiry, which was established by the conservative government after its March election, outlined various options for reform in a wide-ranging discussion paper and was careful not to state its own preferences.  
But it noted majority industry support for abolishing the rules stopping mergers and foreign bank takeovers and said it preferred an anti-monopolies system which treated the banking sector the same way as every other sector.
Until now the government has had the final say on bank mergers, rather than just the anti-monopolies watchdog.
Analysts said the tone of the discussion paper reinforced widespread expectations that the inquiry's final report would recommend allowing bank mergers and new foreign investment.  
""It hasn't changed perceptions that ultimately the inquiry will make recommendations that allow the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) to permit bank mergers which haven't been permitted before,"" said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett Banking analyst Michael Pulman.
Shares in the big banks seen vulnerable to takeover have rallied since the beginning of the year in expectation that a conservative government would allow the mergers.
Possible takeover targets include the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and Westpac Banking Corp.  
The National Australia Bank Ltd, Australia's largest and most profitable bank, is seen as the main predator.
A policy set by the former Labor government and known as the 'six pillars' policy has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia's four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups.
The conservative coalition government has said this policy would remain in place until it has considered the Wallis inquiry's recommendations, due to be delivered by the end of March 1997.  
The inquiry, headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, said in its 415 page paper any reforms should increase the efficiency of Australia's banks to compete globally.
It also said new technology would transform the sector.
Big banks such as the National Australia Bank have used the same reasoning when lobbying for relaxed merger rules.
These banks have said big bank mergers are necessary to compete globally and new technology such as the Internet and global competition meant such mergers would not cut competition.  
""The Inquiry sees as its key goal the identification of means to increase the efficiency of the Australian financial system, without compromising its safety and peformance,"" the paper said.
Increased efficiency was needed to complete globally, to obtain the benefits of new technology and to increase investment returns, the paper said.
It said it would consider, ""better accommodating financial conglomerates,"" and, ""relaxing some of the ownership restrictions on financial institutuions"".  
The inquiry said it was also wanted any reforms to increase competition and asked in that context ""whether there are any public policy grounds for restrictions on foreign acquisitions in the banking or insurance industries?""

24,"Global media group News Corp Ltd told analysts in a telephone briefing on Thursday that it still expected 20 percent profit growth for the 1996/97 year, despite a below-expectations first half profit result, analysts said.
""They did say that they're still on track for the 20 percent growth,"" one senior Sydney media analyst said after the morning teleconference briefing between company officials and U.S. and Australian analysts.  
Another senior media analyst, who also asked not to be named, said News had repeated its August 1996 forecast of 20 percent profit growth in the teleconference.
""Yes. They've got no worries about reaching that one,"" the analyst said.
Earlier on Thursday, News Corp posted a A$731 million net profit before abnormals for the six months to December 31, up 10.3 percent on the same period a year earlier.
But this was below analysts expectations of a pre-abnormals net profit for the half of A$735 million to A$775 million.

24,"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is likely to benefit from the planned US$20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc , Australian media analysts said on Monday.
They said News, which already has a wide-ranging partnership with MCI, would strengthen its global media interests on the coat-tails of the creation of the world's second largest telecommunications group.
""It means they'll be in bed with a bigger more powerful global telephony group,"" one senior Sydney media analyst said.  
Analysts also said the BT-MCI merger would stabilise New Corp's partnership with MCI, which had seemed increasingly strained in recent months. ""It seems that MCI and News haven't been getting on lately, whereas News and BT have been getting on a lot better,"" said the senior Sydney analyst.
The prospect of MCI selling its nine percent stake in News Corp over the next year had suppressed News Corp's shares in the last month. ""There was a view that MCI wasn't real happy with it (the partership) and may sell out, but now nothing's going to happen for 12 months at least,"" said another Sydney analyst.  
""The implications for News are quite positive,"" the analyst said.
A Melbourne analyst said some in the market were a bit worried that MCI was preparing to  to sell down their stake over the next 12 months. ""The fact that BT may combine with MCI reduces that risk for now at least,"" the analyst said.
MCI and News Corp announced a broad alliance in May 1995, under which MCI bought a nine percent stake in News for US$1.35 billion and acquired an option to increase that stake up to 13.5 percent. They agreed, amoug other things, to jointly set up an American satelite television operation -- ASkyB.  
But progress with ASkyB has been slow and other smaller joint ventures have failed to fire.
However, the Australian analysts said they would remain somewhat cautious given bearish comments on Sunday by MCI.
MCI announced that it would cut its stake in ASkyB to 20 percent from 50 percent.
Analysts said this was not surprising as News Corp and MCI had said recently they wanted new partners in the venture.  
But MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts also told Reuters on Sunday that no major new launches were expected from the venture with News Corp and that MCI would sell to News a US$700 million satellite license if it could.
He also said MCI was unlikely to take up its option to increase its stake in News, a comment seen by analysts as symptomatic of Roberts' increasing unhappiness with the deal.
Analysts also said there was the potential for a regulatory block to links between News, its 40 percent owned BSkyB Plc and BT.  
""There's an outside risk that British regulatory bodies could try and block the News-BSkyB-BT side of it,"" said another BT analyst.
Other analysts said the dilution involved, with BT owning nine percent of a 40 percent stake in BSkyB, would assuage regulatory concerns. The likely election of a British Labour government also reduced that risk.
""They're banking on (Labour leader) Tony Blair winning government and deregulating cross media rules in the United Kingdom,"" said another Sydney analyst.  
However another analyst pointed to the recent banning by British regulator Oftel of a joint marketing campaign between BT and BSkyB as a sign of the rocky road ahead for News and BT.

22,"China issued another strong signal on Sunday that its stock and bond markets have been given the green light for fast growth to provide the economy with more efficient means of investment.
The official Shanghai Securities News said the stock and bond markets must be developed vigorously to provide a stronger foundation for national economic development.
The newspaper quoted a report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a think-tank, as saying the efficiency of investment channels was a key question affecting the long-term development of China's economy.
""The sluggish development of the direct investment markets is one of the factors affecting the long-term development of the national economy, so it is necessary to speed up the development of stocks, bonds and other direct investment markets,"" it said.
The report was the latest in a series of indications that Beijing's previous suspicion of the securities markets has been replaced by a determination to expand and strengthen them.
It said more direct investment would help to reduce the tangle of problems surrounding heavily indebted state enterprises and the state banks that are currently forced to support the enterprises with a constant supply of loans.
""Banks are being squeezed from both sides, given the high risk (of loans to state enterprises) and the ever-growing deposits they are taking in,"" the paper said.
It said that it would be better for all parties if depositors put less cash into bank deposits and invested it directly in companies through the securities markets.
""Most of the money in the hands of ordinary people is currently put into bank accounts, which increases total bank deposits even as enterprises are short of money, resulting in capital being left idle and wasted,"" the report said.
The current small scale of the direct investment markets was a key reason for this imbalance, it said.
""So how to standardise, develop and strengthen the direct investment markets to allow for more reasonable usage of deposits is an important part of raising the efficiency of banks and making more efficient use of capital,"" it added.
The report gave no details on shifting the focus of enterprise investment from banks loans to securities, but Beijing has implemented a number of measures recently aimed at expanding the securities markets.
A record number of companies have this year been given approval to list shares on the country's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
The Shenzhen market was strongly affected last week by rumours, denied in Beijing, that securities authorities were about to release the quotas for company listings for next year.
But authorities last week did announce a major relaxation of policy on mutual funds, which are seen as an important conduit for funnelling funds from ordinary people into the securities markets.
Regulations allowing existing mutual funds to list on the stock exchanges are due to be released before the end of the year, official media reports said.

22,"China is planning major reforms of its government debt markets in 1997 to make them more responsive to market forces and their rates more flexible, officials and analysts said on Tuesday.
Reforms this year will focus on creating a more market-driven secondary market after a series of measures taken last year to improve the primary market, including the introduction of a public tender for setting coupons, they said.
In a speech on this year's plans for state debt markets, a senior official said reforms in 1997 will aim to improve coordination between the primary and secondary markets, the Shanghai Securities News said on Tuesday.
""We will actively strengthen the role of underwriters as market makers on the secondary market to promote the coordinated development of the primary and secondary markets,"" Deputy Finance Minister Liu Jibin was quoted as saying. Market makers -- major brokerages or securities houses -- would be required to invest consistently in the state debt market and help to stabilise prices when they fluctuate sharply, industry analysts said.
""A market maker system and off-floor trading will be introduced in 1997,"" the newspaper on Monday quoted Gao Jian, director of the ministry's state debt department, as saying.
China began state debt issues in the early 1980s with purchases made compulsory for many people such as government employees and staff of state-run enterprises.
By the early 1990s, purchases of government debt were voluntary, but state-run banks were still forced to underwrite whatever amount they were allocated by the authorities.
Real market forces did not come into play until 1995 when Beijing for the first time used a public tender system to set the coupon rate on a debt issue.
The system was used for all issues in 1996 -- an indication the primary market has been largely freed from administrative control, traders said.
""With the changes to the primary market now in place, reforms this year are expected to give more priority to the secondary market,"" said Lu Weiming, a state debt trader with China Guotai Securities.
""They are looking at reforms to the secondary market now largely because of the increasingly active trading there after three successive years of record debt issues,"" said a second trader.
China issued a record 195.2 billion ($23.52 billion) yuan worth of state debt last year and industry sources expect this year's issues to hit another record of 250 billion yuan.
In other reforms, the People's Bank of China at a meeting in Beijing last week ordered commercial banks to withdraw from trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets, traders said.
The banks, which have accounted for more than 80 percent of the money supply on the repurchase market alone, have been ordered not to build any new positions and to gradually offset their existing positions.
""The state debt market will gradually move to being dominated by securities brokerages as a result of the withdrawal of the commercial banks,"" said a trader with J &amp; A Securities.
Other significant changes will include more issues of treasury notes and bonds which pay interest on an annual basis instead of on maturity, officials have said.
The introduction of state debt paying annual interest will allow Beijing to one day open trading on the annual interest rate to pave the way for a possible start of financial derivatives, industry analysts said.
China issued two experimental batches of state debt paying annual interest in 1996.

22,"China's financial markets have made significant steps towards maturity in 1996, with Beijing more willing than ever to allow them to gradually take on the mantle of economic control, analysts said on Friday.
But the Chinese securities, futures and money markets, less than six years old and still suffering the volatility of youth, have a long way to go to reach the level of standardisation and stability found in many other Asian countries, they said.
""In the past the central government always used the word 'experimental' when referring to the markets, but this year they instead started saying they are 'in the initial stages of development',"" said a Chinese brokerage analyst.
""This shows that it is more determined than ever before to let the markets survive and develop,"" he said.
Beijing gave its official blessing to the stock markets in April, and since then, the exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen have expanded faster than ever before, adding a total of 178 companies between them so far this year.
Total market capitalisation of the two markets is now 1,271 billion yuan ($153 billion) compared with 350 billion yuan at the start of the year.
The treasury bill market also boomed in 1996 with a record issue of 195.2 billion yuan worth of debt.
An interbank market for local currency, set up in January, has become an indispensible mechanism for banks to swap short-term funds, and has started the process of making interest rates responsive to market forces.
The developments all take China significantly further along the road from the state-planned past towards the market-influenced future.
Analysts said that while the Beijing leadership remains highly cautious about relaxing its controls over the main economic levers, it understands that it must do so eventually.
""The key motive behind the new approach is to gradually relieve the central government of the heavy burden of (the) money-losing state sector,"" said one economist.
""Beijing has urged state enterprises to resort more to market means to develop themselves instead of relying on loans from the state banks.""
But this year, the authorities have also made it very plain that they will not allow rampant irregularities in the markets.
China's futures exchanges, which have largely operated as speculative casinos for years, have been firmly brought to heel over the past year.
The ""hot money"" which until early this year used to shift at lightning speed from Beijing green beans to Hainan plywood and on to Tianjin red beans has been squeezed out of the futures exchanges and shifted into the share markets, analysts said.
In the past month, branches of virtually all of China's top banks, securities houses and financial institutions have also been publicly accused of running illegal securities scams of one kind or another, with fines and warnings liberally dispensed.
""Serious efforts have been made to standardise the market,"" said a treasury bond trader. ""No one, even the influential banks and key securities houses, are exempt from punishment if they breach the rules.""
Analysts said the main shortcoming at the moment is the legal framework for the markets, which consists of a series of overlapping and often contradictory regulations.
The overall Securities Law and Futures Law, which will provide the basis for the future development of the markets, has been trapped in Beijing's bureaucracy for more than three years now with no sign of emerging soon, they said. ($1= 8.3 yuan)

22,"China's central bank wants to boost open market operations in 1997, partly to soak up state bank funds banned from the state debt repurchase and spot public secondary market, bankers and analysts said on Friday.
But the People's Bank of China seems to have not yet made up its mind on how to do it, the key problem being the central bank's shortage of the short-term treasury bills used in the open market operations.
Under new rules, state banks are banned from the repo and public T-bill spot markets and are allowed to buy T-bills only on the primary market. They can sell them only to the central bank, which at the moment is not buying, bankers said.
They said the lack of liquidity would make it difficult for the market to absorb the state bank funds gradually being withdrawn from the secondary markets.
""By promising more activity in the open market operations, the central bank wants to offset part of the impact of the ban,"" said a state debt analyst with a Chinese brokerage. ""But the central bank will have some difficulty keeping its promise.""
The central bank kicked off open market operations on a trial basis in April last year, trading short-term T-bills of one year and less with 14 state banks to give an indication of the bank's policies and to help to control money supply.
But accumulated turnover so far has only marginally topped four billion yuan ($482 million), too small to give any clear clues to the state of China's money markets, analysts said.
""We expect turnover of the open market operations to be significantly increased this year,"" a central banker said on Friday but declined to give any details.
Last week, deputy governor Chen Yaoxian was quoted by the official media as saying Beijing intended to make the open market operations one of the major means of controlling China's money supply this year. He did not give any details either.
""The central bank is surely feeling the urgent need to expand the open operations now that it has banned state banks from trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets,"" said one banker with the Bank of China.
""All major state banks have stopped trading on the markets,"" she added. ""But we have a lot of state debt in hand and the central bank must know we need to quickly find an outlet to prevent losses. We can't leave large sums just sitting there.""
The central bank at a meeting last week told state banks to withdraw from the markets, offsetting existing positions gradually. The aim is to stop bank funds from leaking into the volatile stock markets, traders said.
""One key problem is that the central bank has not bought any state debt on the primary market,"" said the state debt analyst with a Chinese brokerage. ""It has little state debt on hand to trade significant amounts of T-bills with the state banks.""
""Trading in the open market operations so far has been unilateral with the central bank only buying state debt,"" said a banker with a major state bank. ""Real open operations require the central bank to have a supply of state debt first.""
Another difficulty is how to ensure the state banks make as much from the operations as they have off the state debt secondary markets, analysts said.
""We have made good returns on the state debt secondary markets,"" said the banker from the Bank of China. ""We cannot expect the same returns in the open market operations, which will hurt our enthusiasm in trading with the central bank.""
Currently, the open market operations involve the central bank buying a total of 40 to 50 million yuan in state debt once a week from the 14 designated banks, bankers said.
That is a minuscule amount compared to the billions of yuan worth of state debt the state banks are used to trading each week on the state debt secondary markets in a week, they said.

22,"The threat of a Sino-U.S. textiles trade war is having little impact on Chinese firms as it is unlikely to go beyond words and because the companies are performing poorly, company officials and brokers said on Wednesday.
Company officials said they had got used to the continual verbal duelling between Beijing and Washington with concrete measures being avoided at the last minute.
""With the interests of both sides at stake, the verbal warnings will finally be replaced by mutual concessions,"" said Li Shounan, head of the general manager's office in Shanghai Lianhua Fibre Co Ltd.
""The overall amount under threat is not large and when it comes to an individual company, the impact is even less. We do not expect much effect,"" said an official with Shanghai Sanmao Textile Co Ltd.
But a spokeswoman for Shanghai Jiafeng Co Ltd said its products were involved in the dispute.
""There will surely be some impact if a trade war breaks out though it is hard to immediately to assess to what extent,"" she said.
China's annual apparel and textile exports to the United States are estimated at around $4.2 billion. About 30 garment and textile companies are listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
In the most recent clash in Sino-American trade relations, Beijing said on Sunday it would temporarily ban imports of selected U.S. textiles, farm goods, fruits and alcoholic drinks from December 10 in retaliation for U.S. sanctions taken against Chinese textiles.
Washington announced in September that it would cut China's textile import quota for 1995 by $19 million in retaliation after accusing China of shipping through third countries to avoid quotas agreed upon in a bilateral textile accord.
""Textile companies have performed very poorly in the past two years due to a slump of the industry and we do not expect any major impact even with a trade war,"" said one broker with China Shandong Securities Co.
""But a handful of firms closely linked to Chinese-U.S. trade will possibly be affected,"" he added.
""Who cares?"" said a Shanghai-based investment analyst with a Hong Kong securities brokerage. ""They (the listed textile firms) have done so poorly that few investors are interested in them.""
Some Chinese officials have said they believe there is a political agenda behind the U.S. trade threats against China.
""The U.S. penalties were announced before the U.S. elections and we believe they were closely linked to (U.S. President Bill) Clinton's political needs,"" said one official.

22,"Last week's stern crackdown on China's stock markets has increased the speculative instinct of investors to trade on rumours of policy shifts rather than on fundamentals, analysts said on Monday.
The share markets started their latest bull run in April when Beijing announced it would support the markets.
Rumours and guesses about Beijing's attitude and plans have been the primary trading factor ever since, the analysts said.
While the Beijing authorities have been trying to convince investors to look more at long-term investment based on the fundamentals of the economy and of individual companies, they again chose an old-fashioned means of reining in the markets.
""The crackdown has shown again the risk of policy changes for China's stock markets,"" said an executive with a major Chinese securities house.
""Policy changes have been a very hot speculative topic in the past and the use of administrative orders like this to cool down the markets will make them an even hotter topic in the long run,"" he added.
Beijing last Monday charged that China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were overheated and warned that Beijing would not come to investors' rescue if the markets crashed.
""The action has cooled speculative activity for now,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""But the investment pattern has not changed. It is still political issues which drive the stock market up and down.""
In the shake-out last week, investors generally took refuge in blue-chip shares and dumped the so-called ""rubbish shares"" which have soared in recent months on the basis of little more than an impression that Beijing wanted the markets up.
""Retail investors have turned more to blue-chip shares,"" said a trader. ""Their prices have been stable despite the crackdown.""
Analysts said market psychology could have been better influenced if the authorities had pulled share prices back down using market means such as the issue of more shares or the listing of some state or institutional shares.
One key problem of the Chinese share markets is the lack of suitable supervisory mechanisms and regulations, leading to widespread irregularities such as share price manipulation and the use of credit for stock trading, the analysts said.
""With a stock market law lacking and regulations incomplete, many trading activities are in a legal no-man's land, making it difficult to check irregularities,"" said one stock analyst.
The draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted any time soon partly due to differences over who will have the final say on securities policy, the analysts said.
Responsibility for securities policy at present overlaps between the Securities Commission under the State Council (cabinet), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People's Bank of China, or central bank.
Shanghai's domestic A share index rose 17.606 points or 1.91 percent on Monday to end at 939.946 after losing about 20 percent in last week's trading. The foreign currency B share index was up 0.944 points or 1.48 percent to 64.687.

22,"Foreign business people said on Friday they expected Deng Xiaoping's death to have almost no affect at all on either economic policies or the immense problems they face in making money in China.
Analysts said foreign money had now become an indispensible part of the government's efforts to keep unemployment down and the economy growing, and there was no prospect of any fundamental shift.
Lance Browne, Standard Chartered Bank's China manager, said he expected no change in policy toward foreign banks, nor in the speed and extent to which they can expand their business in China.
""It could hardly be any slower, and speeding it up, that's unlikely too,"" he said.
""Business people at this point see virtually no impact on their operations, either with regard to policy or the problems they face,"" said a Western diplomat in Shanghai.
Foreign businesses have been placed under ever-greater profit pressure in the past year as various preferential policies applied previously have been cut back or abolished to give domestic companies greater room to manoeuvre.
""There could be a further tightening of policy on the privileges applied, but that was going on before and has nothing to do with the death of Deng,"" the diplomat said.
Deng, China's paramount leader, died late on Wednesday aged 92.
An American businessman in the automobile sector in Shanghai said he saw no impact from Deng's death, but reported an increasing sense of concern among foreign business about the problems of getting approvals and making a profit in China.
""People are investing heavily, but there is a great sense of disappointment and unhappiness,"" he said.
""This has nothing to do with Deng, but it will be important to see how the leadership absorbs this,"" he said.
Hoong Yik Luen, investment analyst with ING-Barings in Shanghai, said foreign funds had become a key part of government efforts to keep the economy growing and unemployment down.
""They wouldn't be able to change the policy on foreign investment, they couldn't afford it,"" he said. ""Unemployment would probably be 20 percent now instead of 15 percent if it wasn't for foreign investment.""
An investment analyst based in Hong Kong said major foreign corporations were committed to investing in China almost regardless of what happens.
""The fact that there has been almost no impact on investment flows from the roll-back on the preferential policies shows how much momentum investment has, and there's no reason for the Chinese to shift their policy on taking in money,"" the analyst said.
""I see no change at all in the short term,"" said Standard Chartered's Lance Browne.
""There hasn't been a sense that the reforms are controversial inside the leadership for years. Had it been controversial, it would be different,"" he said.
But Chinese officials appear to be concerned about the topic.
One foreign businessman said he had been visited by officials asking for his view on the possible impact of Deng's death on foreign investment in the country.
""They are asking the same questions you are asking -- what effect Deng's death will have on investment decisions,"" the businessman, who declined to be named, said.
""I told them the feeling was that there would be no effect,"" he added.
""But of course it could be the calm before the storm. We'll have to see how strong the leadership looks in six months. There are always people in the wings who would like to replace them,"" he said.

22,"China's stock markets saw heavy turnover on Monday but little change to the key indices as the impact of Deng Xiaoping's death faded and profit-taking set in, analysts said.
Investors expect little chance of any political problems emerging to shake the markets, at least for the next few weeks, they said.
""It seems to be all very stable,"" said stock analyst Alex Conroy with ING-Barings in Shanghai. ""I expect range trading for a while. There's no particular reason to be trading in a frenzy.""
Shanghai's domestic A share index edged down 0.77 percent to 1,055.078 points on heavy volume of 1.02 billion shares while the B share index was little changed at 65.707 points, inching up just 0.21 percent against the close on Friday last week.
In Shenzhen, the A index rose 0.95 percent to 362.69 points and the B index lost 0.15 percent to 150.73 points.
""The markets were under profit-taking pressure after the past two trading days of rises,"" said a Shanghai-based A share dealer with China Guotai Securities.
""Institutional speculative buying of heavily-weighted stocks pushed the (Shanghai B share) index up, but most investors took a wait-and-see attitude as Deng's death has been factored in and there is nothing else happening,"" said one broker.
Traders said the markets had expected Deng's death to be this year's biggest negative factor. But the relative calm in the market on Thursday and Friday following Deng's death on Wednesday has helped improve sentiment.
""Shenzhen's A share index extended gains into Monday with fewer worries about stability in China after Deng Xiaoping's death,"" said a Shenzhen-based broker.
Some stock analysts said the markets, in the near-term, would likely move in line with company results and technical factors.
""The most important factors in the short term will be company results with the annual report season now getting into full swing,"" said one analyst.
""The (Shanghai's B share) market has entered a correction peroid, and the performance of individual stocks will depend on their annual results,"" said a broker.
But others are more cautious.
""I expect most investors to stay on the sidelines in the next few days, waiting for market-moving incentives,"" a Shenzhen-based analyst with a major Chinese brokerage said.
""I would suggest investors have more cash in hand as market sentiment does not appear quite stable,"" a broker said.
The Shanghai Securities News on Monday predicted the stock markets will rise steadily in 1997 on the back of an improved national economy.
The newspaper forecast in a commentary that Shanghai's composite index would soon rise to more than 1,100 points. The index closed at 1,009.564 points on Monday.
""The improved macro-economy and financial conditions dictate that stock indices will have an upward trend in 1997,"" the newspaper said.

22,"The most magnificent building of old Shanghai -- the former Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank headquarters on the waterfront Bund -- became a bank once again on Thursday, with a state-run Shanghai bank renting it from the city.
In a signing ceremony in the huge main banking hall of the building, first opened in 1925, the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank took out a 30-year lease on the structure.
The ceremony marked the failure of the city's search to find a foreign bank to rent or buy the structure, long the city's main landmark.
The city had tried to interest a foreign bank in the 24,000-square-metre building, and spent two years discussing terms with Hongkong Bank.
But they failed to reach agreement and Hongkong Bank, which is owned by HSBC Holdings Plc, finally announced it would not to take it back.
Bankers said the city asked for an unrealistically high price and that the building was unsuited for modern banking.
The bank, once a symbol of the financial power of the British empire, was also the Shanghai headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party from 1949 until last year, when city officials moved out, leaving it empty and echoing.
The chairman of the Pudong bank, Zhuang Xiaotan, told reporters that his bank would pay an annual rent of 145 million yuan ($17.47 million) for the building, amounting to about $2 per square metre per day.
Pudong, Shanghai's main development zone across the Huangpu River from the Bund and the bank building, is earmarked to become the new financial heart of the city.
The Pudong Development Bank is building its own multi-storey headquarters there that will be ready in about the year 2000, Zhuang said.
""We will use this building as the bank's headquarters until the new building is ready,"" Zhuang said.
The building and the Pudong development bank are both basically owned by the Shanghai city government, and some analysts said the lease agreement had little significance.
""It's the left hand moving money to the right hand,"" said one analyst with a foreign bank in Shanghai.
But Zhuang denied this was the case.
""We are an independent economic unit and this is a commercial deal,"" he said, adding that the bank would consider sub-letting space in the huge building.

22,"China's stock exchanges remain the most open and most market-driven financial markets in the country despite recent official pressure to rein them in, analysts said on Tuesday.
The foreign exchange, interbank and treasury bill repurchase markets are kept under incredibly tight control by the Beijing authorities, with even tiny movements achieved only with official approval.
""Unlike the stock markets, the funds moving on the money markets are directly linked to China's currency stability and money supply,"" said one interbank market trader.
""The central bank is afraid that any chaos on the markets could result in financial turmoil at either a national or local level,"" he added.
China's futures markets, once home to frenzied, casino-like trading, have been ruthlessly brought to heel over the past year with the authorities forcing speculative funds out to the stock markets, analysts said.
""Stocks are the most open of all China's financial markets,"" said a stock analyst with a major Chinese brokerage. ""There was the crackdown in late 1996, but in fact the central government rarely intervenes in the markets.""
China's stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen plunged in mid-December after the official People's Daily published an article warning of over-heating. Prices are now about 30 percent below their mid-December levels.
Current rules allow for a maximum 10 percent rise or fall in a share price over one trading day, but information flow, while still behind the standards of advanced stock exchanges abroad, is relatively free, analysts said.
On the nation's interbank foreign exchange trading market, by contrast, the People's Bank of China intervenes heavily on a daily basis to keep movements in the Chinese yuan against other currencies within very strict guidelines.
The central bank has its own trading room on the market, which has access to all transaction details, while dealers from other players on the market can only see trades done by their own bank.
Daily volumes are not posted on the market and rate movements of the Chinese yuan against other currencies are strictly limited, traders said.
""We feel very much that we are in an infair position with the central bank knowing everything and us knowing so little,"" said a Chinese foreign exchange trader.
""The tendency therefore is for us not to bother to think or analyse the markets too much. Most of the trading is done in the dark with us just guessing at the central bank's intentions,"" he added.
Traders said the same situation existed on the Chinese yuan interbank market, launched just one year ago, and on the nation's state debt repurchase markets.
They said another factor was that the bulk of funds moving on the money markets were state assets.
""The central bank will not stand by and let them get lost in uncontrolled trading,"" said one trader.

40,"A year after the ValuJet Inc. crash, the top airline regulator suggested Thursday it would be impractical to force air carriers to install fire-safety equipment in passenger cargo holds in less than three years.
Under fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety, the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire supressers in all passenger cargo holds over three years.
House lawmakers, however, accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue, despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so. Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable.
""It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet,"" Barry Valentine, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told a House panel.
""That's the decision. How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation,"" he said.
But Representative John Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican, responded, ""I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible. And if they have to be a little slower, the public probably would like them to be a little slower.""
Airline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft, after initially balking at the dual requirement.
FAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash.
""This is pathetic. The FAA is pathetic. The industry is pathetic,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. ""Any more needless deaths and we're going to crucify you.""
The FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules, which will affect about 3,000 aircraft. But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal.
""Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?"" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee.
Valentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the ""final assembly.""
ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners.
The head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24.
""It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States,"" Hall said.
An FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB.

40,"President Clinton and Congress are again set to look to airwave sales to cut the deficit, although analysts note the radio spectrum is not a bottomless money pit and prices should fall as more space is sold.
""They need to be careful that they're not killing the golden goose,"" said Joe Boyer of Hatfield Associates Inc., a Boulder, Colo. telecommunications consulting firm.
""The issue may be whether the federal government creates a glut of spectrum available,"" said Boyer, noting that such an oversupply would force down prices -- and thus the amount of money the government could fetch through auctions.
Auctions for the rights to use the airwaves have been a cash bonanza for Uncle Sam. Since the summer of 1994, the Federal Communications Commission has raised about $23 billion for the government through 12 spectrum auctions.
The FCC has sold licenses for a new generation of cellular phones known as ""personal communications services,"" or PCS, satellite TV, ""wireless"" cable TV and other services.
""It's been the most valuable asset the government has had to sell in decades,"" said budget analyst Stan Collender of Burson-Marsteller.
The president is set to unveil his fiscal 1998 budget on Feb. 6 for the year that begins next Oct. 1. White House officials have told lawmakers to expect spectrum auctions to be a part of the plan, though details are unclear.
For fiscal 1997, Clinton proposed, among other things, to auction in 2002 the ""analog"" spectrum TV broadcasters would return to the government in the transition to high-definition digital TV. The sale was projected to raise $17 billion.
But more sales could well mean lower prices.
The Congressional Budget Office last year predicted the price of valuable spectrum under 3 GHz -- airwaves that can be used for PCS, digital TV, paging, and other services -- will fall ""as more spectrum is brought to market.""
Already, there are signs of softer prices. A PCS auction that ended last month netted $2.5 billion, down 75 percent from a similar auction last May that raised $10.2 billion.
The average license price tumbled more than 90 percent.
Analysts were quick to note that smaller airwave parcels were auctioned at the latest sale and that financing terms extended by the government were not as attractive.
But they also said the drop reflected the dearth of new money available after the sky-high prices paid at last year's PCS sale and the flood of new entrants to the market.
""If everybody builds out the spectrum that has been acquired in the PCS auctions, there would be more than enough capacity for every man, woman, and child and every household pet in the United States,"" said Boyer.
While more sales could mean lower proceeds, many analysts argue that more auctions also would usher in more competitors to the market -- and thus drive down prices of cellular phone service, pagers, Internet access and other services.
""The first thing you have to think about is 'What's good for getting communications services to the public?'"" said Charles Jackson, of Strategic Policy Research, a consulting firm in Bethesda, Md. ""Only after you've solved that problem do you worry about auction revenues.""
Experts said plenty of spectrum is available to auction. ""There's a lot more spectrum out there,"" said James Gatusso of Citizens for a Sound Economy, a free-market advocacy group.
""There's much, much more that can be done,"" he said.

40,"The Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday it approved Time Warner Inc.'s $6.5 billion purchase of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. after the deal was restructured to meet antitrust laws.
The FTC, in a 3-2 vote, agreed to permit the revised transaction after the agency had alleged the original merger proposal would have allowed Time Warner unilaterally to raise cable-TV prices and limit the choice of programmes.
The two commissioners who voted against the agreement -- Mary Azcuenaga and Roscoe Starek -- said there was no reason to order the deal to be restructured in the first place because it did not violate antitrust laws.
Once formally completed, the merger would create the world's largest media and entertainment concern.
The Federal Communications Commission is expected soon to give its approval. Time Warner and Turner have scheduled separate meetings for Oct. 10 to allow their shareholders to approve the transaction, first announced nearly a year ago.
In response to FTC charges, the merger was restructured to curb cable-TV giant Tele-Communications Inc.'s influence over the new company that is to be formed.
TCI, the nation's largest cable-TV operator, now owns 21 percent of Turner stock and would own about 7.5 percent of a combined Time Warner-Turner under the merger, said the FTC. Time Warner is the No. 2 cable-TV operator.
Under the FTC accord, TCI must spin off its Turner stake to shareholders of Liberty Media Corp., a TCI subsidiary. The spin-off is contingent on a tax-free ruling from the government. Otherwise, TCI's stake would be capped at a 9.2 percent non-voting interest in Time Warner.
TCI's chief, John Malone, and other top TCI officials would be barred from participating in the management of the new Liberty Media corporate entity that is to control the shares.
The accord requires Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel to compete with Turner's Cable News Network.
It also bars Time Warner from discriminating in how much it charges competitors for Turner programmes.
""This settlement would preserve competition and protect consumers from higher cable service prices and reduced programming choices by ensuring that competing cable operators, new technologies and future programmers can gain access to Time Warner/Turner's customers and programming,"" said FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky.
Aside from being the No. 2 cable-TV operator, Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. movie studios and Time, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines. In addition to CNN, Turner also owns film and TV studios, a cartoon cable-TV channel and the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks sports teams.
""We're disappointed that the FTC didn't block the overall deal,"" said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Unions. But he added that he was ""encouraged"" by certain provisions of the agreement ""that should limit anti-competitive behaviour.""

40,"Responding to a dispute with the United States, Canada said Tuesday it plans to develop its own satellite-TV industry rather than rely on U.S. companies such as Tele-Communications Inc. to jump-start the business.
The announcement came just hours after the Federal Communications Commission rejected for a second time a bid by TCI and Colorado-based TelQuest Ventures to beam TV programmes to the United States from two satellites in Canadian-authorised orbits.
The Canadian satellites also would have beamed shows to Canadian households via pizza-sized dishes. The satellites were to have been launched by Telesat Canada, a Montreal-based satellite-communications company. It planned to lease space to both TelQuest and TCI, the No. 1 U.S. cable TV operator.
""My belief is that the time has come for us to proceed with a possible Canada-only solution and my hope is that there will be some companies that will be able to pursue that, including Telesat,"" Canada's minister of industry John Manley told reporters in Ottawa.
Manley plans soon to invite Canadian companies to bid for the ownership and operation of two Canadian satellites.
He told Telesat in a letter Monday he would revoke his ministry's support for the company to have access to the two satellite slots, unless the FCC gave the needed green light.
The FCC, however, rejected the TCI and TelQuest requests by noting that the Canadian government had not yet officially licensed the two satellites. The FCC had issued the same decision earlier in the summer, prompting TelQuest and TCI in August to file emergency requests for FCC approval.
Lawyers and government officials said the basis of the dispute stems from the Clinton administration's objection to allowing a Canadian satellite to beam programmes into the United States -- while U.S. companies cannot enjoy the same rights to broadcast into Canada.
In July, administration officials urged the FCC to defer action on TCI and TelQuest's bid to offer direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services from the Canadian orbital slots.
Officials from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the State Department said in a letter to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt that the requests ""raise foreign, trade or competition policy issues within the jurisdiction of the Executive Branch.""
They argued that Canadian curbs discriminate against U.S. programmers by requiring a minimum amount of Canadian content in TV, cable and satellite-TV broadcasts. They asserted  that Canada maintains curbs on the use of non-Canadian satellites to distribute phone and broadcast services to Canada.
In his letter to Telesat, Manley noted that U.S. officials rejected proposals to allow the TCI-TelQuest venture to proceed, while not addressing the issue of Canada's content restrictions on programming.
""The Canadians are going to insist on retaining their protectionist policies on content. And since the U.S. will not accept those policies, the Canadian are picking up their DBS marbles and going home,"" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.

40,"Opponents of U.S. trade concessions to China are expected to mount the fiercest congressional battle in years to overturn President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's favoured trading status.
While supporters of the president's decision on Monday to renew China's most favoured nation (MFN) status for another year remain confident of victory, opponents -- ranging from social conservatives to organised labour -- are revving up for a fight.
The unusual coalition is blasting the move from both sides of the political spectrum, hitting China's policies on human rights, labour rights, religious rights, trade and abortion.
Opponents are also gathering strength from worries over the transfer this summer of Hong Kong to China, as well as the brouhaha over charges that Beijing tried to sway U.S. elections through illegal campaign contributions.
""With Hong Kong and campaign finance lurking in the background, it will definitely be a tougher fight,"" a congressional aide, who requested anonymity, said. ""A lot depends on what happens between now and the vote.""
Another congressional aide said, ""The coalition of the AFL-CIO and social conservatives makes for a potent force.""
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said this year's decision would be closer than last year's 286-141 vote in the House to back Clinton on MFN. But advocates and even opponents expect the president's policy ultimately to survive.
Even if lawmakers muster enough votes to reject the president's decision -- which is considered unlikely -- opponents doubt they could round up the two-thirds vote needed to override an expected veto from Clinton.
Congress later this summer will vote on whether to overturn Clinton's decision, with the House voting first.
""The opponents have a better chance than they have had in the past several years. But it still may not be enough of a margin to withstand a veto,"" said Thea Lee, international expert at the AFL-CIO, which opposes MFN status for China.
But even a defeat for MFN's opponents could amount to a sort of victory if the vote is close enough.
""It represents an important turning point in the growing uneasiness among both Democrats and Republicans over the current China trade policy,"" Lee said.
Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said: ""The president's action represents the high-water mark of the pro-MFN forces. As the truth of the human rights violations in China reaches the American public, the case for MFN collapses.""
A sign Clinton will face tougher sledding emerged a week ago, when an influential House Republican leader urged the president to revoke China's MFN status, citing Beijing's record on human rights, weapon sales and trade.
Representative Bill Paxon of New York, a Gingrich ally who chairs meetings of the Republican House leadership team, said current U.S. policy had yielded only ""a Chinese regime which thumbs its nose at the United States and places its heel on the neck of freedom.""
Democratic lawmakers echo that view.
Since Clinton ""delinked trade from human rights three years ago, the human rights situation in China and Tibet has deteriorated, the U.S. trade deficit with China has soared, and China's authoritarian government has continued its sale of nuclear, chemical, missile and biological weapons technology to dangerous countries, including Iran,"" Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said.
But supporters of the administration's policy remain confident. ""In the end, the votes will be there for MFN,"" said Calman Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, representing the heads of big U.S. corporations.

40,"Regulators Monday approved long-delayed plans to auction two airwave licenses to create new nationwide radio services that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite and offer CD-quality reception.
The Federal Communications Commission, in resolving a long-standing dispute among its four comissioners, said it will limit the April 1 sale to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital audio radio -- instead of opening the auction to any company.
The four are: CD Radio Inc. of Washington, D.C.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston, Va.; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp. of Seattle; and Primosphere LP of New York.
To receive the new service, listeners will have to buy a special radio receiver that will cost about $200, in addition to the price of a regular radio, according to industry estimates.
It is likely the new service will be subscription-based, with an expected cost of about $10 a month. Operators will be able to offer specialised programming.
CD Radio, which pioneered the digital radio concept, plans to provide 30 channels of commercial-free music programming if it wins one of the two licenses up for grabs.
The company would target persons who drive a lot or live in rural areas and do not have access to many radio stations.
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt and Commissioner Susan Ness had favoured opening the auction of the licenses to any bidders, instead of limiting it to the four.
But they were unable to get the other two commissioners at the FCC -- Rachelle Chong and James Quello -- to agree.
""I would prefer to assign spectrum licenses through an auction open to all. Closing the auction is the wrong result,"" Hundt said in a statement.
An open auction could have raised a larger sum for the government by attracting more deep-pocketed bidders.
Hundt noted recently that MCI Communications Corp. last year paid $683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programmes nationwide.
The commissioners, in resolving another dispute, agreed to require the license winners to offer discounted advertising rates and equal time to political candidates running for federal office.
The agency also told the applicants that the winners could be subject to other public-interest obligations in the future.
The FCC is ready to unveil plans to auction a separate valuable airwave slice that will be home to a wireless technology that could offer new competition to local phone companies and cable-television operators.
A government official said the FCC plans to announce soon its long-awaited auction plans for local multipoint distribution service, or LMDS, a wireless technology that allows users to zap voice, pictures and data over high-speed networks that also can hook up to the Internet.
""All the issues have been resolved,"" said the official.
The FCC is expected to bar local carriers and cable firms from bidding for LMDS licenses in their home territories in a bid to bar them from snuffing out potential competition.

40,"The state of Alaska has asked the Federal Communications Commission to ban broadcast advertising of hard liquor, adding to the controversy over whether liquor ads should be allowed on television and radio.
Lawyers said the state's petition -- backed by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop -- was significant.
It could be used at the least as a vehicle within the FCC to generate public debate on the issue, or as a catalyst leading to rules restricting broadcast liquor promotions.
""Whenever you have a state formally asking the FCC to step in, it legitimises the involvement of the commission for any 'doubting Thomases' that might remain,"" said attorney Nick Allard of Latham &amp; Watkins.
The FCC is divided over the issue. Chairman Reed Hundt favours banning the ads if TV stations refuse to abide by a voluntary ban. But two of the FCC's four commissioners have doubts over the FCC's authority to act in the matter.
FCC officials have yet to decide how to handle the Alaska request, which was submitted last month but drew little notice. They also have not yet decided how to respond to a recent bipartisan request from 26 members of Congress asking the FCC to open a formal investigation into broadcast liquor ads.
The split among commissioners has stymied action for now.
The Federal Trade Commission has opened a formal investigation into alcoholic beverage advertising on TV, both for liquor and beer. It is training its sights for now on distiller Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons and the Stroh Brewery Co. Seagram is a subsidiary of Montreal-based Seagram Co.
Alaska, in its petition, asserted that the FCC does have the jurisdiction to act and called for speedy action.
""Advertising of distilled spirits on television and radio will inevitably increase the use of this potent drug among the nation's young people,"" Alaska said in its petition, written by the state's attorney general, Bruce Botelho, and Assistant Attorney General Stephen Slotnick.
The petition cited data showing that Alaska's per-capita alcohol consumption was third-highest in the nation in 1994.
Alaska made its request after the nation's distillers last month ended their decades-old voluntary ban on broadcast ads. It had been in place since 1936 for radio and 1948 for TV.
In June, Seagram began airing TV ads for its Royal Crown whiskey in Texas.
Some dismissed Alaska's bid.
""It's fair to say the Alaska proposal and (the state's) alcohol problem have more to do with a lack of sunlight than whether Seagram advertises for its whiskey,"" said attorney Robert Corn-Revere of Hogan &amp; Hartson.
""An FCC ban of hard-liquor advertising would have a very hard chance of surviving judicial review,"" he added.
But others said a carefully crafted FCC proposal -- such as restricting the ads until after 10 p.m. or later -- could withstand judicial scrutiny. ""The courts have looked favourably on regulations designed to protect children,"" said attorney George Vradenberg of Latham &amp; Watkins.
Lawyers said the FCC must decide what, if any, action it wants to take. Some within the FCC suggest putting the Alaska and congressional requests out for public comment to allow the agency to learn more about the issue.
""Let's take it one step at a time,"" said an FCC official.

40,"The brouhaha over Newt Gingrich's intercepted telephone call has shed light on how easy it is to eavesdrop on cellular calls and how seldom cases are prosecuted -- even though the law is violated daily.
""It's had the chilling effect of reminding us all that anyone at any time could be listening to our most private conversations,"" Rep. Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said of the widely publicized incident involving the House speaker.
Tauzin, who chairs the House of Representatives telecommunications subcommittee, has called for hearings into cellular privacy.
Federal law makes it a crime to intentionally intercept or disclose the contents of a telephone call, regardeless of whether it is over a hard-wired, cellular or cordless phone.
But experts can cite only a handful of cell-phone cases that have drawn publicity. Politicians have been involved.
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said that in the case of cellular calls, the law is ""seldom used"" and the department ""seldom"" gets complaints.
For one, people rarely know when they have been overheard on their cell phone. And the complicated law is little known.
In once case, Sen. Charles Robb, a Virginia Democrat, got into hot water in 1991 over an illegal tape recording of a cellular call made by a political rival, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder. Robb was spared indictment. Four associates pleaded guilty in the case.
Another case in 1990 centered on an intercepted cell-phone conversation involving then-Rep. Bill Sarpalius, a Democrat from Texas.
Tapes and transcripts of the call -- in which Sarpalius spoke with a young woman about a date and a possible job -- were made available to local media. Two unrelated men were later fined about $250 each in connection with the incident.
Why the dearth of legal action?
""Violations of this law are very, very hard to detect. That is why there are so few cases,"" said Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University of America in Washington.
""The person whose privacy is invaded usually never hears about it and so does not alert authorities.""
What's more, the eavesdroppers usually are not familiar with the people they are monitoring. Penalties generally are light, except in cases involving repeat offenses or use of the information to commit another crime.
The only times a case does seem to arise is when the perpetrator tries to capitalize on the conversation.
""It doesn't come to light unless somebody makes political or commercial use of the information,"" said Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.
Yet experts agree the law is broken frequently -- possibly hundreds or thousands of times a day -- given the availability and use of scanners that can tune in wireless calls. It's estimated that anywhere from 10 million to 20 million scanners are in use nationwide, many able to eavesdrop on cellular calls.
""While the cellular industry may give their customers the illusion of privacy by assuring customers that it is illegal to listen, and that cellular-capable scanners are no longer manufactured or imported into the United States, millions of Americans do listen in,"" according to Bob Grove, publisher of Monitoring Times Magazine.
Last week, the FBI opened an investigation into the taping and leaking of a telephone conference call between Gingrich and his top lieutenants. The probe came after a Florida couple said they  delivered a tape of the cellular phone conversation to the senior Democrat on the House Ethics Committee.
A transcript of the tape was published in two newspapers two days later, prompting Republican calls for an FBI criminal probe into the source of the leak.
""You're not going to see the law enforced unless it involves a person of rank, such as a politician,"" said Linus Layne Baker, a Kansas City, Mo. attorney who was fined in the Texas case. ""You won't see the media prosecuted either.""
One option under study in wake of the Gingrich incident is whether to beef up a law that outlaws the sale, manufacture or imporation of scanners capable of picking up cellular calls.

40,"Television and Hollywood moguls on Thursday formally unveiled their controversial system to rate TV programmes, ushering in a new era meant to enable parents to control their kids' viewing habits better.
Broadcast and cable-TV networks will begin displaying the six ratings categories at the start of shows as soon as Jan. 2. The ratings will appear briefly as a small icon in the upper left-hand corner of the TV screen.
The age-based system is similar to the 28-year-old motion-picture industry ratings and will apply to nearly all shows, including cartoons and talk shows. News and sports programmes will be exempted.
President Bill Clinton, appearing in the Oval Office with leading TV and Hollywood executives, called the new ratings a ""huge step forward over what we have now, which is nothing.""
While not endorsing the system, Clinton said the ratings ""are going to give America's families more help in choosing appropriate television programming for their children.""
Even before its unveiling, the system had drawn flak from lawmakers, parent groups, children's advocates, educators and others. They want the ratings content-based, specifying the level of sex, violence and strong language.
The ratings are: TV-G for suitable for all ages; TV-PG for parental guidance suggested; TV-14 for parents of children under 14 strongly cautioned; TV-M for mature audiences only and two categories applying to children's shows: TV-Y for all children and TV-Y7 for kids seven and older.
Executives said they expected programmes such as ""Hard Copy"" and ""Entertainment Tonight"" to receive ratings instead of being exempted as bona fide news programmes.
""Our goal was to create TV parental guidelines which would be simple to use, easy to understand and handy to find, and we have accomplished it,"" said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America and head of the group that developed the television ratings.
The group included representatives from the broadcast and cable-TV industries and Hollywood. ""We don't claim any divine inspiration,"" Valenti told a news conference, adding that the system was ""not written in stone."" Industry executives plan to review the ratings over the next few months.
""What we are presenting is our best offer,"" Valenti said.
Networks and producers will rate their own shows, unlike the movie industry, where an independent panel rates films. TV executives argue they have far more programmes to rate, with up to 2,000 hours a day of shows, equivalent to about 1,000 movies a day.
Critics, while welcoming the system, say it is vague, does not go far enough and will prove unhelpful to parents. Child advocacy, public health, religious and education groups plan a campaign to see that a content-based system is developed. They favour an approach in which letters such as V, S and L are used to denote the level of violence, sex and bad language.
""The system which they propose is too complicted. It's too vague. It doesn't give parents the information which they need in their homes for their kids,"" said Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts and a vocal critic of the TV industry plan. He called on the industry to test both the aged-based and content-based systems side by side in the home.
But industry officials said a content-based plan would be unwieldly. They said their own system would be more practical for parents, and more convenient for newspapers to print.
The ratings stem from the telecommunications law enacted in February that requires new TV sets to include a ""V-chip."" The technology, expected to be available in a year or so, will be used in conjunction with the ratings and allow parents to screen out programmes they do not want their children to watch.
Clinton last week gave the system a conditional green light, saying critics should allow the TV industry to test the ratings for 10 months before demanding changes.
Top officials at the Federal Communications Commission will review the ratings over the next few weeks. Under the telecommunications law, the FCC must set up an advisory panel to devise a ratings system if the industry fails within a year to craft an ""acceptable"" plan.
Valenti vowed to fight any government-imposed system in court on First Amendment free speech grounds.

40,"An obscure part of the new telecommunications law could restrict how phone companies use confidential customer data to peddle everything from calling plans and caller I.D. to Internet access and credit cards.
The law pits consumer advocates who fear an onslaught of telemarketers and a loss of personal privacy against local, long-distance and cellular carriers wanting to offer their customers one-stop shopping in the new communications age.
The data, which include billing records and calling patterns, are taking on added importance as local and long-distance companies, cable-TV operators and others brace to get into each other's business under the new telecom law.
""Everybody wants to use these data -- subject to the law -- for their marketing efforts, given that it's a much more competitive environment now,"" said attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe &amp; Johnson. ""There are new technologies and new markets for the companies.""
The Federal Communications Commission is drafting rules to spell out the limits set by Congress on the use of ""customer proprietary network information."" CPNI details when calls are made, the destination, the frequency and length, the number and type of phone lines ordered, and the price of the bill.
Few curbs existed before the new telecom law. The new FCC rules -- which stem from a provision in the law pushed by Representative Edward Markey, D-Mass., -- are expected in early 1997.
The agency must decide what form of customer approval a carrier must receive before using the data for marketing.
The rules will determine, for example, what if any okay is needed for a carrier to use a customer's long-distance calling pattern to pitch a cellular service if a customer is seen to make plenty of calls from the road.
Many phone companies want the FCC to avoid stringent rules requiring detailed customer approval. Industry executives argue that consumers would benefit from flexibile rules that let companies target a customer's communications needs.
""It would give us the opportunity to tailor their package of services to what they need and what they want,"" said James Spurlock, AT&amp;T Corp.'s director of federal government affairs.
But consumer and privacy groups fear the data could fall into the wrong hands without tough curbs and clear approval.
They also fear an explosion in telemarketing: Companies could use CPNI to market a vast array of products and services unrelated to the phone service a customer actually receives.
""When consumers sign up for telehone service, they don't expect the information to be used to market non-phone services such as credit cards or investment information,"" said John Windhausen, general counsel for the Competition Policy Institute (CPI), a consumer advocacy group.
Companies already use the information. Long-distance carriers pitch cheaper plans based on a customer's calling habits. The marketing is expected to heat up.
Under contention at the FCC is whether a company can use the data derived from its long-distance business to pitch local or cellular service, without prior customer assent.
The telecom law lets carriers use CPNI without prior approval when supplying the service a customer ordered.
The FCC has proposed to classify phone service under three categories: local, long distance and cellular. CPNI from one could not be used to market another without a customer's okay.
A number of phone companies, including several regional Baby Bell companies, have asked the FCC for just one broad category that would give them greater marketing flexibility.
Texas phone regulators, by contrast, propose categories based on ""the exact services (the customer) has ordered.""
The FCC also has proposed requiring phone companies to notify customers of their right to restrict access to CPNI.
Under contention is whether the notification should be oral or written, such as a notice stuffed into a bill or posted in the ""white pages"" phone directory.
Consumer advocates, privacy groups and state regulators want advance written approval for use of the information.
Some companies -- AT&amp;T, several of the Bells and GTE Corp. -- suggest that no response to a detailed notification about a customer's CPNI rights should amount to a customer's blessing.

45,"China on Wednesday told U.S. President Bill Clinton not to worry about Chinese human rights and Hong Kong's future freedoms, saying Beijing's rights record spoke for itself and liberty in the British colony was assured.
Clinton said on Tuesday that Washington had made less progress than hoped in influencing Chinese rights policies and warned that Hong Kong's value to China might fall if liberties in the colony were lost after it returns to Beijing's rule.
""The national conditions of China and the United States are not the same and it is natural for different views on human rights to exist,"" said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in reaction to Clinton's comments.
The reaction -- exceedingly mild by Beijing's standards -- came as Chinese and U.S. officials met in the capital to discuss trade and human rights, issues that have long dogged the cross-Pacific relationship.
In its report on Clinton's remarks, China's official Xinhua news agency mentioned only the U.S. president's defence of his engagement policy towards China, and said nothing of his comment that liberty's advance in the authoritarian communist nation was inevitable.
Analysts said Beijing was determined to keep up the momentum of a recent Sino-U.S. rapprochement and would not allow it to be derailed by Clinton's remarks on Hong Kong and human rights.
Concerns over the future of the British colony, which reverts to China at midnight on June 30, were unfounded, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.
China had guaranteed freedom for Hong Kong's people with its mini-constitution for the territory, the Basic Law, she said.
""Under the Basic Law the people of Hong Kong have full freedom and all democratic rights,"" she said. ""There is no basis or need for doubt or concern about this.""
China's own constitution and laws protected the rights of members of all its nationalities, she said.
""The efforts and achievements made by the Chinese government in this area are there for all to see,"" she said. ""Anyone who is not biased will reach a fair conclusion.""
A U.S. delegation arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks on human rights with Chinese officials, after a year in which almost all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement were either imprisoned or driven into exile.
The delegation was seeking concessions that could make it unnecessary this year for Washington to sponsor a U.N. resolution faulting China's rights policy, U.S. officials said.
A Western diplomat in Beijing said the delegation's arrival was a sign of Chinese and U.S. determination to bolster the recent warming in ties that has helped soften the impact of disputes over issues ranging from Taiwan to copyright piracy.
However, the delegation was unlikely to extract sufficient clear concessions from Beijing to make it politically viable for Clinton not to sponsor a critical resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in March, the diplomat said.
Talks on issues such as human rights should take overall ties into account and should be carried out on a basis of equality, the Chinese spokeswoman said.

45,"Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said on Monday he had expressed disapproval to his Chinese counterpart over the jailing of dissident Wang Dan.
Persson raised the case of former student leader Wang, jailed last week for 11 years, during a dinner with Chinese Premier Li Peng in Beijing on Sunday, he told a news conference.
A court in the Chinese capital last Wednesday took less than four hours to condemn Wang for plotting against the government, after a trial that sparked expressions of concern from around the world.
""During the official talks of the delegation we talked about human rights in general,"" Persson said.
Asked about the case of Wang Dan he said the 27-year-old dissident had not been discussed in the official talks but had been raised afterwards.
""During the dinner I had the opportunity to have a more private discussion with Premier Li Peng and raised that case you mentioned, Wang Dan,"" he said.
""I told him what we have said before...that we don't like the treament in this case,"" he said.
Persson, who has drawn political fire at home for his decision to carry out the six-day visit despite Wang's jailing, declined to give details of the talks or to describe Premier Li's reaction to the raising of Wang's case.
It was more efficient to raise such cases as Wang's in private at a dinner than during official talks because China considered such matters internal affairs, he said, adding that Sweden firmly believed in continuing dialogue on human rights.
""We...think that China treats its political dissidents and religious dissidents too hard and are also critical towards their frequent use of capital punishment,"" he said.
""We have signed an agreement with China where the Swedish Raoul Wallenberg Institute will arrange human rights seminars in Sweden and China...for officials from the prisons and the judicial system,"" he said but did not elaborate.
The jailing of Wang Dan was latest in a series of crushing blows to China's tiny and struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or adminstrative detention.
Sweden and China had signed an agreement on a consulate for Hong Kong, which returns to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997, he said adding that his discussions with Chinese leaders had also touched on international politics and trade.
A delegation of Swedish businessmen was travelling with the prime minister during his visit and was expected to sign a number of deals, Persson said but gave no details.

45,"China on Sunday used a Long March 2D rocket to fire a scientific research satellite into orbit from a base in the remote northwestern province of Gansu, the Xinhua news agency said.
The successful launch of the remote-sensing satellite followed a string of setbacks for the Chinese space industry that have sent insurance premiums for commercial launches soaring.
""The satellite went smoothly into orbit and all instruments aboard are operating well,"" Xinhua said.
The launch of the satellite, which is designed to spend 15 days in orbit before returning to earth for retrieval, was the third successfully completed by the two-stage, liquid-fuelled Long March 2D rocket, the official agency said.
China's space industry, once much admired for its bargain prices and its strong track record of launch successes, has been plagued by problems in recent years.
In August, a domestic communications satellite launched aboard a Long March 3 rocket from Xichang in the southwestern province of Sichuan failed to reach its proper orbit.
In February, a Long March 3B carrying an Intelsat satellite veered wildly seconds after lift-off before exploding in mid-air near the Xichang space centre.
China said six people were killed, 57 injured and 80 homes destroyed in the incident. Video footage smuggled out of China by an Israeli scientist showed dozens of levelled buildings and suggested the casualties were higher.
Chinese officials said the loss of the rocket and its payload was caused by a failure of the ""inertia platform"" that operates the rocket's directional controls.
In January 1995, a Long March 2E rocket blew up, killing a family of six in a rain of debris and destroying the Hughes-built Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.
The failures, although hardly exceptional in the high-risk satellite business, have sent insurance premiums for Chinese launches soaring, eroding China's price advantage over Western and Japanese competitors.
Several launch contracts with foreign companies were cancelled following the setbacks, partly because of concerns over delays due to China's launch backlog.
China says it still has a high success rate, with only a handful of the 43 launches carried out by its Long March rocket series going wrong, and officials said this month they had tightened safety measures to prevent further disasters.
Launch vehicles would now self-destruct in the case of failure and officials would ensure people living nearby are evacuated before each launch.
In July, China took a step towards restoration its reputation for reliability when it successfully launched the Apstar 1A satellite.

45,"The head of China's restive northwestern Xinjiang on Friday accused western nations of working with pro-independence activists to try to split the nation, saying no end was in sight in the war on separatism.
Activists in the mainly-Moslem district had fomented riots and carried out political killings, but their struggle against Beijing rule was bound to fail, chairman of the Xinjiang autonomous region, Ablait Abdureschit, told reporters here.
""Against the strategic background of some people internationally engaging in splitting and westernising China, there is a small clique who want to split Xinjiang from China and achieve independence,"" he said.
""To achieve their objectives they take all kinds of actions; they infiltrate, make propaganda, carry out assassinations and create riots,"" he said.
""The vast majority of Xinjiang people resolutely oppose such activities,"" he said, adding western conspiracies to divide China could never succeed.
Separatists stood against the economic progress that Beijing was bringing to a region where development had long lagged behind other areas of China, he said, accusing un-named western nations of conspiring with pro-independence activists.
""In the last few years some western countries have concentrated on engaging in activities to westernise and split China,"" he said. ""...In Xinjiang, the separatists have cooperated with the international conspiracy to westernise and split China.""
Authorities in Xinjiang this year intensified a crackdown on separatists and unauthorised religious activity after a series of violent clashes, bombings and assassinations of officials and Islamic leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.
The arid region, described by officials as a sunny ""Land of Fruit and Melons"", is considered by many Chinese a wild frontier province and has a long history of ethnic unrest between the native Uighur population and members of China's Han majority.
In May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's long borders to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.
Ablait Abdureschit said only a few people were involved in separatist activities in the region, but acknowledged the struggle against separatism was unlikely to end soon.
""Nationalist separatist activities occurred in the past, occur now, and will occur in the future, abroad and also within the country,"" he said. ""This struggle is long-term and complicated.""
Despite the struggle against separatism, the outlook was bright for the sprawling region, which borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mainly-Moslem central Asian states from the former Soviet Union, Ablait Abdureschit said.
Beijing, which provided more than 40 percent of the region's government budget, was working hard to boost the economy and improve Xinjiang's links with the outside world, he said.
The resource-rich region was aiming to become one of the country's top grain producers by the end of the century and had already gathered a record cotton harvest of 1.05 million tonnes in 1996, while oil and gas resources were abundant, he said.
""The general situation in Xinjiang is good,"" he said.

45,"After four years of Sino-U.S. ties laced with near-miss trade wars, rhetorical broadsides and diplomatic sparring over human rights, Beijing is hoping for a new post-election approach from Washington.
Bill Clinton's electoral triumph on Tuesday may mean no change of occupant in the White House, but Beijing is hoping for a second-term transformation of the Democratic president's policy on China, diplomats and analysts said on Thursday.
""After this election (Clinton) doesn't need to worry about attracting votes,"" said Tong Tianqi, a international relations researcher at an institute under the State Council, or cabinet.
""We hope he will take a practical approach... it's possible he will change his approach,"" Tong said.
Relations between Beijing and Washington have been badly strained for years by disputes over trade, human rights, arms proliferation and Taiwan, but both sides say ties have warmed recently after a series of high-level meetings.
Beijing's hopes for change in Clinton's China policy are the flip side of the desire for stability in the fragile Sino-U.S. relationship that made Chinese academics and officials welcome his victory as the return of a devil they knew.
""The most important thing for us is stability in U.S. policy,"" said an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
After four years in office Clinton was a familar face to a Beijing leadership that preferred to deal with statesmen it knew, and the U.S. president's understanding of China had also grown, the analysts said.
Chinese officials and state media have spotlighted what they call U.S. obstruction to Beijing's long-coveted accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a key area of dispute.
China blames Washington for blocking its entry to the global trade body on favourable terms as a developing country, while U.S. officials say Beijing must do more to open its markets.
Chinese hopes for change in Washington's approach could be borne out as U.S. electoral passions faded, but deep-rooted differences meant the path of Sino-U.S. ties over the next four years was unlikely to run smooth, diplomats in Beijing said.
""The Chinese will be thinking: is this the point at which the Americans might kick in with some new set of suggestions on either WTO or human rights cooperation, or both,"" said a Western diplomat. ""I wouldn't be suprised if there were some.""
Clinton's meeting with Chinese president Jiang Zemin in the Philippines later this month on the fringes of a regional economic forum would be a key opportunity to bolster ties, diplomats said.
The presidential face-to-face will be the latest in a string of high-level contacts that officials on both sides hope will set relations on a more stable footing and lead to an eventual exchange of state visits.
While there appeared to be few immediate threats to the new Sino-U.S. cordiality, issues such as copyright piracy in China -- which has twice led both sides to the brink of a trade war -- and Taiwan would continue to dog ties, the diplomats said.
China's growing U.S. trade surplus would continue to raise hackles in Washington, while Beijing's human rights record would remain a major stumbling block -- despite the release on medical parole of dissident Chen Ziming on Wednesday, they said.
Chen's release came just seven days after a Beijing court jailed former student leader Wang Dan for 11 years following a brief trial that prompted U.S. expressions of deep concern.
Wang's sentence was just the latest blow to China's tiny band of pro-democracy dissidents, most of whom were already in exile or serving long sentences in detention or jail.
Washington was tired of scuffling with Beijing over its treatment of dissidents, but China would need to make bigger concessions if it hoped to bring an end to the annual threat of U.S.-backed censure at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, said a diplomat.
""I don't think that (Chen's release) would be effective,"" he said. ""It's pretty small compared with what went before.""

45,"China's power minister vowed Thursday to protect the interests of foreign investors expected to provide one-fifth of the 700 billion yuan ($84 billion) to be invested in power generation between 1996 and 2000.
Foreign investment in the electricity generation sector would be carefully channelled to boost China's domestic industry, power minister Shi Dazhen told a business conference.
""We have established a legal framework to protect foreign investors,"" Shi told reporters at the conference.
Beijing would perfect its laws and regulations to ensure that investor interests were guaranteed, he said.
China's electricity generating capacity would hit 290,000 megawatts by the end of 2000 from 217,000 megawatts at the end of 1995, Shi said.
China would require around 700 billion yuan ($84.4 million) investment in the power sector during Beijing's state-set ninth five-year plan, which runs from 1996-2000, he said.
Foreign investors were expected to come up with 20 percent -- around $17 billion -- while the central government provided 40 percent and local authorities and enterprises shelled out the remaining 40 percent, he said but gave no details.
The investment estimates appeared to be lower than those made by other senior power officials last month, who said China would need $20 billion from abroad.
Shi said he was unaware of the $20 billion figure.
Potential foreign investors have said an effective 15 percent limit on returns on investment from Chinese power plant projects is a major disincentive, but Shi waved aside such concerns, saying any specific limit would be impractical.
Chinese energy officials have consistently denied setting any limit on returns, although they have said the best rate from key projects is around 17 percent.
Chinese electricity prices are fixed by the state, which has kept prices low.
Shi said foreign investors remained keen to put their money behind Chinese efforts to build enough generating capacity to keep up with rocketing economic growth and to raise per capita capacity from the meagre 180 watts achieved by the end of 1995.
""Although the power industry has developed very quickly, because China has a population of 1.2 billion, the power supply is still very tight and the supply level is very low,"" he said.
""There is great enthusiasm among foreigners to invest in this sector,"" he said, adding that such investment should be carefully guided.
""The use of foreign investment must be combined with that of China's own power manufacturing industry, with foreign funds used to buy Chinese-made generating equipment,"" he said.
Foreign funds would be focused on high technology plants with capacity of 300 megawatts or more, he said.
Beijing says it wants to replace inefficient thermal power stations that burn dirty high-sulphur coal with larger new plants and with nuclear and hydro-electric projects.

45,"Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Wednesday greeted future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa with a pledge of support, saying the appointment of the tycoon turned chief executive designate marked the dawn of new era.
""Of course, I will support him,"" Jiang told reporters during a meeting in Beijing with Tung, who will lead the British colony after it returns to Chinese rule on July 1 next year.
""This is indeed the start of a new era,"" he said.
Tung, a shipping magnate who will become Hong Kong's first Chinese chief executive after more than 150 years of colonial rule from London, was in Beijing to meet senior leaders after his formal appointment on Monday by Premier Li Peng.
The visit is being keenly watched by residents in the territory eager to know more about Tung's plans for his first post-colonial adminstration and to learn whether current senior civil servants will keep their jobs.
Tung, who has warned Hong Kong's people to be sensitive to China's sovereign rights, has yet to give details of his plans for the post-colonial administration but has said he will discuss transition issues during his Beijing visit.
He declined to answer questions from reporters on the position of civil servants before beginning talks with Jiang in Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People.
It was Jiang who in January signalled that the tycoon was China's favourite for chief executive by singling him out for a warm, personal handshake at a reception in Beijing.
A 400-member, Beijing-controlled Selection Committee of Hong Kong residents last week made the choice official when a sweeping 80 percent majority of members backed the 59-year-old tycoon.
At a meeting at Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house, Premier Li Peng gave Tung a certificate of appointment and congratulated him on his success. ""This is indeed an historic moment,"" Li told reporters.
Earlier on Wednesday, Tung met Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at the guesthouse, but neither he nor Qian made any public comment.
One of Tung's first tasks in the twilight of British rule will be to put together an advisory cabinet called the Executive Council and to decide which senior civil servants to keep -- a subject of much speculation among Hong Kong's boisterous media.
While heated interest has focused on Tung's intentions for current senior administrators, China said on Tuesday that it would make the final decision on important civil servants.
""For senior officials, they need the nomination of the top administrative official and to finally obtain appointment by the central government,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said at a news briefing.
China has hailed Tung's appointment as the fruit of its principle of Hong Kong autonomy, but the selection process was dogged by protests from democrats who accuse Beijing of using its hand-picked committee to stage-manage the choice.
Beijing's critics believe it is likely try to control Hong Kong and its 6.3 million people from behind the scenes after the five-star Chinese flag is raised over the territory.
The Beijing-backed Selection Committee that chose Tung is now preparing for the selection on Saturday of a 60-member, ""provisional legislature"" with which China plans to replace the existing, elected legislature on July 1.
Hong Kong's colonial governor Chris Patten has condemned the new legislature as undemocratic and has vowed not to cooperate with it.

45,"China said Monday that it restrained inflation while maintaining strong economic growth in 1996 and it predicted it will do even better next year despite soaring government-sector losses and slumping individual incomes.
The State Statistical Bureau quoted preliminary 1996 figures showing China's gross domestic product grew at an estimated 9.7 percent to 6.8 trilliion yuan ($816 billion) while inflation fell to 6.0 percent from 14.8 percent.
Despite soaring losses in the state sector and falling incomes for many urban households, the statistics showed China's economy had returned safely to earth after a period of high inflation and runaway growth, bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said.
""The national economy maintained its rapid and stable growth, indicating a successful 'soft landing,'"" Ye told a news conference in Beijing.
China will do even better in 1997, he said.
""Preliminary estimates show overall growth will continue with the same stability and high speed as this year,"" he said.
Annual economic growth in 1997 was expected to rise to 10.5 percent, while inflation -- which soared to a communist-era high of 21.4 percent in 1994 -- will stay at this year's level, Ye said.
China has set a target of 8.0 percent growth for 1996 to try to cool the economy, down from 10.2 percent last year and a sizzling 11.8 percent the previous year.
The 6.0 percent figure for 1996 retail price inflation, China's benchmark price index, was well below the government's 10 percent target for the year.
Consumer price inflation was estimated at about 8.3 percent, compared with 17.1 percent in 1995.
While some economists have expressed doubts about the accuracy of Beijing's inflation figures, it was clear that once-fierce price rises have been largely controlled, said Jason Kwok, chief economist at Citibank Hong Kong and China.
""It all tends to suggest that the macroeconomy is doing very well this year,"" Kwok said in a telephone interview.
Two recent interest rate cuts and China's second-half turnaround of an earlier poor export performance meant growth could edge up next year even without a loosening of Beijing's 42-month-old tight credit policy, Kwok said.
Stable growth next year was likely to receive an external boost from an expected upward trend in exports, which the statistical bureau said had powered China to an estimated $16 billion trade surplus in 1996, he said.
Beijing will keep the lid on credit growth and continue to put high priority on restraining price rises, Ye said.

45,"A sprawling new copper production group in China's southwestern Yunnan province is planning to boost minerals output in the nation's ""kingdom of non-ferrous metals"", senior company officials said on Friday.
Yunnan Copper Industry (Group) Co, which opened for business this month after the merger of Yunnan's biggest copper mines, bureaux and a major smelter, had mapped out a five-year plan to increase production, said general manager Zhou Paixiang.
Metals officials had ordered the group's creation to boost efficiency and make metals exploitation a bulwark of the economy in Yunnan, one of China's poorest provinces, group president Zou Shaolu told Reuters.
""Minerals resources are very rich here,"" Zou said in an interview. ""This is the 'kingdom of non-ferrous metals'.""
Output of electrolytic copper would be raised to 150,000 tonnes a year by 2000, increasing from 90,000 tonnes last year, said Zhou, the general manager.
The group's mines would wrest about 60,000 tonnes of copper ore a year from Yunnan's mountains, up from 45,000 tonnes, he said.
""Formation of the group will improve distribution of resources and personnel and bring the strengths of the companies into play,"" said Zou, the president. ""We have to find ways to raise productivity, together we are stronger.""
The shortfall between mine output and demand at its smelters would be made up by buying on the domestic and international markets, Zou said.
Copper imports for the smelters were expected to reach an annual 50,000 tonnes or more by 2000, he said. The Yunnan group already accounted for about one-ninth of China's copper output, he added.
Managers said copper would remain the core business of the sprawling group, which also mines minerals such as gold, silver and zinc and makes consumer goods ranging from traditional furniture to soft drinks.
The group's 3.14 billion yuan ($378 million) assets included hundreds of subsidiary companies, with only about one-half of its 34,000 employees involved in copper production.
The group would try to progressively spin off many of its ventures and would also move to reduce the heavy burden of its welfare commitments, Zhou said, adding that medical costs for its employees were a major expense.
The group's diversity helps protect against price fluctuations in the copper market, he said.
Copper prices slumped after the disclosure of huge trading losses by Japanese trading giant Sumitomo Corp, though they have since recovered some of the lost ground.
The Yunnan group planned to raise gold production to five tonnes a year in 2000 from three tonnes currently, boost silver output to 150 tonnes from 100 tonnes, zinc to 20,000 from about 10,000 tonnes and sulfuric acid to 300,000 tonnes from about 200,000 tonnes, managers said.
Shortages of capital were a major difficulty and the group was in talks with foreign companies to create possible joint venture projects, Zhou said.
""We have made some connections with foreign firms but so far we have no fixed plans,"" he said without giving further details.

45,"More than 250 Chinese citizens have called on Beijing's top military leaders to take tough action in a dispute with Tokyo over a group of islands in the East China Sea, a petition organiser said on Sunday.
Beijing should send Chinese forces to the disputed Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus, to destroy a makeshift lighthouse built there by a right-wing Japanese group in July, organiser Tong Zeng said in a telephone interview.
""We are calling for troops to be sent to get rid of the Japanese lighthouse,"" Tong said. ""Japan has violated our territorial integrity...we are very angry.""
The rare petition was addressed to Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and chairman of the Central State Military Commission, and to other top military leaders. It had been signed by 257 ordinary citizens, Tong said.
Petitioners included officials, retired servicemen, workers and students, he said.
Tong is a leading anti-Japanese campaigner in China whose high-profile approach led authorities to confiscate his passport and order him to leave Beijing temporarily during last year's 50th anniversary of the Japanese surrender.
Beijing and its arch-rival, Chinese Nationalist-ruled Taipei, both claim the Diaoyu Islands, which are located about 300 km (190 miles) west of Okinawa and 200 km (125 miles) east of Taiwan.
Tokyo says the uninhabited group has always been part of Japan.
The dispute over the islands' ownership flared in July after the Nihon Seinen-sha (Japan Youth Federation) moved to buttress Japan's claims by building an aluminium lighthouse on one of them, prompting howls of protest from China's state media.
""The Chinese side must take strong and concrete action to protect our nation's territorial integrity,"" the Chinese petitioners wrote in their appeal to Beijing.
The military should immediately remove the five-metre (16-ft) Japanese lighthouse, or at least should send warships to protect any Taiwanese or Hong Kong groups who attempted to destroy it, they said.
While China's Communist Party-controlled media quickly condemns any perceived signs of resurgent Japanese militarism, Beijing has in the past suppressed unofficial protests against Tokyo and campaigns for Japanese compensation for war victims.
Petitions to parliament judged hostile to the government have often prompted the detention of signatories, but Tong said the Diaoyu petition was a private move by ordinary people that would be welcomed by the Beijing leadership.
""There is nothing wrong with this action, this is to protect China,"" he said. ""I think the government could not but welcome it.""

41,"Quaker Oats Co. Thursday reported a profit for the fourth quarter, reversing a year-ago loss, but said its Snapple beverage business was unprofitable and continued to be a disappointment.
Quaker said Snapple's U.S. and Canadian sales dropped 8 percent in 1996, with volume down 11 percent. Sales of its six-flavor Diet Snapple line, however, rose 23 percent in 1996.
Chicago-based Quaker said it earned $18.1 million, or 12 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $47.8 million, or 36 cents a share, in the 1995 period. Excluding a $40.8 million pretax restructuring charge in the 1995 fourth quarter, Quaker posted a year-ago operating loss 18 cents a share.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.06 billion, down 10 percent from $1.18 billion a year earlier, which included $90.3 million from divested businesses.
For the full year, Quaker said it earned $244 million, or $1.80 a share, which included a $113.4 million gain on divested business. In 1995, it earned $720 million, or $5.39 per share, with a $1.05 billion gain.
Sales last year were $5.20 billion, 13 percent below the previous year's $5.95 billion, which included $796.9 million from divested businesses.
""This was a rebound year in which our largest, value-driving businesses -- U.S. and Canadian foods and worldwide Gatorade -- increased their operating profits,"" Chairman William Smithburg said in a statement.
A $100 million cutback in advertising and marketing costs in 1996 also helped results, analysts added.
In a conference call, Smithburg said Quaker was committed to at least 10 percent real earnings growth in 1997. ""We're going to try like crazy to do even better than that,"" he said.
Quaker management again pledged to turn around Snapple, which it bought over two years ago for $1.8 billion.
""We need to stabilize (Snapple's) volume"" in 1997, Smithburg said. ""Our goal is to operate Snapple at cash positive in 1997.""
Cash positive means Snapple is expected to be profitable, excluding goodwill charges of about $50 million a year.
Quaker surprised some analysts by not taking a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce Snapple's value. Analysts had expected Quaker to take a large writedown for Snapple, potentially as high as $1 billion.
Smithburg declined to comment on speculation and rumors that Quaker was looking to sell Snapple, a fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business, and its Gatorade sports drink.
He said Quaker's management continues to review steps to ""create value for shareholders,"" but declined to be specific.
Gatorade, Quaker's largest brand, had a strong year in 1996, Smithburg said, with sales volume rising 6 percent in the fourth quarter and 4 percent year-to-date.
Gatorade is launching this year a ""Frost"" line of Gatorade beverages that will feature a ""cooling taste,"" Smithburg said. ""The trade acceptance has been nothing short of terrific.""
Smithburg said the company's hot cereals business had a strong year, with sales volume up 9 percent.
Ready-to-eat cereals, such as Cap'n Crunch and Life, gained 3 percent in volume for 1996. The value-priced line of bagged cereals grew more than 40 percent in the year.
Quaker stock was down 62.5 cents at $35.875 in afternoon trading.

41,"Just days after pleading guilty to price fixing and agreeing to pay $100 million in fines, Archer Daniels Midland Co. lost two key executives Thursday, as the giant agricultural products company remained dogged by controversy.
ADM said Michael Andreas, vice chairman and son of influential Chairman Dwayne Andreas, took a temporary leave, and Terrance Wilson, a vice president in charge of corn refining, retired for medical reasons relating to progressive heart disease.
Michael Andreas and Wilson are being investigated by the Justice Department in connection with a price-fixing scheme.
The Decatur, Ill.-based company, which advertises itself as ""Supermarket to the World,"" has said previously that indictments were being considered against Wilson and Michael Andreas.
On Tuesday, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of pricing-fixing and agreed to pay $100 million in fines to the federal government, the largest penalty ever in a criminal antritust case.
That day, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gary Spratling said federal authorities were still gathering evidence in the case involving Wilson and Michael Andreas.
William Leach, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said some had expected Wilson and Michael Andreas to step down. ""I'd say it's hardly unexpected given the circumstances,"" he said.
The announcement that Michael Andreas was taking leave and Wilson had retired came after the company's shareholder meeting Thursday at its central Illinois headquarters here. No mention of the investigation of the two executives was made by the company during the meeting.
Dwayne Andreas, like other ADM officials who spoke at the meeting, used mostly euphemisms when referring to ADM's guilty pleas to two counts of pricing-fixing and an agreement to pay $100 million in fines to the U.S. government.
""I acknowledge to you that this occurred on my watch as chairman of your company,"" Dwayne Andreas told shareholders at the annual meeting here. ""You have my apology and my commitment that things are arranged so that this will never happen again.""
One of the few direct mentions of the antitrust investigation came in response to a question from Ed Durkin of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, an institutional shareholder.
Durkin asked why ADM had not notified shareholders officially of its guilty pleas to two counts of price fixing and the $100 million plea. Richard Reising, corporate secretary and general counsel, said the company did not consider it necessary given the amount of publicity the antitrust settlement received.
ADM board member Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada, told shareholders the ""consensual resolution"" with the Justice Department was reached after negotiations with the board's special committee of independent directors.
""This has been a terribly unfortunate experience for the company and we as a committee deeply deplore it,"" Mulroney said.""It is our intention to ensure that the company learns from mistakes in the past and acts so that they never happen again,"" Mulroney said.
A proposal requiring the board be composed of a majority of independent directors was defeated, but received 42 percent of the votes cast.
Other shareholder proposals addressing corporate governance issues did not pass. ADM's slate of 12 directors was approved by about 89 percent of the votes cast, the company announced.
The new board, which was reduced in number from 17, was hailed by ADM as a more independent body since Dwayne Andreas is the only company executive remaining on the board.
The antitrust investigation sparked criticism from some large shareholders who questioned the independence of ADM's board of directors and its ability to oversee management.
In a statement released following the meeting, Charles Valdes, chairman of the the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), said ""Calpers will continue to meet with directors and pursue the wishes of shareholders that want a majority of independent directors and increased oversight of the ADM board.""

41,"Despite losing out on two potential aircraft deals, McDonnell Douglas Corp's stock remains near its 52-week high, reflecting a strong balance sheet and expectations it will make an acquisition.
""The company is generating on the order of about $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion of free cash flow annually, which translates into between $5 and $7 a share,"" said BT Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch, who has a buy rating on the stock.
That could enable the company to buy back shares or make a long-awaited defense acquisition, he added.  
Although it lost out on the race to build a next generation fighter for the Pentagon and rival Boeing Co was awarded a 103-plane AMR Corp deal, McDonnell Douglas shares remain relatively strong.  Shares were down $0.25 at $52.625 a share on Monday, $4.125 below a 52-week high of $56.75 but more than $10 above a low of $42.125.
In fact, losing out on the potential $2.2 billion in jet fighter contracts -- which could eventually be worth as much as $500 billion to the ultimate winner -- could prompt McDonnell Douglas to pursue an acquisition aggressively to build its defense business, analysts added.  
CS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said he expected the company's ""board and management to take a fairly proactive stance...to do something in the merger and acquisition area.""
Analysts also shrugged off Boeing getting the plane order from AMR's American Airlines, saying McDonnell Douglas was not a serious contender after it cancelled development of its next generation commercial plane, known as the MD-XX.
""They were never in the running,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Byron Callan said of McDonnell Douglas.  
""The events don't affect near-term earnings in either case,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Howard Rubel said of the lost jet fighter and American Airlines deals.
McDonnell Douglas management said the Pentagon business would have been a significant long-term program for it.  But analysts said the company still has a chance to capture future military sales, particularly with acquisitions to build its portfolio, which now includes the F-18 fighter jet, C-17 military cargo plane and Apache helicopter.  
""The things to keep in mind are, the joint strike fighter is a long ways away.  It doesn't affect McDonnell Douglas' business portfolio near term,"" Callan said.
Callan added it is possible the new fighter jet might not be developed due to U.S. government budget pressures. And, in the interim, McDonnell Douglas could make its existing fighter jets more affordable and more capable.
Analysts dismissed the ideas that takeover speculation has been boosting McDonnell Douglas shares.  Earlier this year, McDonnell Douglas was reported to be in preliminary merger talks with Boeing, but a deal never materialized.  ""I don't think the people who own the stock today are looking at McDonnell Douglas as a takeover candidate,"" Callan said.

41,"McDonald's Corp. just turned up the heat in the fast-food business.
If franchisees go along with the plan, the world's largest restaurant chain will launch its biggest nationwide promotion ever, featuring 55-cent sandwiches, down from about $1.95 for a Big Mac, according to franchisee sources.
The plan is a bold stept to lure customers into McDonald's restaurants in the face of intense competition in the nation's giant fast-food industry.
McDonald's, which has more than 20,000 units worldwide and more than 12,000 in the United States, declined to give specifics on its plan. Spokesman Jack Daly said the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company hopes to launch a ""national value-price promotion.""
Pointing to a current promotion on Chicken McNugget sandwiches, which analysts said has helped McDonald's build sales this month, Daly said, ""It's in that same spirit.""
Charles Gonzales, a McDonald's franchisee with two units in the San Francisco area, said the nationwide promotion would feature a different sandwich for 55 cents each month when a customer buys french fries and a drink at the regular price.
The promotion, he added, is expected to start with the Big Mac hamburger, which is usually priced between $1.90 and $1.99, and will include breakfast sandwiches as well, he said.
But the promotion, to be presented to franchisees on Thursday, could spark a price war, analysts said. That prospect worried investors who drove fast-food stocks sharply lower.
""Everyone will have something for 55 cents. Now it's a zero-sum game again,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok.
But Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, may not match McDonald's price promotions right away.
""There are a lot of things (companies can do) to enhance value without directly cutting prices,"" Adelman said, including increasing the frequency of regular promotions.
Earlier, Burger King said it had no plans to change its prices. Wendy's officials were not immediately available.
McDonald's stock tumbled $2.625 to $44.625 and Wendy's slid $1.50 to $20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares were among the most active issues. American shares of Britain's Grand Metropolitan Plc, which owns Burger King, fell $1 to $30.625, also on the NYSE.
Dean Witter's Adelman said it remained to be seen if the McDonald's plan will bring in more customers. ""We have much more jaded consumers today,"" he said, noting price cuts were not ""new news.""
Gonzales noted some franchisees oppose price promotions since they often do not boost customer traffic enough to offset lower sandwich prices. Moreover, regular customers may be tempted to order whatever sandwich is being offered that month instead of higher-priced menu items, he said.
Daly, however, said increased sales volume is expected to offset lower menu prices. ""Margins (are) a function of volume,"" he added.
Dick Adams, chairman of the Consortium, an independent association of McDonald's franchisees, said he expected the promotion plan to be approved.
""They (franchisees) are going to vote for it,"" Adams said. ""They are being told that it's the only plan that is available.""
He said McDonald's was expected to present the plan in a satellite broadcast to operators across the country on Thursday.
McDonald's has been looking to boost domestic sales, which have been pressured because of competition. In a December 1996 memo to owners and operators, Jack Greenberg, chairman of McDonald's U.S.A. said, ""We must re-energise and focus our U.S. marketing efforts and develop a national value proposition.""

41,"Nalco Chemical Co Chairman Ted Mooney said he is comfortable with analysts' estimates for fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $0.50 to $0.51 per fully diluted share, up from $0.45 from continuing operations a year ago.
""We're comfortable with that,"" Mooney said in a telephone interview.  
Looking ahead, the water treatment and process chemicals company expects to increase earnings by a double-digit rate.
""Our overall goal is to grow double-digit, and we certainly think we can do that many more years than not,"" Mooney said. ""Next year, we don't see as atypical as yet.""
Earlier this week, Nalco reported third quarter earnings of $0.52 per fully diluted share from continuing operations, up 16 percent from $0.45 a year ago.
To increase its business, which is roughly equally divided between water treatment and process chemicals, Nalco will continue to make strategic acquisitions, Mooney said.  
Earlier today, Nalco, based in Naperville, Ill., agreed to acquire Nutmeg Technologies Inc, a Connecticut-based water treatment company with $9 million in annual sales.
""They (Nutmeg) are operating in an area that is growing rapidly and also have some very fine people,"" Mooney said.
Technical personnel in the water treatment business are a key asset given the range of customers served, from manufacturers to hospitals. Nalco's technology treats both water intake as well as water that is discharged.
Nalco also provides process chemicals to a variety of industries, such as paper-making.  
Nalco is also split in half between the United States and foreign markets, currently operating in about 20 countries.
With a global presence, Nalco, with about $1.4 billion in annual sales, is able to pursue opportunities wherever they arise, Mooney said. One down side, however, is that such globalization also makes it suspectible to regional economic downturns.  
For example, Nalco's European division, which accounts for 25 percent of its foreign business, faces tough economic conditions there. And as a U.S. company, Nalco's European profits suffer when converted into a stronger U.S. dollar.
""We are growing in dollar terms, if at all, very slowly in Europe right now,"" Mooney said.
Balancing that weakness in Europe, Nalco is growing by about double-digits in the United States, which accounts for about half the business.  
Nalco's business in the Asia/Pacific market, which accounts for 12 to 13 percent of company revenue, currently is growing at 15 to 20 percent. In Latin America, which also accounts for 12 to 13 percent of Nalco's business, growth is running at 15 to 20 percent, Mooney said.
""Wherever in the world it is, we'll go after that opportunity,"" Mooney said.

41,"Wm. Wrigley Jr Co said Thursday it is looking for ways to help revitalize the domestic chewing gum market, which saw about a one percent drop in physical sales volume in 1996.
""We have to bring new news to the category...either in advertising, merchandising (or) improved products,"" William Piet, vice president of corporate affairs and corporate secretary, said in an interview after a presentation at an analysts' conference here.  
Piet cautioned that last year's decline in the overall domestic chewing gum market does not signal ""a disaster,"" adding that the industry has been growing at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent.
""It's a knock on the door,"" Piet said of the decline.
Despite the decline in the domestic market, Wrigley's chewing gum brands at the end of 1996 surpassed about a 50 percent market share, up a little more than one point.  
North America accounts for roughly 46 percent of Wrigley's business, but Wrigley continues to grow overseas. This year it will add Cambodia to the list of some 120 countries where it sells products. Cambodia will be supplied out of a new replacement factory in the Philippines, along with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
Wrigley also plans to begin construction this spring for a new factory in Russia. That plant, which was previously announced, is expected to be in operation in early 1999.
With the Russia facility, Wrigley will have plants in 13 countries outside the United States.
Piet said growth in the international market varies from year to year, but said over 10 years the growth rate has been about four times that of the domestic market.

41,"ReliaStar Financial Corp chairman John Turner said Monday his company's $488 million merger deal with Security-Connecticut Corp would broaden the insurance products sold by both firms.
""We identified Security-Connecticut as a company that was positioned in the market with both product lines and distribution that fit very well with ours. They were strong where we weren't so strong, and we had products that we were sure their distribution chain could sell,"" Turner said in a telephone interview.  
The merger of the two companies in a stock-for-stock transaction, which values Security-Connecticut at $47 a share, is expected to result in at least $7.0 million in annual pretax cost reductions.
Another $2.0 million may be saved with the planned consolidation of ReliaStar's and Security-Connecticut's New York operations, Turner added.
But ReliaStar expects to reap the main benefit of the deal on its top line.
""The big payoff is in the cross-selling,"" Turner said.  
For example, Minneapolis-based ReliaStar has variable life and annuity products that expand Security-Connecticut's offerings. Avon, Conn.-based Security-Connecticut has second-to-die universal life and term life products, which cover two lives, that complement ReliaStar.
""Cross-selling works best when products and distribution are complementary and not redundant,"" Dain Bosworth analyst J. Chris Sergeant. ""It's set up to be successful.""
Turner said the deal will not hurt earnings in 1997 and will be ""a little accretive"" in 1998, which also reflects a planned $100 million share buyback of ReliaStar stock.  
Security-Connecticut shares were up eight at 45-1/2 at midday, reflecting the offer price.
""I think it's a good deal,"" Nutmeg Securities analyst Ira Zuckerman said. ""ReliaStar picked up an excellent marketing operation.""
ReliaStar shares were off 1/4 at 59, which Sergeant said reflects the near-term neutral earnings impact.
""The stock has done very well already,"" he said.
One advantage for Security-Connecticut in the deal is gaining access to a stronger balance sheet to back up the claims paying ability of its life insurance operation. That, Sergeant said, opens the potential for an upgrade by ratings agencies.
Turner said the Security-Connecticut deal fits its criterion of a 16 percent return on equity and will not derail its goal of a 13 percent increase in earnings per share.
""What we say is we intend to attain (these goals) without acquisitions, but we also readily recognize that consolidation is occurring in our industry,"" he added.
After the Security-Connecticut deal, ReliaStar would become the 11th largest publicly held life insurance holding company in the United States.

41,"Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, which set records for sales, profit and beer volume in 1996, said Wednesday it continues to aim for a double-digit percentage increase in its earnings per share in 1997.
""Our projection for this year is double-digits...EPS growth,"" W. Randolph ""Randy"" Baker, chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview.
Anheuser, which brews Budweiser and Michelob beer, earned $2.21 a share from continuing operations in 1996, up 11 percent from $1.99 in 1995, both before extraordinary items.  
For the fourth quarter, it earned $0.30 a share, in line with analysts' expectations, compared with earnings from continuing operations, and excluding charges, of $0.27 a share in the 1995 fourth quarter. The year-ago fourth quarter results exclude $160.0 million in costs for closing a Tampa, Fla., brewery and $74.5 million in costs for wholesale inventory reductions.
""As we end 1996 and begin 1997, we do so in a position of great competitive strength and we have set the stage for significant long-term earnings growth for 1997,"" Baker said.  
Gross sales for 1996, before excise taxes, were a record $12.6 billion in 1996, up four percent from 1995.
Anheuser said it sold a record 91.1 million barrels of beer in 1996, up 4.1 percent from 1995. Adjusting for an inventory reduction in 1995, beer volume grew 2.8 percent.
The company also boosted its leading domestic market share in 1996 by 1.1 points to 45.2 percent.
""The volume growth remains very, very good,"" Oppenheimer and Co analyst Roy Burry said. ""That's the problem.""
With Anheuser being the only U.S. major brewer to gain market share, competition has intensified, Burry said.  
In spite of the increased competition, Baker said Anheuser implemented about a three percent price increase, equal to $0.10 to $0.15 per six-pack of beer, in much of the United States this month. This followed a similar price increase in seven states in September and October of 1996.
He said it is too soon to tell if the price increases are holding. But preliminary reports indicate Anheuser's major competitors are following the price move on their premium brands in a majority of markets, he added.
Internationally, Anheuser reaped a double-digit increase in sales volume in 1996, Baker said, continuing a trend for this business.
International brewing profit dropped slightly in 1996 compared to 1995, due in part to increased marketing expenses.
Anheuser has been building its overseas beer business with ventures and investments in foreign brewers. In December, it increased its ownership in Grupo Modelo SA de CV to 37 percent for an investment of about $550 million.
The company said its Busch Entertainment theme park subsidiary made a significant contribution to earnings in 1996, with its fifth consecutive year of record attendance and profitability.

McDonald's Corp dominates the landscape with about 12,000 U.S. units and over 20,000 worldwide. But in spite of a new menu, its U.S. same-store sales are below year-ago levels.
""This will be their sixth consecutive quarter of lower comps (same store sales) in the U.S.,"" Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said, referring to the fourth quarter of 1996.
Wendy's International Inc, on the other hand, has seen U.S. same store sales rise five to six percent in the fourth quarter, following an eight percent gain in the third quarter. Spokesman Denny Lynch declined to comment.
""Wendy's..., although their margins have been squeezed, has the best traffic of the big three,"" said Roger Lipton of Lipton Financial Services.
Wendy's has about 4,425 U.S. units and 4,925 worldwide.
Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, said its U.S. same-store sales rose 2.6 percent for fiscal 1996 ended September 30.
Burger King had 8,696 units worldwide at the end of fiscal 1996, including more than 6,600 in the United States.
At this point, Wendy's may have the most significant new product offering in 1997, a fresh pita sandwich that is currently being tested in 11 U.S. markets and may be rolled out nationally next year, analysts said.
""It's being given very serious consideration,"" Lynch said of pita sandwiches. ""We're very pleased with the test.""
Adelman said he expects the pita sandwich to be launched in the United States later in 1997, adding, ""That's going to be a material event for (Wendy's).""
In 1996, McDonald's stole the menu spotlight by introducing its Arch Deluxe hamburger, garnished with lettuce, tomato and a mustard-mayonnaise sauce, as well new chicken and fish deluxe sandwiches.
In spite of those new menu items, McDonald's same store sales continued to show declines compared with a year ago.
McDonald's U.S. same store sales showed a negative comparison in the first nine months of 1996, spokesman Chuck Ebeling said, but he declined comment on the fourth quarter.
McDonald's has blamed the drop in its U.S. same store sales in part on an intensely competitive domestic market.
Looking ahead, analysts said the most significant event for McDonald's likely will be the start in 1997 of its 10-year exclusive marketing alliance with Walt Disney Co. That alliance gives McDonald's exclusive rights to marketing tie-ins -- such as toy giveaways -- to Disney movies.
Ebeling said the Disney alliance will be the ""centerpiece"" of McDonald's marketing efforts, ""but not the only thing.""
As for its menu, Ebeling said McDonald's will continue to focus on ""delivering great food taste,"" but he did not comment on new items.

41,"ConAgra Inc said Tuesday its spread of operations across the food chain -- from seed distribution to meat processing and frozen foods -- is a positive for the company that outweighs its exposure to the commodity markets.
""I see it as a great positive,"" ConAgra Chairman Philip Fletcher said in an interview Tuesday. ConAgra was among the food companies presenting at an analyst conference here.  
In the past, ConAgra has faced some criticism for having commodity-sensitive operations that could be a drag on its value-added foods such as its $1.5 billion Healthy Choice line.
""As you look around the globe with the doubling of the population by 2030, they aren't going to be buying frozen foods in a lot of those markets,"" Fletcher said. ""But they sure...are going to be buying a lot of chicken, hogs and...grain (products)...I see the front end of the chain providing us, frankly, a lot more opportunity for the next five or so years than the back end of the chain.""  
Across its scope of food operations, ConAgra continues to seek out acquisitions that typically contribute about one-third of its earnings growth over time, Bruce Rohde, vice chairman, added.
""Every year we do a dozen or so (acquisitions),"" he said.
Fletcher said acquisitions are scouted out by top executives at its various operating divisions, who must then ""sell"" the idea to the corporation.
""We think the acquisition process is one of our strengths,"" Fletcher added.  
Beyond acquisitions, ConAgra continues to grow by new product introductions, particularly in its grocery products division. In the first half of fiscal 1997, ConAgra's grocery products posted a 26 percent rise in operating profits.
""The key driver these days is to make our food much more easy to prepare,"" David Gustin, president of ConAgra Grocery Products, said.
While studies indicate a desire to eat more at home, consumers continue to shy away from traditional cooking.
""This requires a drastic change in our attitude toward what the definition of convenience is,"" Gustin said.
For many consumers, he added, this means meal preparation times of five to 10 minutes.
ConAgra's new products aimed at greater convenience include its Butterball-brand baked chicken and Healthy Choice Hearty Handfuls microwaveable stuffed sandwiches.
Other new products being launched by ConAgra include a line of popcorn snack cakes under its Orville Redenbacher's brand.

18,"Cocoa arrivals in Ivory Coast at the start of the 1996/97 season are slower than normal with exporters awaiting financing and warehouses filling up at the main port, Abidjan, exporters and shipping sources say.
""There is a problem of finding space in the port,"" the head of the exporters' trade body, GEPEX, Rene Ekra, told Reuters.
He and others say delays in issuing export licences and freight rates had blocked shipments of cocoa. Large consignments of cotton were also taking up port space, they added.
Exporters were also unable to secure bank finance without export licences and contracts.
""Some are financing buying operations themselves but up-country buyers are keeping busy,"" said a San Pedro exporter.
Ivory Coast opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season on October 24 with its farmgate price unchanged at 320 CFA per bagged kilo and the cocoa export tax down 10 CFA to 150, but has yet to set reference exporter rates and buyer commissions as well as freight rates.
""Arrivals are lower than normal but we should get back into a rhythm in the next couple of weeks,"" said the San Pedro exporter.
""We are hoping all rates will be out within a fortnight,"" said GEPEX President Ekra. He said 31 exporters were given licences last year but 1996/97 applicants were still waiting for government approval.
About 600 buyers were expected to be approved, he added.
Yves-Marie Koissy, new head of the Caistab cocoa marketing agency which grants licences and sets reference exporter and buyers' commission rates is expected to return from the United States in early November.
Precise arrival figures remain unclear. Market estimates range from 8,000 to 9,000 for San Pedro in the week to October 25 and over 7,000 tonnes for Abidjan.
""It is too early to get a clear picture of quantities. Wait until mid-November,"" said one exporter. ""Last year, arrivals were 180,000 tonnes in November. I think it will be less this year but 950,000 tonnes for the whole year cannot be discounted,"" he added. ""Bean sizes and quality are very good, around 95 per 100 grammes.""
Early arrivals were also greater at San Pedro.
""Liberalisation of transport means it is cheaper to go to the nearest port. If San Pedro exported 30 percent of cocoa last year, it could well be 35 to 40 percent this year (1996/97),"" said the San Pedro exporter.
Buyers around Daloa and Gagnoa said rains were regular with good sunshine. ""There are plenty of flowers. But we need regular showers between now and December for a good April and March crop,"" said Daloa-based buyer Makkram Haddad.
Up-country buyers around Gagnoa and Daloa said some stocks were still held up-country because heavy rains in July, August and in some areas, September had made bush tracks impassable.
""We are buying 20 new three-tonne covered trucks to get through to farmers who cannot move their stocks,"" said Gagnoa buyer Hussaini ""Some tracks have been repaired but there is a lot of damage and 15-tonne trucks are too big.""
Buyers say they usually replace their trucks every two years. One truck importer told Reuters sales were rising.
Sunny weather south of Gagnoa in the past couple of weeks had dried many areas, Khaled and others said. Intermittent rain has continued north of Gagnoa.
Up-country sources said stocks of cocoa being held by buyers in centre-west and south-west areas around Soubre, Daloa, Duekoue and Guilgo would be taken to port when the full scale of marketing costs was known.

""I would prefer to get down to talking about cocoa quality and continuity of supply,"" Cacao Barry managing director Alain Leblond said before the second day of the talks, which end on Friday.
Ivory Coast's Consultative Committee, a tripartite group of Ivorian, industry and donor officials, was set up in 1996 to monitor cocoa sector reforms since 1990.
After opening the talks on Wednesday, International Cocoa Organization Chief Executive Edouard Kouame said changes must benefit farmers and other local players.
""At the same time the legitimate interests of others in the sector must be safeguarded,"" he added, referring to foreign traders, cocoa butter manufacturers, and chocolate and confectionary industries.
An electronic export contract auction set up in May 1996 to increase market transparency is widely seen as encouraging overbidding and concentrating export contracts in a few hands.
Local exporters, allocated 85 percent of contracts, and foreign traders, allocated 15 percent, have complained they cannot win export contracts at favourable prices.
""The question needs to be asked how some people can bid as much as they have (been bidding),"" Cocoa Association of London Chief Executive Philip Sigley told Reuters.
Industry concerns have been voiced about quality since the state marketing monopoly was ended.
""Quality has to do with liberalisation and the auction system,"" Netherlands Cocoa Association Managing Director Louis Bensdorp told Reuters. ""The lack of quality checks is the major problem. That and the second thing, the education of farmers.""
Industry watchers are wondering whether strong arrivals so far in 1996/97 means that output will rival the 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) record of 1.2 million tonnes.
""There is a very good crop coming in which suggests that last year was not a fluke of nature,"" said Bensdorp.
Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze declined to confirm whether buoyant cocoa arrivals would mean an adjustment of the Caistab state marketing board's 1996/97 production forecast of 950,000 tonnes. Industry forecasts are increasingly putting total output at more than one million tonnes.
Industry delegates said mid-crop forecasts for April to September had not yet been finalised.
""It is still too early to talk about the mid-crop but it tends to be bigger and bigger,"" said Bensdorp.
Ivory Coast wants to process 50 percent of its output by 2000 to shore up world prices and add value the cocoa sector's output.
At least two cocoa processors have expressed interest in building factories in Ivory Coast.

18,"Rains in Ivory Coast's southern cocoa belt picked up in late February and an overall deficit stretching into March has not stressed trees too much, weather and crop analysts said on Tuesday.
""Rains have continued along the south coast and in forest areas, and soon we expect them to start moving further to the north,"" said a national weather centre spokesman on Tuesday, adding that there was no reason for trees to be over-stressed.
Crop analysts said trees were beginning to show some reaction to prolonged dry weather but no signs of damage.
""People are forgetting that we had over 200 percent of normal rains in December and January,"" said one. ""We will be in trouble if there are no rains in March but all the signs indicate that will just not be the case.""
Ivorian commodities minister Guy-Alain Gauze said on Monday the 1996/97 crop would be less than one million tonnes, despite private estimates of up to 1.1 million.
""The weather has been very dry, despite reports that it has been raining recently...We do not call this rain,"" he said.
Little or no rain fell in most areas during the first 20 days of February leading to concern that possible damage to trees would reduce mid-crop (April-Sept) potential and reduce bean sizes in developing pods.
But official data for the last eight days of the month show average rainfall at 10 weather stations of 12.24 mm, against 1.31 mm in the previous 10 days and 15.5mm for the last eight days of February last year.
Ivory Coast produced a record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 crop after a bumper 200,000 tonnes mid-crop.
Some industry forecasters raised 1996/97 crop estimates after strong main crop arrivals. Mid-crop prospects are expected to be clearer by mid-March as pod counters complete tallies.
Late mid-crop volumes depend partly on rains up to April.
""Normally we get a bit more rain in early March but they are a bit late,"" said the weather centre spokesman. ""If dry weather continues until the end of the month trees might be over-stressed but some stress is normal for this time of year.""
A crop analyst said, ""There is some yellowing of leaves which we usually see in January, but I am not worried.""
Others returning from growing areas said drizzle had fallen in southern regions with isolated thunderstorms.
""There was not much rain but we are still optimistic that levels will increase soon,"" one said. ""My figures show average rainfall of 20 mm for February against (an average) 54 mm.""
Late 1996 rains and a mild January harmattan wind meant the effects of drought in February had not been as harsh as might otherwise have been the case, said crop analaysts.
On some eastern cocoa and coffee plantations, fires that had been started to clear undergrowth had got out of control.
""There has been some damage to badly maintained plantations but on farms we usually visit the fire swept through undergrowth in a flash and did not affect trees,"" said one crop analyst.
""Overall, there doesn't appear to have been much serious damage at all,"" he said. ""It sounds worse than it is, although some coffee farms were burnt to the ground.""
Data from the 10 national weather stations showed the following total rainfall for the last eight days of February in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets)-
Dalao 2.7 mm (0), Gagnoa 20.2 mm (0), San Pedro 12.6 mm (0.1), Tabou 21 mm (0.1) and Man 2.0 mm (0), Dimbokro 32.3 (0), Yamoussoukro 0 mm (0), Abidjan 8.9 mm (2.7), Sassandra 8.8 mm (0), Adiake 13.9 mm (10.3), Korhogo 0 mm (0).
Rains fell in Abidjan on Monday and Tuesday as skies remained overcast.

18,"Ivory Coast plans to flush illegal cocoa and coffee planters out of protected forests but crop production is likely to fall by less than five percent of annual output, say donors and crop analysts.
The government forecast 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) cocoa production of 950,000 tonnes but some private analysts expect closer to 1.1 million tonnes by the time the season ends in September.
Ivory Coast's government said on Friday that 72,000 peasant farmers and their familes were illegally occupying protected forest.
""This explains the gap between our production forecasts and the eventual outcome,"" Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze said on the sidelines of an International Cocoa Organization meeting in London this week. ""It is a big problem,"" he added.
Ivory Coast produced an unexpected record of 1.2 million tonnes of cocoa in 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) and 180,000 tonnes of coffee.
A cabinet statement on measures to protect forests in line with donor loan terms said 72,000 farmers, and a total of 450,000 people, had settled in classified forest.
It gave no timetable for destroying illegal plantations, relocating farmers and reforesting lands.
Donors say protected forest cover has been slashed from 13 million hectares before independance from France in 1960.
""By 1998, only 3.6 million hectares survived,"" World Bank analyst Leandre G'Beli told Reuters on Wednesday.
Peasants slash and burn to clear protected forest, undeterred by the presence of armed guards. Forested areas generally receive better rainfall than deforested areas, which are exposed to drying winds harmful to trees.
""Cocoa production continues its increasing trend, contrary to what many feared,"" said one donor official who would not be named. ""Remaining forests are being put into production.""
Illegal production was concentrated in 21 of Ivory Coast's 60 or more protected forest areas, he added.
One crop researcher regularly making deep forays into forests to assess cocoa crop prospects recently took a helicopter trip over Tai, the largest national forest.
""The forest is now a doughnut,"" he said. ""There is a massive hole in the middle.""
Refugees from Liberia's eight year civil war have been blamed for raising output in Tai where it borders on Liberia but critics say Ivory Coast's traditionally rural population is mainly responsible for swelling crop volumes.
Gauze put illegal output at about 100,000 tonnes but donors say the figure is smaller, due to low labour and land productivity and poorly defined land tenure laws discouraging careful farm management.
""It is less than five percent (of annual production),"" World Bank analyst Leandre Gbeli told Reuters, adding: ""A lot of other forest has been chopped down but that is not protected. The two should not be confused.""
A spokesman for Ivory Coast's state forestry corporation SODEFOR said government eviction plans were not yet clear.
Donors, including the World Bank, have made forest conservation a condition for loans.
""(Cocoa) continues to provide the best remuneration for farmers,"" said one donor official. ""We will believe (the plan) when we see results on the ground... Announcements are not necessarily put into effect.""
Ivory Coast launched a donor-sponsored National Environmental Action Plan in late 1996 which included Forest Sector Projects up to 2010 aimed at working closely with villagers to protect forests. The government is also looking at a new forestry tax regime to augment funds for World Bank-sponsored re-forestation. --Abidjan newsroom +225 21 90 90

18,"Demands for commodity auction rule changes to stop overbidding for cocoa export contracts will dominate talks in Abidjan next week on progress with Ivorian agriculture reforms, donor and industry delegates say.
""We are now ready to revisit the issue and the possibility of amending rules,"" a World Bank official told Reuters.
Ivory Coast's Consultative Committee, set up in October to review progress on a World Bank Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC) timetable, meets in Abidjan on February 5-7.
A clear agenda was expected to emerge after intitial meetings between the Ivorian government, industry and international trade officials.
Exporters want immediate changes to the auction, which is aimed at ensuring price competition and market transparency.
""Exporters have to pay too much, sell at a loss and get into (contract) positions they don't really want,"" one told Reuters.
The World Bank sponsored the auction as part of a $150 million ASAC loan dating back to 1994 on condition that rules and penalties were applied.
""The problem is that the Caistab (Caisse de Stabilisation marketing board) has not given us sales data since September,"" said one bank official.
Contract allocation was previously handled by the Caistab as a state commodity marketing monopoly.
Donors in September agreed to two modifications but said initial overbidding and concentration of export rights in a few hands had waned since the system was put in place in May 1996.
""We cannot wait until next year (Oct-Sept 1997/98) for changes,"" one exporter told Reuters. ""Two thirds of each year is sold forward so new rules would not bite until 1999.""
""Support for the system is disappearing, especially for physicals traders,"" another said. ""There's a lot of forward buying for 1997/98 to ensure smooth debloquage.""
Ivorian ministry officials along with International Cocoa Organization, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, European Union, industry and trading representatives will attend talks.
""The market has certainly fallen below the price of some people's contracts,"" said one exporter. Auction rules were partly the problem but recent low world demand and price could also mean some would hold on to stocks for a March premium.
Warehouses at Ivorian ports are full to normally operating capacity estimated to be at least 380,000 tonnes.
There is also discord over auction penalty rules.
""Penalties are not being applied so the system is really not working,"" one European-based buyer told Reuters.
Exporters say penalties are unclear. ""The rules are too blurred and are being applied when they shouldn't,"" said one.
Export contracts are auctioned in two daily sessions but exporters are banned for five sessions if they fail to put up a bank guarantee of 25 CFA per kilo within three days of bid confirmation by the Caistab.
""We are still in disageement with the Caistab about the levels of interest rates,"" said one exporter. Before the reforms, the Caistab put up guarantees on behalf of exporters.
The World Bank in late 1996 agreed to a proposal for an 85-15 percent split between sales to local exporters and by the Caistab directly to international traders.
""If international traders' bids do not at least match the best local exporters' bid they should not be allowed to buy,"" said one exporter.
The World Bank has not agreed to parts of a GEPEX exporters' forum proposition to spread contracts more widely, between five highest bidders in each session.
""We have agreed the principal of differentiated prices and the 85-15 rule but not the five bidders proposal,"" said a World Bank official.
The World Bank wants bidders held to the price they bid, rather than winning contracts but at the second highest bid price -- a rule which it says encourages overbidding.

18,"Declared cocoa arrivals at Ivorian ports for Ivory Coast's 1996/97 (October-April) main crop totalled 970-980,000 tonnes by April 14, close to record levels seen in the 1995/96 season, exporters and crop analysts said.
The 1995/96 main crop (ending April 30) reached just over a million tonnes.
""Arrivals are now at a trickle compared to last year but it is still possible the total (main crop) will reach a million by the end of the month,"" said one crop analyst.
Exporters said cocoa was arriving at Ivory Coast's two ports -- Abidjan and San Pedro -- at a total of up to 5,000 tonnes a week, compared to 8,000 tonnes a week in 1995/96.
Little or no main crop cocoa remained on south-western plantations visited by Reuters. ""Cocoa is now for the mid-crop (usually smaller, poorer quality beans),"" said one coastal area buyer.
Ivory Coast has forecast 950,000 tonnes for the 1996/97 season but some private forecasters upgraded their full-year predictions from that level to around 1.1 million tonnes after large arrivals in early 1997.
Last year, Ivory Coast produced a full-year record of 1.2 million tonnes after a bumper 200,000 tonne mid-crop (May-September).
Sources said Ministry of Agriculture data showed cocoa arrivals to April 4 (from October 24) stood at 940,0000 tonnes -- about six percent down from 1,003,366 last year. Another 40,000 tonnes or so should be added to the 1996/97 figure as the season opened three weeks later than the usual October 1, they said.
Other arrivals data seen by Reuters gave similar figures.
""The latest figures I have from the Caistab (cocoa and coffee marketing board) show arrivals at about 975,000 by April 14 but that is after some downward adjustments for sub-grade (inferior beans),"" said one source.
Arrivals to the end of the main crop in 1994/95 were 815,000 tonnes, with weekly arrivals of under 4,000 tonnes.
Trade sources say exporters usually over-estimate arrivals early in the season to help secure bank finance, but square accounts later in the season by under-declaring.
Crop forecasters say declared arrivals in Ivory Coast can exceed tree crop harvests as quantities of cocoa are carried between seasons in the hope of price rises and to mix poor with good quality cocoa.
One cocoa buyer for Ivorian exporter Jean-Abile Gal (JAG) said the latest cocoa bean sizes averaged 98 beans per 100 grammes at San Pedro, and 105 at the main port, Abidjan -- against an export standard of up to 105 with less than eight percent humidity.
Exporters said average humidity levels at both ports were below eight percent.
Up-country buyers' stores in coastal and south-western areas were mostly empty, except for coffee, but larger warehouses at San Pedro, including JAG's, were still well stocked.
""There is nothing left. Some exporters are desperate to meet contracts and cannot get cocoa,"" said one buyer. ""Cocoa harvested now is really for the mid-crop (from May).""
Port forwarders' figures seen by Reuters showed 1996/97 cocoa volumes handled 12 percent down on 1995/96, but managers said warehouse stocks for end-April shipment would close the gap.
""It is very acceptable. We thought the gap could be twice that,"" said a manager for SAGA, San Pedro's largest forwarder. ""Last year, arrivals figures were a lot more available so it has been harder to track.""
Cocoa bean shipments rose from 39,637 tonnes in February to 51,981 in March and at least another 10,000 tonnes was due to leave next week.
""Some of what is left in stores will be for local processors (using around 135,000 tonnes of beans a year),"" said one crop analyst.
SACO, San Pedro's only factory, had large volumes of produce stored in sheds with bagged cocoa under external awnings. Cocoa product exports totalled around 4,000 tonnes for February and March.
Several new warehouses are planned to increase port cocoa storage capacity. New factories are also in the pipeline.
Exporters are now looking forward to pod counters' mid-crop predictions, expected this month, and further news on Ivory Coast's intention to destroy illegal cocoa plantations in classified forest areas.
The country's Minister for Commodities, Guy-Alain Gauze, said earlier on Friday in the Netherlands that the upcoming mid-crop would be somewhere near 100,000 tonnes.
"
18,"Ivory Coast 1996/97 cocoa marketing season began on Thursday with the farm-gate price unchanged, the export tax lower, but confusion over freight rates.
Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan told a news conference late on Wednesday that the farm-gate price would remain at 320 CFA francs per bagged kilo.  
Kouassi Konan, whose comments were broadcast on Ivorian state television on Thursday, said the Droit Unique de Sortie (DUS) export tax would be cut from 160 CFA francs to 150.
""To maintain the price, the government itself had to agree to a sacrifice of about 10 billion CFA francs, through the lowering of the Driot Unique de Sorti for cocoa,"" he said.
""If we had not made this cut we would have had to touch the price. The head of state insisted that the price of 320 CFA be maintained for our producers.""
Exporters had been expecting no significant price change.
Shipowners spoke of disagreements with officials over an indicative freight rate for 1996/97.
The Office Ivoirien de Chargeurs had requested detailed information on proposed freight rates on shipments for 1996/97, they said.
""We cannot give that kind of information now that markets have been liberalised. This is a part of our business strategy,"" one said.
""Normally (the Ivorian shipping industry forum) FEDERMAR would organise a meeting to discuss matters but we have been waiting.""
Kouassi Konan said the government had approved on Wednesday without amendment a decision taken by the Caisse de Stabilisation marketing board on the campaign.
Noting that the 1995/96 campaign was ending on Wednesday, he added, ""As a result, remaining stocks must be declared to the Caistab.""  
The opening of the season had been delayed by about three weeks. The government had given no explanation but some exporters linked the delay to the appointment only last month of new Caistab head Yves-Marie Koissy.
Koissy, who previously worked for the International Monetary Fund in Washington, has formally taken over but is not expected back in Ivory Coast until mid-November.
The 1995/96 season produced a record of around 1.2 million tonnes but a dispute over shipping rates blocked exports from early October to mid-November.
Export financers say bank liquidity was good with interest rates down on last year after Ivory Coast repaid some external debt.
""When exporters present their licences and backing contracts we can go ahead. Export licensing should be no problem,"" said an international banker.
Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze, speaking on the sidelines of a two-day ministerial review in Gabon of the 1993 International Cocoa Agreement, said on Monday that Ivory Coast's 1996/97 cocoa production would be between 900,000 and 950,000 tonnes.

18,"Bulk cocoa shipments from West Africa will more than double to 325,000 tonnes in 1996/97, solidifying a cost-cutting trend sparked by recent trial shipments, exporters and shippers said.
""West African shipments will reach at least 325,000 tonnes this year (1996/97),"" said one trader, with most going to large Amsterdam-based buyers. ""And that is only a start."" he added.
Bulk shipments include beans stuffed directly into containers or poured loose into ship's holds, replacing traditional stacks of 60 kg jute bags.
Ivory Coast would ship about 270,000 tonnes in bulk this year. The world's largest producer blazed the trail by shipping 120,000 tonnes in 1995/96 as bagged cocoa lost favour with large buyers, said the source.
Of this year's total, about 260,000 tonnes would be shipped for two Amsterdam-based clients out of an expected crop of 900,000 to one million tonnes, said the trader.
Less than half, about 120,000 tonnes, would be shipped loose on holds against the same tonnage for all forms of bulk shipments in 1995/96. The remainder would be leave in twenty-foot bag-lined containers packed with drying agents.
Additional shipments of about 5,000 tonnes for trials to Germany, and less for Mediterranean ports would take the total of both bulk methods to around 270,000 tonnes.
Ghana is also expected to build on small shipments with 25,000 tonnes possibly leaving in December. Volumes from Nigeria and Cameroun are widely expected to rise.
Little was shipped in bulk from other West African ports last year but shipping companies say that will change.
Dutch transporters Spliethoffe completed three successful trials from Ivory Coast in 1995/96 totalling about 10,000 tonnes followed by another 110,000 tonnes for processors Gerkens and Cacao De Zaan.
The loading and shipment methods developed then has prompted an expected 100 percent plus jump in overall regional tonnages for 1996/97, say shippers.
Shipping lines Nedlloyd, Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) and Delmas (SDV) are already taking bulk cargos from forwarders SAGA and Delmas, and Ivorian exporters/forwarders Jean-Abile Gal and SIFCA.
""Each have loading systems (total of 8) in Abidjan and San Pedro (Ivory Coast's second port) but only direct users have reception facilities,"" a West Africa region shipping manager said. ""Not everyone has a 4,000 tonnes a day capacity plant with storage facilities,"" he added, referring to large processors in Amsterdam.
""In future, about  25 percent of all cocoa will leave in bulk,"" said one shipping manager, depending on the size of the reference crop
The manager of another shipper handling large volumes put the figure at 40 percent by 2000 for Ivory Coast.
""The economics are simple. What used to be shipped in four containers is now shipped in three,"" he said, or 100 tonees per six 20 foot containers.
Shipping companies had gained a 25 percent freight space saving and exporters would expect rebates in return, he said.
A typical charter on FIOS (free in and out, stowed) rates would be 55 dollars, with another 25 dollars in handling to be added depending on terms, said one shipping line.
The marginal cost of loading a container was about 3,750 CFA a tonne with 55,000 CFA for positioning a container, but labour and time savings more than compensated. Conveyor belts, silos and tip-up containers are all used for loading.
Plans to build a new bulk reception warehouse in Amsterdam unveiled by Dutch Cocoa Association (NCV) president Louis Bensdorp on Friday would encourage bulk cocoa advocates, said local exporters.

18,"African coffee ministers meet on Thursday to discuss cutting robusta exports following a January agreement among world producers, but some officials say disease and drought make cuts unnecessary in some countries.
African producers agreed after a January meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to cut robusta exports by a total of 850,000 60-kilo bags between January and June 1997 in an attempt to force up prices.
Individual country quotas were left to be decided later.
""We shall be looking into the export programme in light of the Rio (de Janeiro) agreement and our objective is to ensure a transparent and effective implementation,"" said a spokesman for the Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO).
""The ministers will take a decision on how to allocate the share which falls on Africa and how to deal with shortfalls,"" said IACO chief economist Donald Kaberuka. ""We will also discuss the issue of non-member countries.""
Eight countries will take part in the talks -- Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Kenya, Zaire, Tanzania, Madagascar and Ethiopia.
Quotas for individual countries set at the meeting would not be made public.
""Some people have said we will not make any cuts but that is not true,"" said Kaberuka.
A Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) official said this week that drought and disease had cut into that country's exports, making quotas unnecessary.
Uganda is Africa's largest robusta producer.
It produced around 4,644,397 60-kilo bags in 1996 against 3,079,261 in 1995, according to IACO. Ivory Coast produced 2,526,198 and 2,493,754 over the same periods.
Analysts in Ivory Coast say bean quality problems could mean no more than 130,000-150,000 tonnes will be exported in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) despite an official forecast of 230,000 tonnes.
Ivorian exports by the end of January totalled little more than 24,000 tonnes. The season opened on November 14.
The Coffee Board of Kenya, also citing drought and disease, has forecast a drop in production and earnings this year.
Zaire's production has been cut by the conflict there since late 1996.

18,"The Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) will focus on low world prices at its 1996/97 coffee season annual meeting in Abidjan on November 17-19, IACO's chief economist said on Friday.
""In spite of a world export programme the indicative robusta price is only at 73 cents per pound. This is too low,"" chief economist Donald Kaberuka told Reuters on Friday.
""We do not aim to set a target price but today's composite price for robusta and arabica, 99.29 cents, is also low,"" he said. ""Any recommendations will be sent to the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC).""
Last May the ACPC, which represents 80 percent of world production, agreed to limit green coffee exports from its 14 members to 53.5 million 60-kg bags in the year to June 1997 after 48.9 million in 95/96.
Africa's total 1996/97 export allocation under the ACPC plan is 12,840,000 bags, or 24 percent of total ACPC target.
The 25-member group of African IACO exporters were very concerned by persistent low prices on the world markets despite a producer plan to limit exports, Kaberuka said in an interview.
""The market could be in balance this year as there is only a small production surplus. We are perplexed by the low prices and want the plan to have an impact,"" he added.
Kaberuka, who is in charge of ACPC target management for IACO, said IACO provisions allowed a review of the export plan after six months, meaning December.
IACO's 25 members would study the situation and then decide if action was needed. Full agenda details are not yet available.
IACO last met in Gabon in November 1995 to review volatile world markets, coffee rehabilitation plans and financing deals for exporters.
This time last year the world export plan aimed to stabilise market prices at 135 cents/lb for robusta and 165 cents for arabica. Prices then were 114 and 128 cents respectively.
The current export targets were set at the May ACPC review of the export plan, now in its second year (July 96-June 97). In 1995/96 the ACPC set total world exports at 60.4 million bags, including non-ACPC producers. --Abidjan Newsroom + 225 21 21 90

23,"If the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System does as expected early Friday and votes to expand banks' non-banking activities, it will only heighten the drive in Congress to overhaul U.S. banking regulations completely, analysts and industry officials said.
The Fed is expected to vote to allow banks' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities such as securities underwriting, up from the current 10 percent ceiling.  
The section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has stolen some of the Fed's thunder. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses.
Both the Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  
In the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance or underwriting stock deals. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock.
""Now the tables have been turned,"" Litan said. ""But it's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field.""  
Both moves also reflect current market realities. The financial services industry, from banks to insurance companies to mutual funds, is converging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks.
In the words of one top regulator, the Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent, ""is not material."" The Fed has required banks to take certain steps to prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, and its government-insured deposits.
Competitors in other fields fret that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields.
Comptroller Ludwig disagreed. Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech here Thursday, Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary ""basically eliminates any subsidization.""
He opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. ""It's a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace,"" he said.

23,"Legislators introduced two bills Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration's export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications.
Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" were once the realm of spies and generals.
But with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business's e-mail confidential to protecting a consumer's credit card number if it is transmitted online.
Senators said export restrictions on encryption products were hindering the development of the Internet and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete with foreign firms.
The bills ""roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers,"" Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
""Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations,"" said Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican , also a co-sponsor.
The bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy and Burns introduced similiar measures in the last Congress.
Under the current Clinton administration policy, a company may export strong encryption only if the product also includes a feature to allow the U.S. government to crack the code by recovering the software ""key"" when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration says it must be able to crack the codes to catch international criminals and terrorists.
If the bills became law, mandatory key recovery would be banned but the government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats.
The legislation would also write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption -- but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice.
The Clinton administration signalled its displeasure with the new bills.
""We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety,"" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. ""We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data.""
Computer companies and privacy advocates hailed the bills.
""Both bills promote the freedom of this nation's fastest-growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand,"" said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance. The group includes Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development and Apple Computer Inc., among others.
""This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today,"" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology.
Berman, who strongly opposes mandatory key recovery, said the policy ought to be ""my lock, my key.""

23,"A computer scientist barred from exporting a floppy disk containing computer encryption programming asked a federal court Friday to strike down the export limits as a violation of his right to free speech.
Philip Karn challenged the rules after the State Department in 1994 denied his request to export the programming on disk but allowed him to export the identical material contained in a book.
U.S. law treats many kinds of encryption, computer coding and decoding programs, under the same category as munitions.  
The Clinton administration recently issued new rules relaxing the export limits, but most existing encryption programs remain classified as munitions and are subject to strict export limits.
The limits infringed on Karn's constitutional rights to free speech and due process, his attorney, Kenneth Bass, told a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Friday.
The First Amendment of the Constitution ought to apply equally to computer code written in a book or saved in text form on a floppy disk, Bass argued.  
""It just cannot be that the Constitution doesn't recognize progress,"" Bass said.
Karn did not attempt to export ""object"" computer code, a working program that could be run on a computer to encrypt and decrypt data. Karn's disk contained ""source"" code, or directions that could be used to write such software.
In another case, Federal district court Judge Marilyn Patel held last month that source code should be considered a protected form of speech. But the ruling, in the Northern District of California, is not binding on the D.C. Appeals court.

23,"An influential global research group is preparing guidelines on encryption policy for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft of the report obtained by Reuters.
The Clinton administration, seeking to rally support at home and abroad for its controversial encryption export policy, got some discussion of its approach in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines but not an endorsement.  
On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favor or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programs provide a means for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.
After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft states ""this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful access.""  
On all the controversial areas in the draft, ""the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide,"" said John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, in a telephone interview from Paris.
Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a means to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden observed.
But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch criminals and global terrorists, he said.  
The guidelines suggest that encryption users should have ""access to cryptography that meets their needs.""  Government controls should be ""no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities.""
Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and possible approaches.
""It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not a attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt,"" Dryden said.  
The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be ""determined by the market in an open and competitive environment.""
""There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs,"" Dryden said.
U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised its approach.  ""They're an important and helpful step forward,"" Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.  
""They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this,"" he added
Reinsch maintained that most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement.  Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.
The draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by the top-level OECD council.  
The council is composed of ambassadors from the 29 member countries.
U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the OECD draft.
""This is not helpful,"" Netscape Communications Corp's public policy counsel Peter Harter said.  Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free market policies, he said.

23,"Congress revives the debate over encryption export policy this week but much has changed since last year's tussles.
Once the domain of spies and generals, encryption has become a critical component of electronic commerce and global communications on the Internet.
This year, the Clinton administration has a new policy in place allowing freer export of encryption products, which are programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key.""
The new Clinton policy, enacted through executive order in November and in effect since January 1, allows export of stronger encryption than previously allowed. But it requires companies to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to crack the codes by getting access to the software keys.
The government says it needs the ability to crack strong encryption to catch criminals and terrorists.
While a few companies, most notably International Business Machines, have obtained export licenses under the new policy, most high-tech companies remain frustrated.
They want to be able to export very strong encryption without including the government access features.
Privacy advocates also oppose the current Clinton policy, which they say puts too much power in the hands of government.
Since the government does not require guaranteed access to the keys to one's home, it should not be given such access to the keys to one's data, they argue. ""My lock, my key,"" is the slogan on their buttons this week.
In congress, the passage of time has crystallised the issue for many members and both sides in the debate have found new allies. Last year, most lawmakers seemed either in favour of relaxed export restrictions or undecided.
The full Senate Commerce Committee will hear testimony Wednesday on two bills introduced in the Senate to remove almost all export restrictions, and Thursday, the House Judiciary subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property will debate a similiar bill under consideration there.
At the House encryption hearing, Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch, deputy director of the National Security Agency William Crowell and a member of the Department of Justice criminal division, will defend the Clinton policy.
The Senate will also hear from FBI director Louis Freeh and special encryption envoy David Aaron.
Industry representatives at the hearings will include officials from Netscape Communications Corp., one of the most vocal administration critics, and Microsoft Corp.
Privacy advocates will testify in the House, including Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology, and Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Centre.

23,"The U.S. Commerce Department showed an unexpected degree of flexibility in approving an application from Sybase Inc to export computer encoding products, company officials said on Wednesday.
About a dozen companies have already gotten permission this year to export products with encryption, data scrambling technology that renders information unreadable without a password or software ""key.""
But Sybase's products appeared to skirt strict U.S. export rules in effect since the beginning of the year.  
""I was sufficiently surprised when I got word over the phone that we had been approved that I wrote a letter spelling out what I saw as the differences of our approach versus (the regulations),"" said Tom Parenty, Sybase's director of data and communication security. Shortly thereafter, Parenty said, he received written confirmation.
To export powerful encryption under the current rules, a company must include features allowing the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys. Companies may export medium-strength encryption by promising to include so-called key recovery features within two years.  
The rules indicate that a product must allow key recovery both for encrypted stored data, like a file on a hard drive, as well as for live communications that are encoded.
But Sybase's products, Internet transaction software and client-server database programs, will allow for key recovery within two years only of stored data. Encrypted communications between a customer and a web site using the Sybase transaction software, for example, would not allow for government decoding, Parenty said.
The key recovery feature was designed to meet the needs of customers, he said.  
""Many people want a key recovery mechanism for stored data,"" Parenty said. ""But there is no reason, once I have the answer to my query, to want the keys to decrypt those communications.""
Sybase still supports legislative proposals that Congress is considering that would eliminate most of the export restrictions, Parenty said.
The Clinton administration has opposed loosening the rules, but pressure for change continued to mount this week, as Sun Microsystems Inc announced it would get around the rules by marketing Russian-made encryption with its export products.
And on Wednesday, a group of cryptography experts released a study concluding that the large-scale infrastructure needed to support key recovery for law enforcement agencies could compromise the security of lawful encryption users.

23,"A leading software industry group is backing away from its early support of the Clinton Administration's new policy to ease export rules on computer encoding technology.
In a letter to vice president Al Gore, the Business Software Alliance, which includes Microsoft Corp and International Business Machine Corp's Lotus Development, warned that rules implementing the new encryption export policy appeared to be flawed.  
""It appears that significant backtracking has occurred since the October 1 announcement,"" the alliance wrote.
""Therefore, we seriously doubt that the regulations will work, meet consumer demands or be accepted by the private sector unless the administration radically changes its approach immediately,"" the alliance added.
A spokeswoman for Gore said Greg Simon, the vice president's chief domestic policy adviser, and other administration officials working on the rules have met with the software group to discuss the criticism.  
""There is still an internal decision making process going on,"" spokeswoman Heidi Kukis said. Final rules are expected by January 1, she said.
The administration is attempting to craft a compromise on export sales of products containing encryption, computer programs that use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key.""
Under current laws dating from the Cold War, products for export can only include very weak coding features.  
But with the growth of the Internet and online commerce, encryption is spreading as a means to ensure secure communication between businesses and to safeguard consumers' credit card numbers.
U.S. software companies argue they are losing substantial overseas sales to foreign companies not bound by the export laws.
U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials counter that the spread of sophisticated encryption will make their jobs far more difficult.  
Under the compromise policy announced in October and enacted in an executive order last month, companies would be able to export strong encryption but only if the products also contained a feature known as ""key recovery"" that would permit the government to decode scrambled data.
The software alliance said in October that the new policy was a ""step in the right direction."" In its letter this week, however, the alliance said it was not happy with the rules being drafted to implement the policy. ""Everything we have seen and heard to date reveals that the government is headed in the absolute wrong direction,"" it said.  
Part of the debate revolves around the definition of key recovery. The alliance said key recovery should consist of products which allow the government to decode stored communications, such as an E-mail message saved on a computer hard drive. But products should not be required to allow government decoding of real-time communications.
""There is little if any commercial demand for key recovery function in real-time communications,"" the alliance wrote. ""Our members have seen nothing to suggest that any product developed to date can work on a mass market scale or that there is significant commercial demand for such products.""
A number of companies, including Microsoft and IBM, have announced products designed to meet the new export policy. But not all of them easily allow real-time key recovery.
Although Microsoft is trying to create products to meet the export policy, ""we still feel government should liberalize the policy more,"" John Browne, head of the company's Internet commerce group, said.

Company representatives met Tuesday night at the Capitol with members of the Congressional Internet Caucus, about 85 legislators with a common interest in the Net, to express their hopes and fears about efforts to make laws governing cyberspace.
""I think it's inevitable that there will be bills introduced that attempt to legislate the content of everything on the Internet,"" Tom Evslin, vice president of AT&amp;T Corp.'s WorldNet Internet service, said after the meeting.
Evslin said it would be as difficult to keep Congress from making wrong moves as it would be to get the legislature to act to head off problems.
Bill Schrader, president of Internet provider PSINet Inc., was more blunt. ""Be very careful or you will destroy this industry,"" he warned.
The members of Congress who attended the meeting pledged to try to protect the Internet.
""We have a lot of pretty tough work ahead of us,"" Rep. Rick White, R-Pa., and a co-chairman of the caucus conceded. ""We have many, many issues coming down the pike from encryption to privacy, to copyright and taxation.""
Encyrption is the use of software to encode and decode information.
Sen. Conrad Burns, also a co-chairman, warned that, despite the caucus, legislation will always trail developments in the private sector.
""The government making policy is never ahead of the curve,"" the Montana Republican said. ""If we do the right thing now, I guarantee you that by the time it's passed and the president signs it, we'll be behind the curve.""
Last year was a mixed bag for the Internet in Congress.
Legislators passed the Communications Decency Act, opposed by online companies and civil libertarians as an infringement on free speech rights, but also defeated measures that would have imposed liability on Internet providers for copyright infringement.

Companies interested in the Internet offered some conflicting goals for Congress. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, urged the legislators to impose new laws protecting Hollywood products.
""Congress cannot avoid that all intellectual property has to be protected -- this can't be Dodge City without a sheriff,"" Valenti said. But he also praised the Internet as ""the most valuable and spacious information greenhouse that's ever been built.""

23,"The growing business of doing business on the Internet poses a major challenge to tax collectors, but no special taxes should be imposed in cyberspace, the government said in report released Thursday.
""Treasury believes that these new technologies should not be used to justify new taxes,"" the Treasury Department draft report said. ""Accordingly, Treasury is not considering any type of value added tax, 'bit tax,' or other new excise tax on electronic commerce.""
Instead, the current system should evolve to tax income from all sources in a consistent manner, the department said.
""Our overall tax policy goal in this area should emulate policy in other areas -- maintain neutrality, fairness and simplicity -- a policy which serves to encourage all desirable economic activity new and old,"" the report said.
Businesses are already struggling with tax proposals from state and local governments, according to Kent Johnson, head of sales and transaction tax practice at KPMG Peat Marwick.
""State governments don't feel the same way as the federal government, but this report may be a good starting point for discussing all the issues,"" Johnson said.
This year, about $1 billion of goods and services will be sold online, growing to over $7 billion by the year 2000, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.
But the myriad tax laws and regulations affecting businesses may not keep pace with the fast-paced, often chaotic growth of the worldwide computer network.
Buyers and sellers on the Internet can be in different states or even different countries, complicating the task of collecting tax at the ""source"" of a transaction.
The department also said it was worried that tax evaders could use the anonymity provided by the Internet as a mask to avoid reporting income or to transfer money to offshore bank accounts.
But the report made no recommendations about how the government should deal with tax evasion issues. ""Treasury intends to study, and requests comments on these issues,"" the report said.
The report is available on the Treasury's web site, http://www.ustreas.gov.
The report on taxation is likely to be followed by reports on other aspects of online commerce that the department is studying, including consumer protection, electronic money, bank regulation and law enforcement, officials said.

4,"National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators were preparing to examine the wreckage on Friday of a Delta Comair plane that crashed in a snowstorm on Thursday, killing all 29 people on board.
The commuter plane, an Embraer Brasilia 120 en route to Detroit from Cincinnati, crashed in Raisinville Township about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Detroit.
NTSB officials arrived in Michigan on Thursday and immediately set up a command post in Ann Arbor, which is near the site of the crash. The wreckage was brought together under a tarpaulin to protect it from snow and was being guarded until the probe began.
Investigators met early on Friday to plan strategy for the probe and were expected to begin combing the mangled wreckage later in the day.
Cincinnati-based Comair, an independent carrier that flies commuter routes for Delta, said the 30-seat plane was carrying 26 passengers and three crew members.
The three Cincinnati-based crew members were Captain Dann Carlsen, First Officer Kenneth Reece and Flight Attendant Darinda Ogden, Comair said in a statement early on Friday.
The airline sent 30 members of its emergency response team to Michigan on Thursday, according to David Siebenburgen, President of Comair.
""They are there to assist the families, the NTSB and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in any way they can during this ordeal,"" Siebenburgen said.
A news conference was scheduled by the airline for 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT)  at Cincinnati airport in Erlanger, Ky.
Flight 3272 had been cleared for approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport when air traffic controllers lost radar contact, Comair Senior Vice President of Marketing Charles Curran told a news briefing on Thursday. No distress signals were sent, he said.
Comair said the plane has been with the company since February 1992 and had its most recent maintenance checkup on Nov. 20, 1996. The airline denied an earlier report the plane had been grounded two days earlier for rudder problems.
Witnesses told local television crews the plane's engines made a sputtering sound before it crashed into the ground at a sharp angle. The plane exploded into a fireball that sent a black mushroom cloud into the air that left ""just pieces"" of the twin-prop airliner.
The area and much of the region had been hit by a storm which dumped six inches (15 cm) or more of snow. While air traffic was snarled in Chicago and other cities there was no confirmation that weather played a role in the crash.
In October 1994 icing caused a French-built American Eagle ATR-72 to crash in northern Indiana, killing all 68 on board. The plane's manufacturer later made revisions to de-icing equipment.
CNN reported that the Brazilian-made Embraer-120 has been involved in 13 other crashes since 1986 where lives were lost, including an accident in Georgia that killed former Senator John Tower.

4,"Although General Motors Corp and the United Auto Workers are separated by crucial outsourcing issues, analysts said Monday they do not foresee the union staging a protracted strike against GM.
""I don't think there's any will to have some major explosion,"" said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Center for the Study of Automotive Transportation.
""They've been close for some time,"" he said.  
David Healy, analyst at Burnham Securites Inc, said the union could still hit GM with ""Apache raids"" that target individual plants that make high-profit vehicles, however.
Talks for a new three-year labor deal were to resume Tuesday about 8:30 a.m. EST/1330 GMT. Bargainers worked for 17 hours into the early morning Monday before calling a recess, even though a contract extension deadine expired at midnight Sunday.
UAW President Stephen Yokich said earlier Monday he plans to settle the union's differences with the company at the bargaining table, and not resort to selective strikes at profitable light truck plants, as had been speculated Sunday.
The UAW represents 215,000 members at GM, more than half of the 390,000 UAW workers who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers.
Union members had made up picket signs and drafted strike schedules Sunday night in the event they got the word to walk off the job. On Monday, one local union official said members were comfortable working without a contract.
""People understand that things have got to be done the way the negotiators do it,"" said Ken Summers, administrative assistant to the chairman of Local 594 in Pontiac, Michigan. ""Nobody wants a strike.""
Summers said Local 594, where members make the popular full-size C/K pickup trucks, has ""serious"" issues with GM over outsourcing, as well as health and safety issues.
Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California at Berkeley, said it's possible local disputes will inger even after a national agreement is reached, like they did following the 1993 contract talks.
""Although my sense is if GM gets a pact similar to Ford and Chrysler, which I think is the odds-on favorite, we will see many of the local disputes wrap up relatively quickly,"" he said.
Yokich said he intends to return to GM's headquarters for more talks Tuesday. GM Chairman Jack Smith, who was present for some of the talks late Sunday, is scheduled to appear in New York at a morning news conference with Hazel O'Leary, secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, on renewable energy issues.
A GM spokeswoman could not be reached to determine if Smith still plans to attend the event.

4,"The engines have been started in the race to succeed Alex Trotman for the top office at Ford Motor Co.
The company Thursday promoted two long-time Ford executives into positions that will allow them to prove if they are worthy of occupying one or more top spots at Detroit's No. 2 automaker.
Edward Hagenlocker, 56, was promoted to vice chairman from executive vice president, and put in charge of a new auto components organisation with 75,000 employees and revenues of $14 billion.
Jacques Nasser, 48, previously the group vice president in charge of product development, was named to Hagenlocker's old job of heading up Ford Automotive Operations, the company's core car and truck business.
Speculation has swirled for months about how Ford's board of directors plans to handle the succession of Trotman, who currenly holds the titles of chairman, chief executive officer and president. Trotman reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65 in July of 1998, but the board can ask him to stay on.
Complicating matters is the prospect of a Ford family member returning to a top officer's role for the first time since 1980.
Recent reports have said William Clay Ford Jr., 39, a great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, could be named a non-executive chairman, or chairman, when Trotman leaves.
Because Hagenlocker's nearly three-year tenure at Ford Automotive Operations has been marred by slumping profits and a slow start for the redesigned Taurus, some outsiders have said his chances for higher office have dimmed.
But Hagenlocker, a reserved man who joined the company in 1964 as a research scientist, has also overseen the launch of the hugely successful new F-Series pickup trucks, as well as the new Ford Expedition full-size sport utility, which is expected to be both popular and profitable.
Eugene Jennings, a retired professor of management at Michigan State University, said Hagenlocker's being put in charge of the new parts organisation could turn into a high-profile spot that should not be read as a demotion.
""It's the one thing that Hagenlocker needs under his belt to give him the experience he needs to run the company,"" said Jennings, a long-time Big Three observer.
Nasser has been at Ford nearly as long as Hagenlocker. Born in Lebanon but raised in Australia, Nasser first joined the company in 1968 as a financial analyst. He rose through several international assignments, earning a reputation as a ""no-nonsense petrol head.""
While Hagenlocker is stiff in front of the media, Nasser moves easily among reporters, entertaining them with colourful stories about cricket and his globe-trotting life abroad.
Wesley Brown, of industry consultant CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich., said Nasser's new role also offers him a chance to further demonstrate his abilities at running the company.
""It clearly puts Nasser in a position to take over from Trotman when he retires,"" said Brown.
For his part, Trotman was circumspect about the succession question. At a news briefing Thursday, he was asked if the board is actively working on the issue.
Trotman responded, ""Absolutely. In depth, and frequently -- and has been for the last 20 or 30 years.""

4,"A commuter plane heading for Detroit in a heavy snowstorm crashed in a remote wooded area south of the city on Thursday, killing all 30 on board, officials said.
The Embraer-120, operated as flight 3272 by Comair, a regional carrier based in Cincinnati, crashed at 3:50 p.m. EST (2050 GMT) near the town of Ida about 25 miles (40 km) from Detroit near the Raisin River.
Comair operates as a feeder for Delta Airlines.
A nearby resident, Thomas Marino, said he heard the plane flying low overhead while shoveling snow off his driveway.
""I heard a jet flying very low. Then a loud boom, a vibration. I didn't see the fireball,"" he told Reuters. ""It sounded low, but planes fly low all the time over here, especially when it's overcast.""
Much of the region had been hit by a storm which dumped a half foot (15 cm) or more of snow. There was no confirmation, however, that weather played a role in the crash.
Marino said he drove one-half mile (0.8 km) to the crash site, but could only see smoke and rescue workers swarming around.
He said the plane crashed into what looked like a farm field, just south of the Raisin River.
Television film footage showed only a blackened gash in a snowy field.
The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said the plane carried 25 passengers, two pilots and three flight attendants and that none survived.
The flight originated in Cincinnati.
One man who lived near the crash site told a Detroit radio station there was an ""unbelievable"" explosion and fireball when the plane crashed.
Any plane carrying 70 or less is considered a commuter flight though some routinely operate under the same safety and flight rules that govern larger aircraft.
In October 1994, icing caused a French-built American Eagle ATR-72 to crash in northern Indiana, killing all 68 on board. The plane's manufacturer later made revisions to de-icing equipment.

4,"Ford Motor Co's long-shot bid to sit down first with the United Auto Workers union paid off, but analysts wondered Wednesday what the automaker had to give up in exchange for being the Big Three's lead-off negotiator.
""Everyone wants to be first, and that's obviously a plus for Ford in that regard,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst David Bradley. ""The question is, what price did they have to pay to be first?""  
Since January, analysts and other auto industry observers believed Chrysler Corp would be the UAW's choice to start contract talks, although last month some thought General Motors Corp had a good shot.
Union officials acknowledged Tuesday that Ford was selected, but they declined to comment beyond that. Ford executives also declined to comment other than to say the automaker is ""encouraged"" by the tone of the talks.
Analysts speculated Ford may have expressed some willingness to help union organizing efforts among its supply base.  
That would address job security issues that are crucial to the UAW as the union faces a shrinking membership base.
In return, the union may have agreed to consider a contract that spans more than the traditional three years.
""I think (Ford) would love to have a five or six year agreement,"" said Michael Ward, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. ""It strengthens Ford's position with the UAW.""
A big unknown is how willing Ford is to limit the number of components it buys from outside suppliers, a process known as outsourcing.  
But James Harbour, president of Troy, Mich.-based industry consultant Harbour and Associates Inc, said Ford does not have the breadth of engineering talent to bring large numbers of parts in-house.
""I think probably the biggest thing they could give them is to say we'll work with suppliers and ask them to join the union,"" said Harbour.  ""Membership is the issue this year.""
Not being the lead-off company has in the past been bad news for the two automakers not selected because of the pattern style of bargaining that imposed terms on them.
But analysts said that is not necessarily the case this time.  
Unlike prior years, negotiations are continuing with GM and Chrysler.  And there are signs the traditional pattern process is no longer as firm as it used to be.
Bradley noted that by holding out, GM has also not lost any negotiating power. ""For now, GM is powder-dry.  They haven't given up any leverage, which they would have had to do to be first,"" he said.
In picking Ford, which employs about 104,000 UAW members, the union starts with a company that is recognized as having the best labor relations among the Detroit's Big Three.
Analysts said the relative labor peace has given Ford better work rules and allows it more flexibility to use overtime to increase production.  It also has spared the company costly strikes that have hit GM and Chrysler.
The downside, according to Wall Street analysts, is that Ford has not been as aggressive in farming out work to less expensive outside suppliers -- something GM is focusing on.

4,"Ford Motor Co. on Friday became the second of the U.S. Big Three automakers to align itself with the emerging auto superstore trend by announcing a new agreement with Republic Industries Inc., the parent company of AutoNation USA.
Under the agreement, AutoNation can submit proposals to acquire existing Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealerships. The pact also covers areas Ford may want a dealership where it does not currently have one.
The move could have implications for the future of Ohio-based Mullinax Management, one of the largest dealer groups in the country, which is reported to be in merger talks with AutoNation.
Ford spokesman John Ochs said Ford has not sold any dealerships to AutoNation. A spokesman for Mullinax, based in Amherst, Ohio, could not be reached for comment.
Mullinax, which owns several large Ford dealerships, was the 11th largest dealer group in the country, based on its 1995 retail unit sales of 20,374 cars and trucks, according to industry trade publication Automotive News.
Last month, published reports began to surface on talks between Mullinax and AutoNation. The growing auto superstore chain was founded by Wayne Huizenga, who transformed Blockbuster Video into a multibillion-dollar business and owns the Miami Dolphins professional football team.
Ford's deal with Republic is a ""framework agreement"" that opens the door for AutoNation to submit individual proposals, Ochs said. In a statement, Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said the automaker believed private entrepreneurs with local community ties will continue to be the ""backbone"" of its franchise system.
""However, there will continue to be developments in the industry relating to other types of dealership ownership and distribution methods,"" he said. ""We are working diligently to ensure that the new operators fit into our franchise system.""
That is a change from last February, when Ford Chairman Alex Trotman told the National Automotible Dealers Association it had no plans to offer a new-car franchise to an auto superstore.
A year ago, Chrysler Corp. announced it would grant a new-car franchise to CarMax Auto Superstore in Norcross, Ga. CarMax is owned by consumer electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc..
The move sent a shockwave through the traditional auto dealer industry, which had already been warily watching the growth of chains such as CarMax and AutoNation in the used-car segment of the business.
The new superstores quickly have become popular with consumers because they offer large numbers of newer used cars at haggle-free prices in a pressure-free environment.
The Ford announcement signals the superstores will continue to build a presence in the new-car business, analysts said. ""That's big news,"" said William Sawyer, vice president of sales in the Detroit office of Polk, a marketing research firm. ""It's definitely a change for Ford.""
The move is also noteworthy, he said, because Ford has traditionally been opposed to publicly traded companies owning its franchises.
General Motors Corp. is the last of the Big Three to not have any franchise agreements with an auto superstore. GM spokesman Edward Lechtzin said the automaker was not opposed to the concept and has held talks with those groups in the past.
""We've held discussions. We'll continue to hold discussions. If one of them wants to purchase a GM dealership, we'll review it,"" he said.

4,"If Miss Manners, the nation's arbiter of proper taste and decorum, can find good things to say about car dealers, then the industry must be doing something right.
That was the message John Peterson, outgoing president of the National Automobile Dealers Association, delivered on Saturday in a speech that railed against the media and others who say traditional car dealerships are on the way out.
""It's time we stood up for what our industry is doing right out there,"" said Peterson. ""So, to our friends in the media, I say take a tip from one of your own, Miss Manners, and park that old stereotype of fast-talking salesmen in plaid coats and white bucks.""
According to Peterson, Miss Manners, whose real name is Judith Martin, wrote a column in 1996 after she shopped for a new car in which she said she was ""astonished"" at the ""dignified courtesy"" she found at a dozen dealerships she visted.
Peterson spoke at the opening day of the NADA's 80th annual convention and equipment exposition.
In his remarks, Peterson acknowledged the traditional dealer franchise system is facing numerous challenges from the explosive growth of used car superstores such as CarMax and AutoNation USA.
But he said traditional franchised dealers will remain the dominant system for selling new cars and trucks. In a year when the superstores grew rapidly, Peterson said franchised dealers boosted sales by three percent, increased profits by 25 percent, and finished the year with 23,000 dealerships in operation.
Of the approximately 15 million new light vehicles expected to be sold in 1997, 14.5 million will be sold by the current franchise system.
Peterson also took issue with critics who say car dealers do not respond to customers, saying a recent survey by the Newspaper Association of America indicated that more than 90 percent of new-vehicle buyers are satisified or very satisfied.
""No business is more poked at, picked at, anaylzed, written about and castigated for failing to live up to performance standards that no other business in the country is expected to meet,"" said Peterson.
In the NADA's keynote speech, Toyota Motor Corp's top executive in the U.S. told the audience that franchised new-car dealers will continue to be the cornerstone of the U.S. automotive retailing industry.
Yale Gieszel, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc, said consumers -- and not auto superstores -- are driving the changes rocking the business.
""Large retail chains or automobile department stores are not the answer to the challenges we face. The current franchise system will not only survive, it will flourish,"" he said.
At a news conference afterward, Gieszel said he does not believe the large superstore chains can reap enough economies of scale that they can outperform local franchises. Gieszel also said Toyota is not convinced the large superstores can offer the close customer attention that individual dealers can.

4,"CMS Energy Co should have no trouble meeting or exceeding the $2.40 to $2.45 a share earnings estimates that analysts forecast for all of 1996, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William McCormick said Friday.
""We feel very comfortable we'll be at or above that range,"" he said in a telephone interview from the utility's Dearborn, Mich. headquarters. CMS, the parent company for Consumers Power Co, Michigan's largest utility, earned $2.27 a share on total revenues of $3.9 billion in 1995.  
Earlier Friday, CMS announced the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a settlement that removes the final rate uncertainty of its Midland Cogeneration Venture L.P., ending a 10-year regulatory saga involving the embattled plant.
The settlement allows Consumers Power to include the cost of buying the final 325 megawatts of power from the plant in its customer rates. Previously, CMS was granted permission to include in rates the cost of buying 915 megawatts of the plant's total 1240 megawatts of power.  
""The last significant uncertainty related to the whole Midland situation was the recovery of the remaining 325 megawatts,"" said McCormick, who added he has been dealing with the Midland project since he became CEO of CMS 11 years ago.
McCormick said the settlement removes the possibility of future earnings write-downs related to the project. CMS recorded an after-tax charge of $343 million in the fourth quarter of 1992 from an earlier settlement of Midland Cogeneration issues.  
CMS' stock was up $1 to $32-3/8. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 206,700, indicating trading for Friday would be more than 300,000 shares, heavier than normal, said McCormick.
CMS' construction of the facility as a nuclear power plant was abandoned in the mid-1980s. CMS finished its conversion to a gas-powered energy plant in 1990.
Midland Cogeneration, the largest cogeneration project in North and South America, is a partnership of CMS; Dow Chemical Co, Coastal Corp, Asea Brown Boveri Inc and Fluor Corp.
Approval of the settlement prompted Standard &amp; Poor's to revise its outlook on Consumers Power and CMS to positive from stable, and re-affirm its ratings on the companies.
McCormick said he believes CMS will be meeting with the debt rating agency to discuss a possible upgrade of its ratings.

4,"Talks aimed at averting a potentially crippling auto supplier strike at  American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Inc continued on Saturday morning after bargainers worked past the midnight Friday deadline.
""The folks are still there, they worked through the night,"" said a person close to the negotiations who asked not to be named. ""They seem in good spirits.""
A strike at American Axle would virtually shut down light truck production at General Motors Corp's 11 North American truck plants within days, and create more supply hardships for Ford Motor Co.
United Auto Workers leaders have not officially extended the strike deadline, but they also have not authorized members to start picketing, union members said on Saturday.
About 7,200 UAW members were poised to walk off their jobs at five plants in Detroit, Three Rivers, Mich., and Buffalo, N.Y., on Friday night if no agreement was reached on a new three-year contract.
American Axle, which was spun off from GM in 1994, supplies rear axles for GM's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars, as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.
The company makes axle shafts that are used by Ford in its F-150 pickup trucks, Expedition and Explorer sport/utilities and some rear-drive passenger cars, although those supplies are not as critical as the GM parts. It also makes axles for a small number of Chrysler Corp. light truck products.
Tight inventories among axle suppliers means GM's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week, analysts said. The world's largest automaker could lose after-tax profits of $20 million a day if it were forced to suspend light truck production, analysts said.
American Axle and the UAW are at odds over wages and other economic issues as the union seeks to impose on the company the same pattern contract the Big Three automakers agreed to for about 400,000 UAW members last fall.
Automakers guaranteed jobs for 95 percent of their current workforce in a contract that provides $2,000 lump sum payments in the first year and wage hikes of three percent in the second and third years. The pact allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $19.
American Axle, however, wants to start new hires at 60 percent of the base wage -- and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years, union officials said. The Big Three pact has a ""grow-in"" rate of three years.
But if the company were forced to match the Big Three pattern it would be at a severe cost disadvantage against its competitors, a company spokesman has said.
The American Axle talks have drawn attention because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract.
Meantime, a UAW strike against Johnson Controls Inc, a key seat supplier for Ford, entered its 19th day Saturday with no settlement.

4,"Chrysler Corp. said Thursday it expected strong December sales results to cap off a record year for the automaker, with total 1996 car and truck deliveries exceeding 2.4 million units.
Chrysler's year-end sales report, to be released Friday, is expected to be one of the few bright spots for December, a month in which analysts predict industry volume will fall as much as 6 percent from strong year-ago levels.
Despite an expected drop in General Motors Corp.'s December sales by as much as 16 percent from year-ago levels, analysts say automakers sold enough cars and trucks during the month to enable the full year totals to match U.S. industry sales projections of 15.1 million light vehicles.
Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz told reporters at the Los Angeles International Auto Show that he expected the automaker's total December vehicle sales to be ""several percentage points"" ahead of last year's sales of 177,803 cars and trucks, which was a record for the month of December.
For the full 1996 year, Chrysler's sales of more than 2.4 million units exceeded their 1988 record of 2,208,057 cars and trucks.
Light truck sales, which have been accounting for about 70 percent of Chrysler's total, are projected to rise 8 percent, offsetting an expected 9 percent slide in passenger car sales, said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy.
Healy said GM's sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans -- the light truck category -- will be down significantly, in large part because the automaker was up against a tough comparison from a year ago.
Car sales also will plunge by as much as 20 percent, estimates Michael Luckey, of Luckey Consulting Group. He attributes the decline largely to the continued aftershocks of GM's labour strife this fall, which cost the automaker about 120,000 units of mostly car production.
""They're still being hurt by the strikes,"" he said. ""I think that's still a legitimate reason for one more month here in December.""
GM is scheduled to report its sales on Friday, Jan. 3.
Ford Motor Co., scheduled to release its results Jan. 6, will enjoy one of its best year-to-year comparisons since March 1994, said Luckey, with sales rising between 8 percent and 9 percent against a somewhat weak performance in December 1995.
Robert Rewey, Ford group vice president of sales and marketing, said at the Los Angeles International Auto Show that he expected December car sales to be flat with the year-ago level, but truck sales were ""fantastic"" and should be up sharply.
Last week, Ford added another $500 to the $500 rebate it was already offering on the 1997 Taurus, indicating its determination to hang on the title of the best-selling car in America. Taurus sales through November were about 10,000 units over the rival Honda Accord.
""If Taurus sales spurt up, cars might be a little bit better than that,"" said Luckey.
Ford's light truck sales are seen rising a sharp 20 percent, Luckey said, thanks to the strength of its pickup trucks and popular Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle.
Imports and transplants continued to take market share from the Big Three in December, Healy said, climbing to a combined share of 28.6 percent, up from 28.1 percent in November.
""The strong dollar and the weak yen are resulting in aggressive pricing by the Japanese makers, particuarly in intermediate and small passenger cars,"" he said.
For December, the light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate is expected to be in the mid-14 million range, analysts said, a precipitous drop from 15.9 million a year ago, the strongest month of 1995.
However, Luckey said the Commerce Department factors used to compute the rate penalise the total by 800,000 units, meaning the real rate is stronger than it would appear.
Most analysts expect the industry to finish the year at 15.1 million units.
""It should be 15.1 million,"" said Luckey. ""That's almost certain unless something very strange happens in December.""
That total would bring the average for the last three years to an unusually stable 15 million mark. In 1995, total light vehicle sales were 14.7 million, down from 15.1 million for all of 1994.

17,"Silver King Communications Inc chairman Barry Diller said on Monday that the $1.27 billion stock-swap acqusition of Home Shopping Network would help fund Silver King's ambitious broadcasting plans.
""We have a long agenda and this helps certainly in developing the stations. We will get there quicker by combining the two companies,"" Diller told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Silver King agreed earlier to acquire HSN, a limping number two in U.S. TV retailing, for $1.27 billion in stock.  
The deal reunites Silver King, owner of 12 U.S. television stations spun off in 1992 by HSN, with its old parent and feeds speculation that Diller is close to launching a seventh U.S. television network.
Diller described as premature the speculation he would start a new national network, but said the cash flow from HSN would help Silver King pay for programming and other costs in developing its stations.  
Diller, a celebrated Hollywood executive credited with leading the 1980s launch of the FOX network, had already announced plans to drop HSN programming now carried on Silver King's stations in order to replace it with a traditional mix of locally oriented news, sports and other shows.
The stations in major markets such as Miami, New York and Los Angeles could attract significant audiences eagerly sought by advertisers, become much more valuable and form the nucleus of a national television network, industry analysts said.
""Silver King will use Home Shopping's cash flow. That will be the start of the benefits,"" Diller said.
""For Home Shopping, it adds businesses it is not now in,"" he said, adding the combined companies would be financially vigorous and poised to exploit new forms of electronic retailing.
""I am thrilled with the combination,"" Diller said.
""As to its more expansive possibilities, I believe the combination will allow the companies the very best way to pursue their very aggressive individual agendas with clarity and without conflict.""

17,"Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc agreed on Wednesday to buy over-the-counter market-maker  Nash, Weiss Inc, another step by the pioneering discount broker into low-profile, but lucrative financial services businesses.
Terms were not disclosed, but two sons of co-founder Leslie Quick Jr said in an interview that the acquisition of the New Jersey firm was by far the biggest deal Quick &amp; Reilly has done.
Nash, Weiss buys and sells on behalf of retail brokerages some 2,500 stocks listed on the Nasda.  
Salomon Brothers analyst Michael Sears said the acquisition may be the start of a flurry of deals involving market-makers in Nasdaq stocks as reforms in pricing threaten to narrow the often wide spreads on Nasdaq stocks.
Investors have complained that the price differences can amount to as much as 10 percent or more of a stock price.
""Going for market share through acquisitions is one way to make up for narrowing spreads,"" Sears said.
He said he knew of no pending deals.  
Among the top six independent Nasdaq market makers, Nash, Weiss profits on the spread, or difference between prices the seller and buyer get. It employs about 60 people, Quick &amp; Reilly said.
The biggest Nasdaq market makers are subsidaries of big financial firms.
""This gives us another major leg,"" said Leslie Quick III, head of the company's U.S. Clearing Corp subsidiary. ""We expect this Nasdaq market maker business to be a fourth leg for us.""  
Best known as a retail broker, Quick &amp; Reilly is also a significant force through U.S. Clearing in backroom processing of Wall Street trading and owner of the JCC Specialist Corp., the second-largest market-maker, or specialist firm, on the New York Stock Exchange.
""The deal really plays well with The Quick &amp; Reilly Group as whole,"" said Salomon Brothers analyst Michael Sears. ""With U.S. Clearing it gives Nash, Weiss a lot of potential for going after instutitional clients.""  
Thomas Quick, president of the firm, said Quick &amp; Reilly with Nash, Weiss would court institutional clients by adding to its roster of 2,500 securities in which it makes markets.
""That number will probably go to 3,500 to 4,000,"" Leslie Quick III said.
The brothers, whose father, chairman Leslie Quick Jr., co-founded the firm in the early 1970s, said the mightily improved  capitalization of Nash, Weiss after the merger with Quick &amp; Reilly will make it much more attractive to large institutional clients.  
Thomas Quick said the leading market-maker for institutional clients had capitalization of about $80 million, or 20 times or more that of Nash, Weiss. Sears said Quick &amp; Reilly had capitalization of about $350 million.
The brothers said they expect revenues at Nash, Weiss to rise dramatically as long as stock trading remains robust and may even double to $120 million by early 1998.
Business has been strong in December and in January and should yield a strong fiscal fourth-quarter, Thomas Quick said. He declined to comment on analysts forecasts of earnings. Sears expects Quick &amp; Reilly to report $0.77 a share for the period ending February 28. Last year, the company reported a normalized $0.91.
Co-founder Leslie Quick Jr serves as chairman and chief executive of the firm, which was the first to offer discounted commissions on New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks after fixed trading commissions were abolished in 1975.

17,"U.S. billionaire Wayne Huizenga shrugged off lawsuits filed by two Japanese motor giants, saying on Tuesday that the AutoNation car-retailing arm of his Republic Industries Inc never aspired to control one of every five Toyota and Honda sales in the United States.
Both Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd have filed suits in U.S. courts against AutoNation, one of several buyout companies prowling the tens of thousands of independent car retailers in the United States.
Each company wants AutoNation to stop buying retailers which sell its cars. In its suit filed last week, Honda said AutoNation was cheapening its Honda and Acura brands.
Both companies limit the number of dealerships which can be owned by one proprietor and have said AutoNation wants to control 20 percent of their U.S. sales.
""We never said 20 percent and we never expected to get that much,"" Huizenga told the annual shareholders meeting of Republic. ""We know we will be partners with them.""
A renowned businessman credited with creating giant video-retailer Blockbuster and Waste Management Corp, Huizenga said AutoNation could take minority stakes in Toyota and Honda dealerships or use other techniques for tapping into the strong sales flows of highly popular Toyota and Honda vehicles.
""There are ways to accomplish what we want,"" Huizenga said.
Huizenga is chairman and co-chief executive of Republic, an auto-services, home-security and garbage-hauling conglomerate which has bought dozens of small car dealerships and other businesses in the past 18 months using Republic's high-flying shares in stock-swaps.
But Republic's shares are 25 percent or more off their highs, at least in part to investors worries that rivals are beginning to narrow AutoNation's lead in consolidating used and new car dealerships.
Ford Motor Co executives last week briefed dealers in Indianopolis, Indiana, on a voluntary and highly innovative plan to gather together about 18 Indianapolis-area Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships into five or six giant sales outlets with stand-alone, satellite service facilities for light repairs and warranty work.
The giant centres, similar to the 11 AutoNation superstores now operating, would be owned by Ford and by participating dealers, a Ford spokesman has said.
Ford is looking to test the concept in two or three medium-sized markets in the next two to three years with an eye to a possible public offering.
""We welcome that,"" Republic president Steve Berrard said. ""We think it's a great endorsement.""
Besides AutoNation, Circuit City Stores Inc.'s CarMax and others are using many of the customer-friendly techniques pioneered by General Motors Corp's Saturn unit to court the two of every three Americans who hate to haggle.
Both GM and Chrysler Corp have had programmes to reduce their dealership ranks through consolidation and buy-outs, but neither has proposed as radical a restructuring of its distribution system.

17,"Florida is stepping up anti-smoking efforts by barring cigarette promotions on state roads, forcing Marlboro to drop its name from thousands of banners promoting the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami motor race.
New rules detailing limits on using banners to promote sports events, to be published on Friday, are due to take effect in early March, a Florida Department of Transportation official said.
Banners for beer, tobacco and other products meant for adults are covered by the new rules. Promoters can place a product name on the banners but cannot use type faces, logos and colours associated with the banned products.
""Most sporting events have a corporate name attached to them and that name would be allowed,"" said department spokeswoman Lynn Holschuh. ""But if it's a product that can't be sold to minors, the banner can't contain logos or significant advertising promoting the product.""
Advertising on billboards, often located on private property, will not be affected by the new rules covering state roadways, the official said. The rules do not affect municipal, Interstate and other roads maintained by other governments.
In Miami, an IndyCar-class grand prix site since 1983, thousands of coloured banners no longer bear the Marlboro name, even though the Feb. 4 to March 2 competition is officially called the Marlboro Miami Grand Prix presented by Toyota.
Banners for the event say simply, Grand Prix of Miami presented by Toyota.
Last year's banners carried the distinctive red colour and bold typface of Marlboro, the most popular cigarette in the United States.
A spokeswoman for Philip Morris Cos. Inc., maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said the company had chosen to drop the Marlboro name from the banners as a courtesy. State officials, including anti-tobacco activist Gov. Lawton Chiles, complained about the Marlboro signs last year.
""We will have signage and merchandise and cigarettes for sale to people 21 and over at the site,"" said Philip Morris spokeswoman Tara Carraro. ""We really want to reach smokers choosing brands.""
Marlboro, which along with RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. is a major sponsor of motorsports events, will back other IndyCar events this year in California, Ohio, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Such sponsorships are major promotional outlets for the U.S. tobacco industry, with the top two producers spending $50 million or more each year on motorsports sponsorships, according to the IEG Sponsorship Report newsletter.
Marlboro spent about $19 million on motorsport sponsorships and likely as much again on related advertising and promotion during 1996, according to David Jacobsen, senior editor at IEG.
Cigarette advertising has been banned since the 1960s from U.S. television and steadily driven from sponsoring many other sports. The industry now faces still stricter federal government limits on promoting its products.
The federal rules, the first of which are to take effect on Feb. 28, sharply curtail cigarette advertising near schools and playgrounds and in publications favoured by people under 18.
A spokesman for the National Centre for Tobacco Free Kids, an anti-smoking group, said Florida's roadway ban was unusual. Some local transit systems, in San Francisco and elsewhere, have dropped tobacco advertising, he said.
A spokesman for Chiles, who is spearheading a billion-dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry and advocating new state taxes on cigarettes, described him as pleased by the Marlboro's decision to take its name off the Miami race banners.

17,"Bloodied in court and so unpopular at home that Hollywood has made the tobacco executive its corporate villain of choice, U.S. cigarette makers remain diversified cash-generating machines with hot overseas markets.
Last year, tobacco exports from the United States were worth $5.24 billion, or roughly 20 percent of the country's total net agriculultural surplus.  
Cigarette export volumes rose 5.5 percent to a record 243.9 billion, with Japan the biggest buyer of American cigarettes, according to an industry group.
""For the big companies, overseas demand is exploding,"" said Roy Burry, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
And the big cigarette companies, with the exception of No. 5 Liggett Corp, are highly diversified with interests in food and beverages and other sectors.  
""The real problem for these businesses is the uncertainty,"" said one analyst who assesses the industry's U.S. legal risks as very high. ""You have all these wonderful businesses mucked up with cigarettes.""
Both Philip Morris Cos Inc and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, which together command well over half the U.S. cigarette market, generate half or slightly more of their revenues from snacks, beer, cereals and desserts.
""They are growing at more than 10 percent, and the cash they generate will be used to expand overseas or buy back stock,"" Burry said.  
Analyst Anton Brenner at UBS Securities said the big U.S. companies were building warehouses and plants overseas, especially in Eastern Europe and Asia, where cigarette sales are growing very quickly
""For better or worse, American cigarettes are better products,"" Brenner said.
Yet the industry took another shock on Thursday, when Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd, agreed to cooperate with 22 state attorneys general suing tobacco companies for government spending on health care for smokers.  
Liggett commands only a sliver of the U.S. cigarette market, with Chesterfield and other brands, and has been unprofitable for many years. But the deal prompted one of the attorneys general, who accuses the industry of conspiring to hide the dangers of cigarettes, to liken the event to police turning ""the wheelman"" of a gang of thieves.
Hundreds of other suits, filed by individuals and lawyers pressing class-action cases, are making their way through the courts.  
Two class-action suits, including one on behalf of flight attendants allegedly injured by second-hand smoke on aircraft, are scheduled to go to trial in Florida this year.
And in Hollywood, writers have taken up depicting tobacco executives as villains.
""The Practice,"" a legal drama on U.S. television telling a serialized tale of an elderly man suing over the death of his wife, a smoker, is just one of several films and shows in production with anti-tobacco themes.

17,"A Miami television journalist who produced a news report on niche-brand cigarettes was knocked from the pool of standby jurors in Florida's $5 billion secondhand smoke trial on Thursday.
The unidentified female television-news producer was among 15 people questioned by judge and lawyers on Wednesday. She said she had produced a television report for Fox station WSVN Channel 7 on cigarette marketing, scheduled for broadcast that evening. Despite tobacco lawyers objections, she was placed in the pool of potential jurors to sit on the trial, expected to last eight weeks or longer.
Tobacco company lawyers again on Thursday asked Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye to remove the freelance news producer, saying her piece negatively portrayed tobacco companies and reflected a bias making her unsuitable to fairly decide whether the defendants are liable for the smoking-related illnesses of 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants.
A tape of the short television report on flashily packaged Black Death, City and other so-called micro-brand cigarettes favored by some young smokers was shown in court and included interviews with shopkeepers, young smokers and a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society.
Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the class-action suit, said the television report had been very likely edited by other journalists and did not necessarily reflect the mindset of the news producer.
But Kaye sided with the tobacco lawyers and removed the woman from the standby jurors pool, saying, ""The appearance that it was weighted would make it inappropriate for her to be seated.""
After four days of jury selection, the standby jurors pool numbers 18. Some 60 are needed to seat a jury of six. A second round of screening will be required to find between six and 12 alternates before testimony can begin in the landmark trial, a court official said.
A nurse, a college student and an immigrant from Mexico were placed in the standby pool on Thursday. People excused by Kaye include a nun who described smoking as a vice and the sure cause of diseases she has seen firsthand as a nurse and several people with schooling or vacation plans fixed firmly during June and July.
Kaye late on Wednesday said he was reconsidering a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups as a way of speeding up jury selection. Tobacco company lawyers objected, saying that since smoking and attitudes about secondhand cigarette smoke were hot-buttom matters people had to be questioned separately.
A court official said Kaye would likely decide on group questioning of prospective jurors on Friday or later. Kaye earlier this week refused a similar request from Rosenblatt.
Jury questioning for the trial, the first on secondhand smoke claims, is likely to run through at least mid-June, in part because the jury selection next week will occur only on Monday and Tuesday because of a break for Jewish holidays.

17,"Taking mortgage-backed securities as a model, trucking giant Ryder System Inc is bargaining with a half dozen banks on possibly creating securitized financial offerings on as many as 15,000 leased trucks a year.
A first offering of securitized truck leases could come as early as March and all offerings could total as much as $700 million by year-end 1997, Ryder chief financial officer Ed Huston told Reuters.  
""We're thinking of taking a package of leases and selling them,"" Huston said. ""It's a variation of mortgage-backed securities.""
Huston said no deal, which would be an innovation among trucking services groups, had been agreed and warned an unforseeen issue could block the plan.
""We've talked to a number of banks and we are on the verge of selecting one,"" he said.
He declined to identify which banks Ryder was considering. Citicorp is currently a leading finance source for Ryder, Huston said.  
Ryder late Monday announced it would take a $215 million pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter and full-1996 results to pay for a restructuring, early-retirment and layoffs. The moves affect some 2,100 people and should yield savings in 1997 of $75 million for Ryder and $150 million annually afterwards, Huston said.
The charge was bigger than Wall Street expected, Merrill Lynch analyst Jeff Kauffman said.
""It reflects a conviction by management to change things .... Shareholders really want to see some changes and some of them are losing faith in the story. The onus has been put on management to deliver results,"" he said.
""We are encouraged by their conviction. They seem to be in earnest,"" Kauffman said.  
Ryder, which last year agreed to sell its consumer-truck rental operations, now buys about 25,000 each year. Some 15,000 of those would be suitable for lease-backed securitization, Huston said.
Ryder, he said, may be able to free equity by the lease-backed offerings and get lower costs because lease-backed offerings typically get better ratings than company debt instruments.
Ryder now has single A and A- ratings on its debt and might secure a triple A rating on its lease-back offerings, Huston said.
Shares of Ryder were up 3/4 to 29-1/8.

17,"A Florida judge said Friday that he was inclined to let stand civil claims filed under state anti-racketeering laws against the tobacco industry.
Speaking from the bench at the start of a preliminary hearing, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen said he was inclined to let stand claims filed by the state using Florida's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupts Organisations Act, which could mean more losses for cigarette makers.
""It would seem that the state can maintain the RICO actions,"" Cohen said.
The claims under state RICO laws were added last month to the state's existing lawsuit that seeks at least $1 billion compensation for treating smokers' illnesses.
The judge said he would not make up his mind until the end of oral arguments on Friday.
He gave no timetable for making public his decision on a request by Philip Morris Cos. and other cigarette makers that the claims made by the state under RICO laws be thrown out.
Florida State Attorney General Bob Butterworth said before the hearing that a victory against tobacco companies using the RICO law would allow the court to triple the more than $1 billion dollars in damages claimed by the state.
He also said a victory in Florida using its RICO law would widen the war against the tobbaco industry by possibly allowing other states to sue under their own RICO laws.
Lawyer Irving Nathan, representing the tobacco industry, said that lawsuits brought by state governments under anti-racketeering laws were meant to demonise cigarette manufacturers and turn Americans against a legitimate industry.
Nathan argued that the RICO laws did not apply to the tobacco companies that are also being sued in Florida.
The state of Florida in 1995 filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, seeking $1 billion or more for health care costs paid for poor people afflicted with smoking-related ailments.
Last month the state amended the suit using the RICO law and claiming that the tobacco companies had conspired with one another to confuse Americans about the dangers of smoking.
Cohen is not expected to rule for weeks on the tobacco defendents' request that the RICO claims be dismissed but he said in opening remarks that he was inclined to allow the Florida state lawyers to go ahead with the RICO-based claims.
A jury trial of the suit is tentatively scheduled for August 1997, the judge said.
Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, who accompanied Butterworth to the hearing along with Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, said the lawsuits filed by 19 states and several cities were about much more than mere money. The lawsuits were needed to alert people to the dangers of smoking and help curb smoking among teenagers.
""That helps me sell the litigation more than the money,"" Moore said.

17,"Two leading international satellite-television groups said on Wednesday they will overcome regulatory hurdles and enter Argentina, a country already heavily penetrated by pay-television and whose satellite-TV rights are held by a smaller rival.
""We intend to be there; it's key to our strategy,"" said Mark Goldman, a vice president of News Corp Ltd, at a Latin American investors conference sponsored by Kagan Seminars International.  
Kagan analyst Jimena Urquijo said Nahuelsat, a smaller direct-to-home (DTH) service owned in part by Argentine investors and Daimler-Benz AG of Germany, already sells satellite-TV services in Argentina and holds exclusive satellite-TV rights for the country.
""Both will have to deal with Nahuelsat,"" Urquijo said, referring to Galaxy Latin America and Sky Entertainment Latin America.  
Galaxy, owned by Hughes Electronics Corp of the United States, the Cisneros Group of Venezuela, Multivision of Mexico and TVA Abril of Brazil, and Sky Entertainment have satellite-TV services in other parts of Latin America and plan to expand.  Sky Entertainment is owned by multi-national News Corp, Tele-Communications Inc of the United States, Mexico's Grupo Televisa SA de CV and TV Globo of Brazil.
Erik Moe, vice president of Galaxy Latin America, said he expected his company would eventually enter Argentina.  
""We recognize that there's a regulatory environment which does not encourage DTH,"" Goldman said. ""We are lobbying the (Argentine) government.""  Neither executive gave a target date for entering Argentina, and Nauhelsat chief executive Eckart Schober declined to answer when asked if he expected DTH rivals to appear in Argentina.
Nahuelsat already sells a stripped-down, relatively low-cost DTH service in rural areas of Argentina outside Buenos Aires, a metropolitan area with more than one-quarter of the country's pay-television subscribers and served by such cable-television giants as Tele-Communications.  
Nahuelsat tailors its services to national and regional tastes, Schober said at the Kagan conference.
Urquijo said business fundamentals in the country are also daunting for the two big DTH groups, given that 52 percent, or more than four million, of Argentina's television homes already subscribe to pay television.  Nahuelsat itself is primarily targeting Argentine regions without cable or microwave television services.
""I'm not sure there's room for three competitors,"" Urquijo said.
By contrast, other parts of Latin America are much more open to DTH.   Only some 13.3 percent of Latin America's 80
million television homes now take any type of pay television, a much smaller share than in western Europe or the United States, according to the Kagan organization.
Satellite-television in the United States, the most heavily penetrated pay-television market in the world, with some two thirds of homes subscribing to cable, has been a huge success in just two years.  Millions of subscribers in both cities and areas without cable have paid $500 or more for receivers during the past two years.

17,"Sterling Software Inc's $165 million purchase of Texas Instruments Inc software unit will close on June 14 and will help Sterling's financials almost immediately, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday.  
""Three or four minutes,"" Sterling Williams told Reuters when asked how long Sterling Software would spend integrating Texas Instrument's 1,300 staff and 62 facilities around the world. ""It will enhance both profits and revenues almost immediately,"" Williams said.
Williams also said Sterling Software's cash holdings, enlarged greatly by last fall's spinoff of Sterling Commerce Inc, remain largely intact after the Texas Instruments' deal and will be used to pay for more acquisitions.  
Founded in 1981 and with more than two dozen acquisitions to its credit, the company will have some $600 million in cash after the Texas Instruments' check is written, Williams said.
""The biggest opportunities out there are in applications software,"" Williams said. ""Size doesn't attract or repel us.""  
Applications software groups, such as the Texas Instruments' business Sterling is buying, help design new software for big organizations and cobble together different computer systems.
Sterling is also interested in companies which produce software for big computer systems, Williams said.  
The Texas Instruments' acquisition announced a month ago will add $250 million in annual revenues to Sterling Software and better than double to half the portion of Sterling Software revenues which come from applications software operations, Williams said.
Sterling had fiscal 1996 revenues of about $440 million.  
Williams said Sterling Software's top executives had spent the past month meeting TI Software's managers around the world and had clear, detailed plans for weaving the unit into Sterling.
He said cost savings would come through cuts in research and administration and that layoffs would likely be minimal. The combined sales forces would allow broader marketing of Sterling Software's products and services, he said.
""Our ramp up basically takes place before the announcement,"" he said. ""But there is a settling-in phase where you make course corrections.""  
The combination would stimulate sales growth in Sterling's applications operations, which had been flat in fiscal 1996 after fast growth in the early 1990s, Williams said.
He declined to discuss detailed forecasts.
TI's customers will be largely new ones for Sterling and acceptance of the deal among customers seems to be good, Williams said.
""Not a single customer called and said he was worried,"" he said.
Sterling Software shares rose 5/8  and closed at 32-1/4.

35,"Falling world metal prices have spooked Asian aluminium traders who said on Monday up to 80,000 tonnes of the metal was sitting in Chinese ports, having been ordered by consumers who now want to pay the lower prices.
""A lot of people have aluminium stuck in China,"" a trader based in Hong Kong with a European firm said.
""There's more than 80,000 tonnes that I know of,"" he said.
Another industry source in Hong Kong said 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes of aluminium was stuck in Hong Kong and the nearby south Chinese port of Shantou, having been destined for Chinese end-users who refused to pay for it.
Chinese trading companies have earned poor reputations in recent years for reneging on deals when world prices of the commodity they are buying fall between the date the order was placed and the date of its arrival.
Metal traders in Hong Kong and Beijing said they had been waiting for news of distressed cargoes as they watched prices fall.
Another trading source said figures of up to 80,000 tonnes of distressed aluminium were believable given the amount in Hong Kong and Shantou, as material was also being shipped to other ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin.
""People will stop selling to China until the price goes up again,"" he said. ""And the price won't move up again until the LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks fall. There's just too much there.""
On top of this has been a general slowdown in metals business to China, traders said. None polled by Reuters saw business improving before the end of 1996.
Latest LME figures show aluminium stocks at 961,450 tonnes. The LME's aluminium price has been hitting long-term lows in recent trading weeks.
Prices picked up from 2-1/2-year lows on Friday as news emerged that some Russian smelters were considering cutting production.
LME three-months aluminium ended at US$1,337 a tonne, not much different from Thursday but firmer than before the news and somewhat above a low hit on Thursday of $1,305.
A year ago, the price was $1,742.
""Some people are forecasting the price will move to $1,250,"" another Hong Kong trader said. But he added: ""There is good support at the $1,300 level.""
LME warehouses in Singapore had plenty of metal, he said, but it was commanding a premium over the LME cash price of $30 to $40, and ocean freight rates to China were $65 a tonne.
""This is the main problem -- no trader can afford it. No one can afford it,"" he said.
Chinese consumers were mostly buying hand-to-mouth, waiting for prices to reach rock-bottom, traders said.
""Once the price starts to move up again they will buy, because they will see the bottom has been hit,"" the European trader said.
Traders said world metals markets would probably spend the fourth quarter of 1996 defining a direction for 1997, when fundamentals should begin to play a role in firming the price.

35,"Sky-high world copper prices do not seem to be supported by fundamentals and could soon be in for a liquidation-related correction, Chinese copper trading sources said on Monday.
""I don't really see any support for $2,400,"" a Chinese source on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) said.
""If the price can go above $2,400 a tonne and stay up there for a decent period, that would indicate some support,"" he said. ""But I think the funds are under pressure to sell.""
London Metal Exchange (LME) copper came under heavy pressure from liquidation and end-week sales on Friday after surging to a nine-month high of $2,445 a tonne.
The market fell back to close Friday's kerb at $2,390, a $13 fall on Thursday's close.
Shanghai copper futures ended down across the board on Monday on heavy profit-taking, with the most active June 1997 contract ending at 23,370 yuan ($2,817), losing 50 yuan.
Traders said the correction came on the back of the LME's Friday falls.
The SME trading source said he would sell at 23,300 yuan per tonne. Monday's intra-day low was 23,200 yuan and he saw it going down further this week to 22,800.
LME copper appeared set to test the downside on Monday, with the first support level at $2,350, London analysts said.
This had the support of Chinese traders, one of whom said from the southern Zhuhai Special Economic Zone that LME copper prices should consolidate around $2,320-2,380.
He and others ruled out Chinese activity in the immediate term, saying prices were still too high to justify buying.
The official China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday that China's demand for copper would reach 1.2 million tonnes in 1997.
China's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, according to State Statistical Bureau figures.
Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.
Copper imports are expected to remain high, media reports have said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-8544

35,"Genetically-altered soybeans at the centre of an international environmental furore are causing little concern in China, a major soybean importer with its own bio-engineering programmes, industry sources said on Wednesday.
""China is a very public and vocal supporter of our technology,"" said a source at Monsanto Co, the developer of the first genetically-altered U.S. soybeans.
""The Chinese have been heavily involved in their own programmes to produce insect-resistant cotton and genetically-altered soybeans, corn and rice,"" the source in Hong Kong, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Monsanto has been targeted in the United States and now in Europe by environmental groups opposed to genetic engineering.
The soybeans have been developed with a resistance to a widely-used weed killer called Roundup, also a Monsanto product.
""I would think they would be very happy in China to get their hands on some of this product if they are pest-resistant,"" an industry executive in China said.
""They have a lot of their own problems with insects, especially in their soy and corn crops,"" he said.
The Monsanto source said Chinese research, while a good decade behind his own company's, mirrored Monsanto's efforts at developing pest and insecticide resistant crops.
""So I wouldn't expect there to be any concern in China about this product,"" he said.
He said Monsanto was negotiating for co-operative projects in China, but would not give further details.
Greenpeace and other environmental campaigners were preparing on Tuesday to picket the arrival in Hamburg of a ship believed to be carrying some of the Monsanto soybeans.
Greenpeace activists in Hong Kong, however, said on Wednesday that despite concerns, they had no plan to campaign against the sale of the genetically-altered beans in Asia.
""The problem is we don't know what form it is in -- in powder form, in animal feed, mixed into hamburger meat -- so we have no way of knowing if we are eating it,"" said Clement Chan, spokesman for Greenpeace in Hong Kong.
""The beans have not been extensively tested before being made available to the public so we don't know what we are doing to human or animal bodies,"" he said.
Other than providing information on request, Greenpeace had no plan of action against the beans in Asia, Chan said.
The beans have been approved for use in Japan, the biggest buyer of U.S. soybean products, the Monsanto source said.
User-groups in other countries, such as the Food and Drink Industry Association of the Netherlands, have also said they will use the genetically-altered U.S. soybeans.
Grain traders and industry executives in Asia said they had received no expression of concern from potential buyers in the region about the altered soybeans and did not expect to.
""They represent a very small proportion of the U.S. crop at this stage,"" a grain trader in Singapore said, adding the beans could account for 10 percent of the total U.S. crop in 1997.
The U.S. soybean crop, now more than 70 percent harvested, is expected to be more than 64 million tonnes, according to the American Soybean Association. Of that, 24.8 million tonnes will go to export markets.
While not among the biggest customers for U.S. soybean products, China is expected to buy around one million tonnes of beans in calendar 1996, and up to two million tonnes of meal.

35,"Talks aimed at averting a Chinese ban on imports of United States poultry have been hailed as a success by U.S. officials, who said on Friday they expected the issue to vanish without any disruption to a major market.
A Chinese ban on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states, worth nearly US$500 million a year, was now unlikely to be implemented, official U.S. sources said.
""I'm optimistic that the issue has been resolved,"" a U.S. diplomat in Beijing said by telephone.
""Hopefully, this thing will now be dropped. I'm not expecting any correspondence or a list -- sometimes no news is good news,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A two-man team from Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) spent two days in meetings with China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) and scientists from other government departments and universities.
The aim of the talks was to convince CAPQ that U.S. poultry does not carry a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), contrary to Chinese fears that led to the ban.
""We are hopeful this issue has been resolved,"" said Ray Miyamoto, the APHIS area director in Beijing. ""We feel their (CAPQ's) primary concerns were adequately addressed.""
Miyamoto added that CAPQ planned to write a report that may or may not be made available to APHIS.
The meetings ended on Thursday. CAPQ was not immediately available for comment.
U.S. sources described the talks as ""frank, open and candid"" and said they augured well for other discussions slated for November on plant quarantine issues.
Wheat, however, remains shrouded in politics. Washington claims a Chinese ban on accepting wheat from specific U.S. areas because it cannot be guaranteed free of a fungus called TCK smut is, in effect, a non-tariff trade barrier.
A top-level Chinese delegation is due to leave for the United States this weekend for a two-week TCK fact-finding trip.
The poultry ban came to light on October 10 after U.S. chicken meat imports were blocked. CAPQ confirmed it to U.S. Embassy officials in Beijing the next day in a telephone call.
Nothing was ever received in writing from CAPQ, a source at the embassy said on Friday, and the ban was not implemented as CAPQ wanted first to hear what the U.S. experts had to say.
What the experts said, according to sources close to the meetings, was that HPAI, while widespread in wildfowl, was eradicated from commercial U.S. flocks in the mid-1980s.
The U.S. side seemed convinced that CAPQ had confused HPAI with the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI, which an APHIS source likened to the common cold.
Another U.S. source said the Chinese fears had been fuelled during a visit to Texas by CAPQ personnel to check on ostrich breeding stock destined for farms in southern China.
A number of birds there tested positive for HPAI, the source said, though this did not necessarily mean they were afflicted with the virus.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products and its only market for chicken feet.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, worth US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
The council's representative in Hong Kong, Sarah Li, told Reuters about 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China every day.

35,"Tin production at one of China's biggest mines has been cut by summer flooding, but a lacklustre market means business has not been affected, an executive with Deng's Yunnan Tin Corp said on Monday.
Gejiu Tin Mine in southern Yunnan province was damaged by floods in June and July, deputy general manager Sheng Weichung told Reuters.
Deng's Yunnan Tin Corp is the Hong Kong representative and trading arm of Yunnan Tin Corp, China's biggest tin producer.  
In 1995, Sheng said, Yunnan Tin Corp produced 20,000 tonnes of tin. The Gejiu mine was the company's biggest, he said.
""But business has been slow in China because the world market is soft and because of domestic restructuring of the industry, changes in government policy and tight credit,"" Sheng said. ""So a cut in production at the Gejiu mine would not have any adverse affect on China's overall tin industry picture.""
It was unclear how extensive the damage to the mine was, he said, or by how much production had been cut.  
China expected to produce 45,000 tonnes of tin in 1996, an official of the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp said in July.
He forecast 1996 exports of 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes.
Total 1995 tin exports were 43,307 tonnes, down 2.4 percent on the year before, China's State Statistical Bureau reported.
Total Chinese tin production for the first half of 1996 was down 6.14 percent on the same 1995 period, to 25,944 tonnes, the figures show.  
Exports for the first half of 1996 of unwrought tin and tin alloys were 12,867 tonnes, down 27 percent on the first half of 1995, customs figures show.
Tin exports in June were 3,339 tonnes.
Despite its size and the high quality of its product, Yunnan Tin Corp was still a ""loss-making state enterprise"" and as such was facing tough times, Sheng said.
A labour force of 100,000 had been cut within the past two years to 40,000 with the introduction of a redundancy programme that offered lump sum payments, he said.  
Senior management had also been trying to raise capital abroad to help get expansion projects off the ground, he said.
Other metals markets in China continued slow, traders said.
A return to pre-summer volatility that saw London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices fluctuate sharply throughout last week would keep China business slow, traders said.
Three month copper values on the LME traded between $1,905 and $1,970 a tonne in the July 30-August 29 period, giving traders some hope that calm had returned to the market after Sumitomo Corp revealed in June it had lost US$1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised trading.  
But the calm was shortlived. On September 2, copper prices spiked to a 2-1/2 month high of $2,195, before slumping back on Friday to $1,915.
""I think the market will go down again,"" a trader in Singapore said.
A lack of buyers for Chinese aluminium products had led to domestic stockbuilding, trading sources said.
""They are in the market to export, but there is no real market for them...we are not touching it,"" another source said.
Singapore premiums for zinc were firm at around $65-70 over the LME cash price, traders said.  
Another source added the only zinc available for trading in Singapore was Chinese, ""and the Chinese are working on a fixed price basis"" of around $1,080 to $1,120 a tonne.
Three month LME zinc closed six dollars down on Friday at $1,034 a tonne.

35,"Chinese end-users of copper are buying the metal in small lots but Chinese trading sources said on Tuesday that high world prices would prevent any significant Chinese buying in the short term.
A fall last Friday in copper stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses was not fully attributable to Chinese buying, traders in China and Hong Kong said.
LME copper stocks fell 9,675 tonnes, to 187,777 tonnes last Friday amid reports that most of that material was on its way to China.
""For the time being only one third of the stock moving out of LME warehouses will head to China, because they are taking out their own material,"" a Chinese trader with a provincial-government firm in Hong Kong said.
A trader in Beijing with a major European trading house said China was more likely to sell copper at current prices.
LME three months prices finished the kerb at $2,367 a tonne, down just $1 from Friday's kerb close. The cash/threes backwardation was at $55/60.
""If I bought at $2,310 and I sell at $2,370, I make $60 a tonne,"" the Beijing trader said.
""This does suggest some speculative Chinese action on the LME, but I don't see anything major, long or short, from China,"" he said.
Trading sources said copper prices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) did not indicate any real tightness in domestic Chinese supply.
Figures released by the exchange last Friday showed an increase in copper supplies held on warrant in SME warehouses of 664 tonnes to 13,522 tonnes, which traders here said is about two months' supply.
The exchange is also known to have off-warrant stocks, and China's central reserve has warehouses in the city holding undisclosed tonnages.
Another Chinese trading source in Hong Kong said he was seeing some interest from Chinese end-users who were ordering in small lots of 500 to 2,000 tonnes at a time.
""Some customers in Shanghai are placing small orders and they will take the cargo because they are end-users and they need it,"" he said.
Another source with a Chinese trading firm in Singapore said tight cash flow would also keep smelters off the market until government funds became available later in the first half of 1997.
Trading sources in London and Asia have predicted a further fall in stocks on Tuesday of 25,000 tonnes.

35,"The jump in London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc prices to a 4-1/2 year high, as yet, threatens no flood of Chinese metal onto the market, but producers are sitting on a windfall, traders said on Monday.
The main flow of Chinese zinc exports is currently headed for Japan attracted by its preferential duty free policy for metal imports from developing countries up until April 1, a trader with a European firm in Hong Kong said.
""Chinese zinc is very tight otherwise and you won't see any indications for a while,"" she said.  
LME three-month zinc touched a 4-1/2 year high of $1,266 a tonne on Friday, before a slight fall back to close at $1,254, up $12.
Far East metal traders and producer representatives in the region agreed the metal has yet to hit its peak, with some expecting a consolidation around $1,240 and others predicting a push towards $1,350 before a consolidation.
Official China customs figures show China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in January, 1997 reached 30,914 tonnes, up 100.3 percent compared to the year-ago period.  
Exports were boosted by high LME prices and a reduction in a Chinese export tax on the metal from five percent in 1996 to nil this year, boosting the value of domestic zinc by $50 a tonne.
""This year should be an historic year for Chinese zinc metal exports -- if the price stays high,"" a Beijing dealer said.
He said he believed total Chinese zinc exports would hit 80,000 tonnes for January and February 1997, and possibly half a million tonnes for the whole year.
China exported a total of 226,777 tonnes of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in 1996, up 18.4 percent on 1995, the customs figures show.  
But an executive with a Western producer that supplies to the region said he had so far seen no evidence of increased Chinese zinc sales to the Asian market.
""The supply and demand fundamentals on physical metal are improving as far as expectations of price hikes and continued support go,"" he said. This would see prices firm further.
""I am telling my customers that it is best for them to place their orders as soon as possible, as the trend is rising and we don't know where it will go,"" the representative for a major North American producer said.  
LME zinc could probably move up at least another $100 a tonne and this would see premiums start to soften as producers and sellers tried to compete, he said.
Traders pegged current CIF special high grade zinc premiums in Hong Kong at $130 a tonne over the LME cash price and high grade at $120 a tonne.
The Beijing trader said Chinese smetlers were selling at a $40 premium FOB Chinese ports. High grade was selling at a discount of $25 a tonne, he said.  
""I think LME zinc will be volatile,"" he said. ""Some people were saying last year they thought it would go to $1,400 but I wouldn't be so bullish.""

35,"China's flagship futures bourse, the Shanghai Metal Exchange, has ambitions to become Asia's premier metals trading floor, but economic realities are holding it back, the exchange's president said on Friday.
Total turnover since the exchange opened in May 1992 has topped 180 billion yuan ($21 billion) and efforts at regulation have curbed speculation, Hu Yuezheng said in an interview.
The exchange's 120 members include China's biggest base metals producers. All of them, along with the central government, now use the exchange's prices to monitor the market, Hu told Reuters.
Measures introduced in 1994 and 1995 to reduce speculation on the exchange had cut turnover to 230 billion yuan last year, from 455.8 billion yuan in 1995, Hu said.
But the introduction of several major regulations would see 1997 turnover expand on the 1996 figure, he said, but refused to make any projections.
Although greater market regulation has boosted its credibility, the Shanghai Metal Exchange still remains a long way from a place on the world trading stage, Hu said.
International metals trade is conducted in U.S. dollars, but China's yuan is not fully convertible, he said. Foreign investors are also not allowed to trade on China's futures exchanges.
China has no securities law and the quality of Chinese product lagged far behind world standards, he added.
But Hu said: ""It is of course my hope"" that Shanghai will become the East Asian equivalent to the London Metal Exchange (LME). Sipping tea from a Chicago Mercantile Exchange mug, Hu listed the market's current regulations, including margin requirements, limit up and limit down, daily clearance, and strict payment and delivery rules.
Limit up and limit down rules, designed to minimise risk, covered three trading days, Hu said, after which traders suffering losses of more than six percent were required to enter their losses in the exchange computer so they could be offset against gains.
""On day one, the limit is three percent, on day two it is four percent and margin requirements are then increased from five (percent) to six percent,"" he said.
""If it is still limit up by day three, the limit increases to five percent and the margin requirement increases to eight percent,"" he said.
Speculators would then be required to offset their positions, he said. And if there were no speculators, then hedgers would be required to do so.
""Why did we do it like this? Because over the past few years we have had many speculators here trying to squeeze the market and in this way we have brought some stability to the market, and our members feel their interests are protected,"" Hu said.
Up to 20 percent of the exchange's total turnover was now generated by producer and consumer hedging, he said.
While prices on the exchange are often move in tandem with those on the LME, Hu said Shanghai price levels increasingly reflected local fundamentals.
""At the moment there is no real relationship between the two exchanges,"" he said. ""China's rapid economic development has seen copper demand grow and now the country must import 30 percent of its needs, now around 1.1 million tonnes a year.""
""This need is what influences international prices,"" he said.
""There will always be contradictions between activity and regulation, but we feel it is more important to have a regulated market,"" he said.

35,"Copper and zinc were the main focus of attention for Far East metal traders on Monday, though China's exit from the market to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Ox left a gaping hole in trading activity.
China has closed down to celebrate the arrival of the new lunar year. Most Chinese markets will be closed until February 17, though trading activity should start to pick up mid-week.
A slight fundamental tightness in copper supply was seen throughout the region, a trader in Singapore told Reuters, adding that it was not being helped by high cash prices.
""Even in mainland China we understand people are having difficulty in obtaining metal,"" he said. ""Obviously the high cash price is somewhat of a deterrent but if they need physical metal they just have to buy it.""
Three months copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) ended the Friday afternoon kerb at $2,239 a tonne, after profit-taking trimmed $18 off Thursday's closing price.
Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.
Chinese media reported last month that China's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes. Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes, after 1996's 909,700 tonnes, Market Daily said.
Copper imports were expected to remain high, the newspaper said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes.
The few trading sources available on Monday said end-users of the red metal in Asia were buying hand-to-mouth, but there was as yet no element of panic-buying.
""If you start to see some significant increase in demand, then I think that's where the market will have some interest via higher prices,"" one trader said.
Zinc enters the Year of the Ox as a bull for Asian traders, some of whom thought recent rallies that have seen LME prices touch two-year highs could be more in anticipation of upcoming tightness than a reflection of current fundamentals.
LME zinc hit a fresh two-year high of $1,196 a tonne in early Friday trading, ending the day $3 easier at $1,183 a tonne.
What one Asian trader described as ""the magical and psychological level"" of $1,200 a tonne is the metal's next test, followed by the January 1995 peak of $1,239.
Traders' optimism that current price levels would consolidate before true tightness hit the market in the second half of 1997 were being fuelled by this year's shortfall in global supply of up to 250,000 tonnes, they said.
Lack of Chinese activity in the zinc market during the holiday period was not seen by trading sources as impacting on price movements one way or the other.
But word that Chinese producers had already moved 20,000 tonnes of zinc to Singapore warehouses, and that another 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes was on the way, was indicative of their selling interest, traders said.
""I'm not sure that there is any interest in immediately selling it but they (Chinese producers) are moving it very close to a market where they can sell it, deliver it and get cash in two days,"" another Singapore source said.
Chinese metal producers often moved their product to Singapore, keeping it off-warrant so it does not show up in LME stock reports but where it can be used as collateral, he said.
If the market remained strong, Chinese zinc could stay put as producers waited for prices to rise even further, he said.
""If they hold off on the anticipation of higher prices, it is just a gamble, and how quickly they sell into a retracement is difficult to know -- but they certainly don't appear to be overly concerned at present,"" he said.

35,"Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of copper have moved through Chinese customs into central stocks and are staying put, despite fears the metal could be sold to take advantage of current high prices, traders said on Monday.
""It was a good decision to buy good quality metal at 85 to 90 (U.S.) cents a pound; now they are feeling smug,"" a South American industry executive said of China's central authorities.
""It is central buying, there is no doubt about that because none of it is moving out,"" he said.
China recently boosted central copper reserves by 300,000 tonnes, with most of it now having cleared customs formalities, although a lag in Chinese customs reporting may keep the figures off the books for a couple of months, trading sources said.
Few Chinese trading companies would have the financial resources to buy and then store substantial amounts of copper, a Shanghai trader said.
The recent surge in world spot prices had been expected to fuel a flow of Chinese material on to the world market.
But a modest rise last week in stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses in Singapore -- traders said about 3,000 tonnes -- indicated the Chinese material was staying home.
""It's a piddling amount,"" a trader in Hong Kong said of the increase in stocks in Singapore.
LME copper trading has been volatile in recent weeks, with a moderate rise in stocks on Friday, the first since early September, pushing prices down on profit-taking and liquidation.
Three months copper finished Friday at US$2,242, bouncing off support around $2,220 in the afternoon ring, dealers said.
Losses were kept to a minimum, they said, as market jitters centred on the upcoming December options declaration. The main concern was if December copper came close to $2,600, where there was a large concentration of open interest on calls.
With LME stocks at 92,475 tonnes and the spot price at 2,470.50, the LME does not have enough copper to cover calls with a strike price of $2,600, which total 168,750 tonnes.
Traders in Asia seemed largely uninterested in the Wednesday options expiry as China is seen to be flush with copper and not interested in selling.
What little movement there has been out of China, some of which was possibly included in the 3,000-tonne hike in Singapore, was in small lots of probably no more than 1,000 tonnes at a time, the Shanghai trader said.
While China was neither actively buying nor selling now, it would have to boost imports to keep pace with demand next year, traders said.
""The market is physically tight so it is very good for the producers,"" a marketing executive with a major producer said.
He said China's crackdown on scrap imports, coupled with expected casualties among domestic smelters, would lead to total Chinese copper imports in 1997 of 830,000 tonnes.
The opening in February or March of a new smelter in Anhui province near the top-of-the-line Tongling smelter would account for an increase over 1996, he said.
Official customs figures show January to October 1996 imports of cast and unwrought copper were up 28.8 percent on 1995, to 549,571 tonnes, with October imports 82,655 tonnes.
The new smelter, a joint venture between Tongling and Japan's Itochu Corp and Sumitomo Corp had already booked 210,000 tonnes of concentrate imports for the year, the marketing executive said.
""They are looking at smelting 330,000 tonnes of concentrate, and producing 110,000 tonnes of metal,"" he said.

16,"The French government said on Tuesday it was ready to relaunch the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF and appointed key executives to oversee the sale.
""The government has just taken the decisions necessary for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF to enter the operational phase,"" the industry and finance ministries said in a joint statement.
An attempt to sell the whole Thomson electronics group last year floundered when the independent Privatisation Commission rejected the sale of parent company Thomson SA to the missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere Groupe for a symbolic one franc.
The government said on Tuesday it would make Marcel Roulet, formerly chairman of both Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF, responsible for the sale of the defence subsidiary on a full-time basis. He will now only be chairman of Thomson-CSF.
It also appointed Thierry Breton, formerly a deputy chairman of French computer maker Cie des Machines Bull, as chairman of Thomson SA and its wholly-owned consumer electronics unit, Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
Breton will be responsible for privatising TMM and will shortly make proposals on the sale, the statement said.
""First of all, it is the signal that the two things are really separate, with two different men who will exclusively work on Thomson-CSF and the handling of the privatisation of TMM,"" an industry ministry official said.
""The second signal is that, effectively, we are relaunching the TMM privatisation with a new head who will soon make proposals to the government on the procedure,"" he added.
The government will inject 11 billion francs ($1.9 billion) of fresh capital into TMM by the summer, following approval from the European Commission.
TMM, which makes television sets and video cassette recorders, will be sold gradually through an opening up of its capital, the statement said.
A source close the deal said the TMM sale would follow the lines of the past Bull privatisation -- a trade sale accompanied by a list of conditions, rather than a stock market flotation.
TMM would need sound finances to float on the bourse but is losing money and requires industrial partners who would take a medium-term view rather than stock market investors, who look to the short term, the source said.
An industry source said the boards of Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF met on Tuesday morning to discuss the terms and conditions of Thomson-CSF's privatisation.
A key objection by the Privatisation Commission to the government's first sale attempt was the planned sale by Lagardere of loss-making TMM to the South Korean Daewoo Electronics group, again for one symbolic franc.
Lagardere wanted to retain Thomson-CSF and merge its Matra Defense Espace unit with Thomson to create an integrated defence company with radar, satellite and missile interests.
The government has now decided to sell Thomson-CSF, 58 percent owned by Thomson SA, separately from TMM.
Detailed terms and conditions are expected to be announced shortly, opening the way for companies to make fresh bids for Thomson-CSF. Both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom have said they are interested.
TMM last week posted a 1996 net attributable loss of 3.1 billion francs, which included hefty provisions for factory closures and the expected loss of up to 10,000 jobs.
But it expects to break even at the operating level next year and be profitable from 1999 when U.S. patent revenues come on stream.
Thomson-CSF announced last week it returned to profit in 1996 after three years of losses, showing a net attributable profit of 745 million francs.

16,"The European Airbus consortium said on Tuesday it was confidently pressing ahead with studies on a 555-seat passenger plane despite a decision by archrival Boeing to scale back work on a larger jumbo jet.
Boeing on Monday said market conditions did not justify the risk and expense of building a new version of its 747 jumbo jet, the 747-X, and it was diverting half the 1,000 staff on that project to smaller planes.
""We are confident the A3XX will meet market needs,"" an Airbus spokesman said. ""The signs from major airlines working with us on shaping the A3XX are definitely encouraging.""
Airbus, ever quick to seize on any perceived gaps in Boeing's armour, says airlines want an all-new plane rather than Boeing's 747-X, which the Airbus spokesman said was the ""end of the line for a product developed in the late 1960s"".
""Airlines want to fly into the 21st century facing forward, not backwards,"" the spokesman added.
Airbus must attack Boeing's monopoly on the large-capacity segment and is studying designs for an A3XX product family which it hopes to launch in 1998 for service in 2003.
It wants to grab at least half of the aircraft market by the end of the decade, up from its estimated historic share of 35 percent. But it lacks large planes to compete with Boeing's 777 giant twinjet and the best-selling 747 jumbo.
The four-nation consortium differs with Boeing over the potential market and development costs for a new large plane.
Airbus forecasts a market of 1,383 planes seating more than 400 passengers over the next 20 years, while Boeing believes demand would only stretch to 470 planes seating 500 or more, which would not allow it to get a return on its money.
A basic A3XX would cost around $200 million, giving potential sales worth more than $275 billion on the Airbus forecast.
""A split market would have been a big challenge for two manufacturers but now Boeing is opting out, that enhances our prospects,"" the Airbus spokesman said.
Airbus accepts the view that the market will fragment further as people want to fly more frequently, non-stop, long distance between city pairs.
The ""fragmentation"" effect was one of the factors cited by Boeing for cutting demand for larger planes and reducing the importance of big airport hubs.
But Airbus believes it will meet that market change with its A340 long-haul plane and that the A3XX will co-exist.
Saturation of air routes and airport landing slots calls for higher capacity planes, it argues. Countering critics who point to already lengthy waits at airports, it says its A3XX designs would allow a quicker passenger turnaround than the jumbo.
Airbus is talking to 14 leading airlines on what the plane should offer and is confident that it can match or better the airlines' operating demands. These include fitting within an 80 metre ""box"" at the airport terminal.
It is officially sticking to its estimated $8 billion development cost for the A3XX, despite scepticism among some experts that it cannot be done for less than $15 billion.
Airbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (part of Daimler-Benz) and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

16,"Some 120 Eurotunnel SA /Plc employees are working round the clock to clear wreckage from the Channel Tunnel, devastated by a fire two weeks ago which has halted passenger services on the undersea link between Britain and France .
Reporters visiting the tunnel on Tuesday viewed a nightmarish scene of flame-scarred concrete where intense heat had blown apart the surface cladding to expose steel reinforcing cables embedded in slabs.
A blaze on a truck-carrying wagon on December 18 forced Eurotunnel to close the tunnel to Eurostar high-speed passenger trains and tourist vehicle Shuttle services just before the Christmas season. Partial freight traffic has been resumed.
Eurotunnel hopes to run two thirds of normal passenger and freight traffic in the estimated three to six months necessary for repairs to be completed, Eurotunnel spokesman Francois Borel said.
""We are going to make a new tunnel,"" he said.
But before repairs can begin, the wreckage must be cleared.
With scorched rubble underfoot and ghostly streams of melted grey fibre glass filaments overhead, maintenance workers in four shifts of six hours are shovelling out ashes and debris, all that is left of 28 trucks caught in the fire.
The Eurotunnel official coordinating the clearance, Dominique Dorso, said three wagons remained where the fire started, in section five of the tunnel. One was being removed Tuesday evening and the other two should be taken out next week.
The fire was so intense in one 30-metre stretch that no visible traces of the trucks themselves remained in the Shuttle wagons, which were themselves reduced to blackened and twisted steel lattice frames.
Chunks exploded off the first 40-cm thick concrete layer which makes up the the Tunnel wall but the fire did not penetrate to the underlying 20-30 cm of injected concrete which lines the link. Behind that second layer is chalk.
Two weeks on, the smell of burnt plastic and metal still permeates the air and protective masks are obligatory.
Once the debris is cleared , the Anglo-French consortium which built the Tunnel, Transmanche Link (TML), can start repairs to the five or six affected kilometres of the link, putting in new cladding, cabling and conductor rails.
Eurotunnel hopes to use intersections linking the two tunnel bores to bypass the damaged section and allow trains to run between Britain and France during repairs, he said.
Tight security surrounds the entry points to the tunnel bores. There are three separate checkpoints before workers can even enter the narrow central service tunnel, which was used for the evacuation on the night of the fire, and is routinely used by maintenance crews.
Specially-built Mercedes vehicles, high and narrow, are used to transport personnel along the service tunnel. It is not a trip for claustrophobics. Once the overhead lights are out, the grey strip of tunnel extends into the darkness ahead, with only the headlights for illumination. Overhead are tonnes of rock and the Channel waters.

16,"Air France is linking up with two major U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines and Continental, in a transatlantic alliance crucial to its ability to keep up with its major European rivals.
The French state airline said on Wednesday it had signed separate letters of intent for cooperation with Delta and Continental after a lengthy search for a U.S. partner.
The long-awaited agreements mark a strategic step in Air France's development and tap the huge U.S. travel market to feed its global network while the U.S. companies will carry the French airline's passengers on their domestic routes.
""These agreements crystallise the company's wish to forge a network of global alliances,"" Air France said in a statement.
The alliances allow so-called code-sharing arrangements between Air France and the U.S. companies, which is a low-cost way of gaining more customers without direct investment.
It means passengers can be issued with a through-ticket by one carrier to be used on its partner airline -- making it possible for airlines to feed passengers to each other without setting up their own routes.
The companies will also harmonise their flight schedules, share a common frequent flyer programme, and provide ground facilities.
Delta operates from its hub at Atlanta, Georgia, while Continental works from Houston, Texas and Air France uses Paris Roissy-Charles De Gaulle airport.
Air France gave no financial details of the link-ups but a spokeswoman said they were expected to bring the loss-making airline savings of $100 million a year.
The airline racked up a net loss of more than two billion francs last year after heavy provisions for restructuring, but has said it hopes to be in profit this financial year.
Air France chairman Christian Blanc has for months been looking for a heavyweight partner to give the airline a global reach and counter the spread of alliances between its rivals.
Air France has previously said it was talking to Continental and Delta, as well as American Airlines of AMR Corp, United Airlines of UAL Corp and USAir Group.
German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG started code-sharing flights with United Airlines in 1994, paving the way for several other high-profile cooperation deals.
American Airlines this year agreed a controversial alliance with British Airways Plc but regulatory approval has been held up by a row between the British and U.S. governments over an ""open skies"" agreement.
The planned BA-American alliance has been attacked by rivals as anti-competitive.
French newspapers have said Washington is squaring up for another struggle with France over a bilateral ""open skies"" pact and would use any alliance by Air France as a lever to push the French to further open up the domestic market.
Air France cautioned the through-ticketing accords with Continental and Delta were subject to government approvals.
Washington and Paris clashed earlier this year when the United States wanted to open bilateral talks on market access and held up U.S. approval of Air France's summer schedule until the French agreed to start negotiations.
Air France and Continental signed a commercial accord back in 1993 but it has never been implemented due to changes in top management at both companies. Continental, among the U.S. majors, does not have a European partner.

16,"Labour unions at beleaguered French carmaker Renault SA said on Monday that they were calling for a one-hour strike at all Renault plants in France, Belgium and Spain.
This was in reaction to an announcement last week that of Renault's Vilvoorde plant near Brussels would close and reports that job will go in France, they said in a statement.
Earlier a Renault spokeswoman said chairman Louis Schweitzer had agreed to meet staff this week at the Belgian plant, where 3,100 jobs will go, but the time and place were not set.
Last Thursday's surprise announcement by the privatised car firm that it would close Vilvoorde stirred a political storm at home and abroad, and a denunciation from Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.
The Renault spokeswoman had no comment on newspaper reports that it was preparing to announce some 3,000 job cuts in France this year. But an industry source said somewhat fewer than 3,000 posts would go in 1997.
An official with the CGT union said Schweitzer was also expected to make a rare appearance at a staff works meeting in France on Thursday.
""Schweitzer has let it be known that he'll explain the situation the company finds itself in on Thursday at an extraordinary staff works council meeting,"" the official with the Communist-led CGT, Renault's biggest union, told Reuters.
Renault's troubles were highlighted by statistics showing new car sales in France slid 24.6 percent last month after tumbling 33.6 percent in January.
The two-month drop reflected the market's weakness since a French state rebate programme, which had underpinned demand, ended in September.
Faced with declining demand and gross overcapacity, Renault is being forced to cut production but must do so without French government support.
With French unemployment at 12.7 percent and a general election due next year, the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe has refused to back a plan to cut 40,000 jobs in the car industry over six years.
French radio and newspapers gave blanket coverage to the labour dispute, with Le Figaro newspaper quoting the economy minister for Belgium's Flemish region as saying the closure was ""an act of economic terrorism"".
Thousands of workers from Renault Belgium, supported by steelworkers, marched through Brussels to protest against the shutdown which is expected to save 825 million French francs ($144 million) a year. Belgian workers called for a Renault boycott.
But on the French stock market, brokers said the company had to reduce output and restructure. Renault stock was down 4.02 percent at 141 francs at 1243 GMT, but that was due to profit-taking as the shares have risen 20 percent since last Wednesday.
""The big problem in the auto sector is overcapacity, a problem which no-one has dared to touch for 20 years for obvious labour reasons,"" said a broker. ""The fact that Renault is tackling it is a good sign.""
Renault shed 1,641 jobs last year and 1,735 in 1995.
Newspapers said charges for the job-cutting plans, on top of an operating loss at the group estimated at two billion francs or more, would result in a full year loss of more than five billion francs for the group in 1996.
The car firm was privatised in stages in 1994 and 1996.
Renault has four assembly plants in France, two in Spain, one in Portugal and one in Slovenia. ($ = 5.718 French Francs)

16,"Even before Cie de Suez  head Gerard Mestrallet has confirmed he is considering a merger with utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux, the market is already betting that he will run the new group.
Brokers, fed by newspaper reports and market rumours, are convinced financial conglomerate Suez and Lyonnaise will merge to create a utilities group with an estimated market capitalisation of 79 billion francs ($13.9 billion) that will give new life to both companies.
A decision on who would head a merged group could play a key role in determining which company gains the upper hand in running the combined entity.
Two elements argue for the merger. Suez, after selling key assets to make good property losses, has a big cash hoard and 50 billion francs in capital -- but little industrial identity.
And at Lyonnaise, chairman Jerome Monod, 66, is preparing his retirement. A merger would not only financially strengthen the company but give fresh leadership.
Odds are heavily in favour of Mestrallet who took over Suez two years ago after a boardroom battle ousted then chairman Gerard Worms. Mestrallet was brought in from Suez's Belgian unit Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB).
""He's the favourite,"" said an analyst, who declined to be named. ""He has done an impressive job.""
""Mestrallet has shown his worth,"" an investment banker said.
He sold key assets including investment bank Banque Indosuez and is credited for bringing Suez back to profit.
The company made a 1995 net attributable loss of 3.96 billion francs, due to provisions for property losses, but analysts expect it to report a 1996 net profit of about 1.15 billion francs.
Mestrallet has narrowed Suez's focus to utilities, held through its Tractebel subsidiary owned by SGB. But the company has been left with an ""identity problem"".
Suez had become a ""piggy bank,"" stuffed with cash and equity capital, while Lyonnaise needs funds to finance its expansion.
Mestrallet, 47, son of a shopkeeper, graduated from the elite Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) and worked as chief of staff to Jacques Delors at the French Finance Ministry before his boss became president of the European Commission.
His rival for power is Guy de Panafieu, the number two to Monod at Lyonnaise.
De Panafieu, 53, is also a graduate of ENA, the fast-track school for senior posts in government and industry. He managed the integration of the troubled Dumez construction firm since its 1990 acquisition by Lyonnaise.
But de Panafieu, although seen as having handled Dumez well, is too closely identified with Monod, the analyst said.
""I do not really see it. He is in Monod's shadow and it is not in the spirit of the times to continue the same line.""
In buying Dumez, Lyonnaise inherited foreign contracts which cost hundreds of millions in provisions as disputes grew. Lyonnaise, already struggling with property losses, had to sell assets to fund provisions for those contract disputes.
""The company has lost time and has sold everything. It does not have a lot of asset support"", said the analyst.
One outside contender is Christine Morin-Postel, who heads Suez's Credisuez unit, and who negotiated the sale of four billion francs of property loans to the Whitehall Street ""vulture fund"" led by broker Goldman Sachs.
The sale, among the biggest in French real estate disposals, is seen as the key to bringing Suez back into profit.
Morin-Postel, 50, also knows Lyonnaise well, having held the international development post and a directorship in the GTM Entrepose construction subsidiary. Last July, British leisure group Rank Organisation Plc made Morin-Postel a non-executive director. ($ = 5.689 French Francs)

16,"Europe's aircraft industry flew closer to strengthening its industrial base with announcements on Friday that a 100-seater jet to be built with China will form part of the Airbus family and Italy's Alenia will enter new Airbus programmes.
The news follows statements earlier this week from archrival Boeing and the smaller McDonnell Douglas that the two U.S. firms are cooperating on future wide-body jets, particularly two ""stretched"" versions of the Boeing 747 jumbo.
""A specific agreement has been reached on the new 100 seat jet family in which all the European partners involved have agreed that it will be part of the Airbus product range,"" a statement from British Aerospace Plc (BAe) said.
BAe is a partner in the European Airbus Industrie consortium, as well as the separate AIA joint venture which is partnering China to build the Asian Express 100 passenger plane.
Airbus, together with Alenia, a unit of the Finmeccanica holding company, will set up a new company to lead the European participation with China and Singapore, the joint statement said.
Singapore's Singapore Technologies Aerospace is also a partner in the project.
""This completes the bottom end of the Airbus range with a brand new offering and consolidates Airbus' position in the growing Asian market,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
The Airbus partners are also bringing Alenia closer to the consortium by involving it in derivatives of current products, such as the A340-600, a stretched version of the four-engine, long-range A340, as well as a likely role in the A3XX large aircraft under study.
""Alenia will probably be a risk-sharing partner in the A3XX,"" the spokesman added. ""It means a broadening in equity and funds for both programmes.""
Airbus has marked out the A340-600 as its top priority as it needs to increase capacity to rival the Boeing 777 twinjet and older 747 models. It also wants to be able to launch the A3XX, expected to cost $8 billion, by 1998 for service in 2003.
But while Alenia is moving in at the programme level, it is not entering the consortium as an equity partner. Alenia is already present in a special Airbus subsidiary, Airbus Military Company, set up to manage the Future Large Aircraft (FLA), a tactical transporter planned for eight European forces.
The other Airbus partners are French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.
The 100-seater plane for China will share common features with the Airbus A320 family, which includes the A321 and A319, seating between 124 and 186 passengers. It will bring Airbus into a new segment fought over by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
News that McDonnell Douglas will act as a subcontractor for Boeing, announced on December 3, ""didn't take us by surprise,"" said the Airbus spokesman. ""It doesn't alter our agenda.""
The aerospace industry had been expecting some of realignment by McDonnell Douglas after it announced at the end of October it was dropping studies of its MDXX wide-body plane. It also lost its place for a vital U.S. competition for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) last month.

16,"French pharmaceuticals and beauty products firm Sanofi on Tuesday posted a 1996 net profit rise of 11 percent, helped by a return to profit in the beauty sector in the second half of the year.
The company announced net earnings for the full year 1996 of 1.74 billion francs ($308 million), compared to 1.58 billion a year ago, on sales of 23.65 billion, which were up three percent.
Earnings per share rose eight percent to 16.80.  Analysts had been expecting an average earnings per share figure of 17.3 francs, according to Edinburg Financial Publishing, and 17.1 francs according to Jacques Chahine Finance in Paris.
The year was ""satisfactory"", finance director Jean-Claude Leroy told a news conference.
It was marked by the continued high level of research efforts. That is right in line with our policy for the short term which is progressing nicely and preparation for the long term through research,"" he added.
Healthcare sales rose five percent but turnover in the beauty segment fell by the same percentage, he said.
The overall profit rise was helped by ""major success in the clinical development of new products in the healthcare sector,"" the group said.
There had been very weak economic growth in Europe, with the exception of Britain, and that had resulted in increased competition, Sanofi said in a statement with its results.
In the beauty segment, selective distribution of luxury goods was hit by that sluggish consumption and sales for the sector fell five percent to 3.8 billion francs on a like-for-like basis from 1995. There were no new beauty product launches last year.
But the sector, after a 74 million loss in the first half, posted operating profit for the second half close to that of the year-ago period. In the full year operating profit was 236 million francs, against 331 million in 1995.
Yves Rocher posted growth in both sales and net earnings while Nina Ricci reported declines in sales and earnings due to difficulties in the industry, Sanofi said.
Leroy said sales of Yves Saint Laurent fell two percent to 2.8 billion francs, while Roger &amp; Gallet's turnover was under 300 million francs. Sales from Oscar de la Renta were above the 300 million level while Van Cleef &amp; Arpels was close to that.
In healthcare, pharmaceutical sales continued to grow in all geographic areas, except in the United States where there was competition from generic products. Diagnostics saw sales up four percent, hindered by difficult market conditions.
Healthcare operating profit rose 5.5 percent to 3.7 billion francs after taking in account higher research and development spending. Research accounted for 16 percent of group turnover.
The year was marked by relative stability of the French franc in comparison with other major world currencies, with the exception of the Japanese yen.
Net debt to equity ratio at the end of 1996 was 11 percent versus 13 percent a year ago. Cashflow rose 12 percent to 3.1 billion francs.
The group, 38-percent held by oil major Elf Aquitaine, had previously forecast a 10 percent rise in 1996 net profit. It gave no forecast for 1997 profit and the 1996 dividend would be set at the board meeting due on March 20.

16,"Air France on Wednesday ordered 10 Boeing jetliners and 10 Airbus jets, and the government-owned airline reported dramatically improved profits of 802 million francs ($158 million) in the first half.
The profit estimate for the six months ending Sept. 30, disclosed in an Air France board statement, compared with a loss of 335 million francs ($66 million) a year ago.
The improved results and Air France's aim to break even in 1996/97 was underlined by the orders for 10 Boeing 777 twinjets and options for 10 more. The airline also ordered five Airbus A340s, confirmed five orders made in June and took options for an additional five.
Air France Chairman Christian Blanc won vital support from French Prime Minister Alain Juppe to buy from Seattle-based Boeing instead of ordering solely from its archrival Airbus Industrie, the European consortium based in southwest France.
At list prices, which are rarely paid, the orders and options for the Boeing 777-200 version ordered could be worth around $2.7 billion. Airbus would stand to gain $1.75 billion.
List prices for the B777-200 range between $128 million and $146 million, while the Airbus A340-300 costs $110 million to $120 million.
""In the reorganization of its fleet, Air France is obliged to buy Boeing,"" Transport Minister Bernard Pons told parliament.
""It is obliged to meet commitments made in 1989 unless it accepts losing deposits and taking legal action, which risks being much more expensive than making this decision.""
The French airline had outstanding Boeing orders worth $994 million and $2 billion in options, Pons said, adding that the airline had skilfully negotiated the latest order to respect the initial commitment.
The three government representatives on the Air France board approved the Boeing 777 purchase ""not because they are the best or the most profitable but because they best meet the company's needs,"" Pons said.
Air France had also accepted to be a launch customer for the planned A340-600, a ""stretched"" version of the A340, he said.
Airbus hopes to build the 375-seater to smash Boeing's monopoly in the large-capacity aircraft segment.
Air France said that, due to financial problems, it froze at the end of 1994 all aircraft orders, including the 1989 Boeing order, and opened talks with the two plane makers.
Air France has since reorganized its fleet, restructured its network around a centralized ""hub"" at Paris Charles De Gaulle airport and optimised aircraft use. It has over the past two years increased the number of flying hours by 14 percent.
Pons welcomed Air France's financial results, saying: ""The results are very encouraging.""

16,"Partners of the Andersen Worldwide professional services business opened a key meeting on Monday to air major differences on how the $11 billion global venture should develop.
The Andersen group covers the Arthur Andersen accounting and audit practice and Andersen Consulting, which specialises in strategic advisory work.
The 2,700 partners are meeting in Paris hoping to resolve problems stemming from the rapid growth of Andersen Consulting and tensions between the two Andersen businesses.
The group posted revenues of $9.5 billion in 1996 and is tracking toward $11 billion by August 1997, an Andersen executive told Reuters recently.
But the rise of the consulting side since it set up as a separate unit in 1989 has fuelled demands for a reorganisation which reflects its wealth and importance within the group.
At stake is how the partnership votes are distributed and fee income is shared out across the Andersen group.
Revenues at the consulting arm have grown between 20-25 percent a year, while the traditional accountancy practice has shown annual growth of 11-13 percent.
The 1996 revenues were split $4.9 billion for consulting and $4.6 billion for accountancy. That was the first time consulting revenues outstripped the accounting side, the executive said. The earnings differential is widening, with consulting expected to bring in $6 billion and accountants $5 billion in 1997.
But there are around 1,650 audit and 1,100 consulting partners, so not only do fewer consulting partners make more money than their accounting colleagues, they have a smaller share of the partners' votes.
Also, under a complex system of worldwide allocation of revenues, the consultants end up effectively transferring wealth to the accountants.
The Paris meeting will air the issues, such as keeping more of the consulting income on that side of the group, the executive said.
""We are not in a crisis,"" the Andersen executive said. ""Revenues and earnings continue to grow year on year."" But there is room for a change in governance, he added.
Among the various options which have been studied are a separation of the two businesses but that radical move was not considered likely. ""I don't think that's most likely,"" he said.
A more gradualist approach might be to streamline the decision-making process. Any proposals which require ""constitutional change"" would require a two-thirds majority of partners in Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting.
Andersen Consulting owes its success to demand from blue-chip firms for management advice, computer-related services and the trend in contracting out administrative jobs traditionally done in-house. Its international corporate identity reflects the global nature of its clients' businesses.
Consulting's rivals includes computer specialists International Business Machines , EDS as well as high-powered management consultants such as McKinsey.
The Arthur Andersen accountancy, set up in Chicago in 1913, is one of the so-called Big Six practices. It draws on a customer base of mid-sized firms, and member firms have a strong national identity in the 79 countries in which it has offices.
The Paris meeting, part of an 18-month cycle of partners' gatherings, will be the last with Lawrence Weinbach as managing partner and chief executive, as he is stepping down in August.

34,"Czech surgeons began exploratory surgery on President Vaclav Havel on Monday to remove a spot from his lung, but the former dissident playwright has said that his health was not in serious danger.
Havel's office announced in a statement that a news briefing would be held on Monday afternoon after the operation but an official said it was impossible to say how the long the surgery would last.
Havel, a heavy smoker who spent almost five years in communist jails, has been ill for several weeks.
But in his weekly radio address, broadcast on Sunday, he was in an optimistic mood, saying the operation would ""remove some sort of bad point or spot found on my lungs, the character of which is still unknown"".
""However, even if it is something bad, it is so small and its location is so favourable that it seems that I am in no serious danger,"" he said in the address, recorded on Friday.
Havel, who led the 1989 ""Velvet Revolution"" which overthrew communism, said in the address from his hospital bed: ""I am here not because my state of health is worsening"".
""On the contrary, never in the past few weeks have I felt as well as I feel just now.""
Havel, who is widely respected at home and abroad, was admitted to hospital last Monday, more than a week after his office said he was suffering from pneumonia. Later surgeons described the planned surgery as ""medium serious"".
The Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that a sample of the spot would be sent for immediate analysis during the operation. Based on the results, surgeons would decide whether to continue with the operation, it said without elaborating.
Havel will keep his full presidential responsibilities during the operation.
Under the Czech constitution, most executive power lies with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus who is attending the European security summit in Lisbon in Havel's place.
Havel's power lies more in his personal authority and reputation for honesty in a Czech political scene increasingly dominated by squabbling and allegations of impropriety.
Opinion polls show his popularity rating at around 80 percent while public disillusionment with Czech politics is widespread.
Turnout for elections to the new Senate last month was just 30 percent in the second round, and a poll published last week showed that 58 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the state of Czech politics.
Havel, whose wife Olga died of cancer in January, supports the free market but has bitterly criticised the corruption, dishonesty and materialism which has accompanied the scramble to make money.

34,"A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:
Journalist: ""Could you please tell me Mr. Novak's first name.""
Secretary (with no hesitation): ""Doctor.""
Czechs are obsessed with academic titles.
It was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained ""Doctor of Law"" which forced him to resign from cabinet on Tuesday in a shocking mea culpa on the floor of parliament.
""In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree,"" Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute, said.
Normal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as ""Mr. Engineer"" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or ""Mr. Doctor"", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers to PhD'd journalists.
Kalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.
His resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised ""JUDr"" moniker in campaign material and biographies.
Apart from Kalvoda, only one resigned from parliament, the three others so far have refused.
""I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have,"" said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of ""Dr."" for this story.
The Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title -- Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD) -- but he does not inisist on its use by others.
Some of title-envy stems from four decades of communism which ended with 1989's bloodless ""Velvet Revolution"" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.
Communist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.
Kalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.
The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml - a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.
The daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.
Havel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and never was allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.
""He made himself a name, not a title,"" Lidove Noviny wrote.

34,"Volkswagen AG Czech unit Skoda Auto a.s. said on Monday its new mid-sized ""Octavia"" sedan will list on its home market at a base price of 335,700 crowns, at the low end of its class.
At a media presentation at the plant north of Prague, marketing chief Detlef Wittig said Skoda will make 64,000 Octavias next year, and raise production of the line to 90,000 in 1998.
The new model, built on a common VW platform designed for the 1998 Audi A3 and upgraded Golf, will be available with three petrol and two diesel engines in three lines, with the top-of-the-line SLX automatic model priced at 497,900 crowns.
The Octavia will get its international test at the Paris International Auto Show in October and should be delivered to Czech dealers in November, followed by launches on foreign markets where prices have yet to be determined.
Skoda was taken over by Volkswagen in 1992 under a governemnt privatisation plan. The company built an entirely new factory for Octavia production.
Continuing the break from the boxy Communist-era Skodas, the Octavia has more modern but conservative lines, somewhere between a Ford Mondeo and Audi's A-line.
Skoda is hoping to build on the success of its Felicia economy five-door hatchback by offering an affordable middle-range sedan and take back chunks of its home market lost to Czechs seeking a more western-looking status symbol.
""Octavia... is a logical step from Felicia into a higher market segment,"" said Wittig.
The cheapest Octavia includes a 1.6 litre, 55 Kw engine, ignition immobiliser, driver-side airbag, plus an adjustable driver's seat and steering wheel.
More expensive versions will be alternatively equipped with a 1.6/74 kw, 20-valve 1.8/92 kw engine, 1.9/66 kw turbodiesel or 1.9/50 kw diesel engine, and an optional passenger-side airbag.
Side-body airbags should be available in mid-1997.
Wittig told reporters that Octavia should help Skoda's total production to rise to 350,000 units next year and 400,000 at the turn of the century after 251,000 cars made this year.
""Within the (VW) concern, Skoda takes the position of the counterweight to the Asian producers,"" he added.
Skoda Chairman Ludvik Kalma said that he expected about 20,000 Octavias to be sold annually on the domestic market, the rest being exported to the rest of Europe and overseas.
The company lost 1.621 billion crowns last year due to heavy investments into the new factory, but Kalma said the firm should come close to breaking even this year.

34,"The Czech government gave its final approval on Wednesday to a 20-year contract for natural gas supplies from Norway, ending total dependence on Russian gas, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said.
""The government today gave its final approval to the Norwegian option of diversifying imports of natural gas including the diversification of the transport route,"" Dlouhy told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.
The deal, approved by Czech and Norwegian ministers last month, angered officials at Russia's gas company RAO Gazprom which called the move economically unjustified.
Financial details have not been disclosed, but the Norwegian gas is expected to cost more than Russian supplies.
A consortium of Norwegian firms, including Statoil, Norsk Hydro ASA and Saga Petroleum A/S, is involved in the deal, though Norway must still decide which gas producing platforms will supply the Czechs.
Under the deal which begins on May 1, supplies would start at 1.4 million cubic metres a day, increasing to about three billion cubic metres annually.
The total supply as laid out by the agreement should be 53 billion cubic metres (bcm) over 20 years.
The Norwegian gas is to be delivered through a pipeline via northern Germany which feeds into the Czech Republic.
Czechs, who for the past half century have taken all of their natural gas from Russia, now consume around nine bcm of gas per year. Total consumption is expected to rise to 12-13 bcm after the turn of the century.
Russia's Gazprom is still expected to remain the main supplier to the Czechs, but Gazprom officials said last month the Norwegian incursion could hurt Gazprom's competitive position in Europe.
""Gazprom is closely following the development of events in the Czech Republic, and remaining its fundamental partner in the field of gas supplies, will do everything possible to widen co-operation,"" Gazprom said.
Prague said it picked Norway after considering potential deals with German, Dutch and British suppliers, as well as a second delivery route of Russian gas.
The deal also signals an expected push in the sector by Norway into central and eastern Europe. Statoil officials said at an initialling of the agreement last month in Prague that it was also looking to supply Poland and Hungary with natural gas.

34,"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that improving the regulation of beleaguered Czech capital markets was on his agenda, but he took a shot at critics who have said the improvement was coming too slowly.
Speaking at a banking and finance forum in Prague, Klaus said that ""we are searching for new forms of regulations"".
""But I disagree with those critics, mostly foreigners, who look at the existing quality of our capital markets and are surprised that they do not equal Wall Street, the City of London or any other well-established western financial centre yet,"" Klaus told the conference.
""Their high-brow attitude and and their absolutist, almost doctrinal phraseology"" does not help much, he said.
However Klaus, a professor of economics and fierce anti-regulation campaigner, added that finding the right extent of capital market regulation was an ""imminent task"".
Many foreign equity analysts and investors frequently criticise the Czech markets for a lack of quality company information and clear pricing of shares, insider trading, and poor oversight of numerous investment funds.
Many analysts use Poland and its more stringent capital market regulation as an example of why the Warsaw Stock Exchange attracts much more foreign investment than Prague.
Separately, Klaus said that the country had too many banks and investment funds, and many were poorly managed.
A crisis in small private banks peaked last year when Agrobanka, the fifth largest and the largest fully-private bank, was put under forced administration by the central bank, the last and largest in a dozen recent interventions.
Klaus said a liberal approach to granting banking and capital markets licences in the early 1990's came from the need for more private financial houses and competition, and nobody knew what the right number of institutions would be.
""We have too many banks and too many investment funds now, and we also know that not all of them function perfectly or are in the best possible hands,"" Klaus said.
The Finance Ministry's capital markets oversight office has recently stepped up its activity with a wave of actions against illegal asset-stripping by managers of mostly smaller Czech investment funds.
But the ministry is still under fierce criticism from investors and the media for a lack of activity.
Klaus has revealed a plan to gradually separate capital market supervision from the Finance Ministry, a process which was started in February by creating a separate Securities Bureau within the ministry.
Under the plan, the Czech Securities Registry started publishing over-the counter trades registred at the centre earlier this year.
Klaus also admitted that a period at the start of the privatisation process in the early 1990's when state firms were not yet privatised led to a loss of many assets as state supervision relaxed but new owners were still not in place.
""This is something what the future privatising countries should avoid,"" Klaus told the conference.

34,"A U.S.-led consortium won a controversial Czech Defence Ministry tender on Thursday, but its American rival Unisys Corp immediately said it would appeal the decision.
Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny announced that the consortium led by Electronic Data Systems Corp and Digital Equipment Corp had won a 1.3 billion crown ($44 million) information systems contract.
The battle to supply the system, which will help Czech armed forces to become compatible with the NATO alliance, has been long and bitter.
Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender last August. But the tender was later cancelled when Czech competition authorities found irregularities in the process.
Vyborny said a commission set up to evaluate binds in the latest tender had actually put Unisys narrowly ahead of EDS-Digital. But the ministry had decided to ignore its recommendation due to the consortium's lower price and greater experience, he told an news conference.
Jan Vesely, director of the Czech unit of Unisys, said his company would first appeal directly to the ministry. ""In the event of a negative answer, there is the Economic Competition Office,"" he said.
Unisys said the EDS bid did not cover all the components which were required. EDS officials in Prague declined to comment and ministry officials were not contactable.
A number of other Czech military tenders have been marked by controversy, sometimes amid allegations of graft.
Installation of the staff information system is a large step on the Czech army's path to compatibility with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's military command.
NATO leaders will decide in July which former communist countries will be invited to join the alliance. The Czech Republic is a front runner along with Poland and Hungary.
Vyborny said EDS-Digital had put in a bid of 1.295 billion crowns while Unisys was nearly 109 million crowns more expensive.
The tender commission, which rated the bids but was not authorised to take any decision, put Unisys marginally ahead of EDS. Both were well ahead of International Business Machines Corp and Deloitte and Touche unit IDOM.
""(The bids of) two companies, Unisys and EDS, are in technical terms almost identical. In price terms, without question, the best bid was submitted by EDS,"" Vyborny said. ""The experience of EDS-Digital with staff information systems is greater. It is a bid offering a well-tested system which EDS has implemented in 14 NATO countries,"" he added.
Unisys said it was suspicious that the original tender was abolished and rankings were changed when it won again.
""We consider this decision on ranking in the public tender to be unobjective and unjustified, and we will surely appeal against it,"" the Unisys statement said. ($ = 29.46 Czech Crowns)

34,"Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Tuesday said the 1997 Czech state budget, to be presented to the full cabinet in September, plans an overall spending increase of 11.8 percent.
Speaking to reporters after a working session of economics ministers, Klaus also said he did not expect inflation to fall below eight percent next year.
The monetarist economist Klaus, who has said a balanced budget is the ""Alpha and Omega"" of his government, said spending increases would be largest in percentage terms for export supports, regional transportation, and housing.
He said the total expenditure side next year would rise 58 billion czech crowns ($2.21 billion) over expected 1996 spending to 549 billion crowns. The ministers were to discuss the revenue side of the budget later in September.
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said the full cabinet should get the full draft for discussion on September 20. When asked if there was talk among ministers of anything excpet a balanced budget Kocarnik replied tersely ""No"".
The government's draft budget has traditionally been debated and passed by mid-December.
Klaus's government has passed four straight balanced budgets, although it will discuss a plan on Wednesday to cut 1996 spending by another 9.3 billion crowns in order to balance this year's ledger.
Klaus said the expenditure figures were still subject to further discussion but he did not expect major changes. Fixed manadatory expenditures are forecast rising by 14.0 percent while discressionary spending would rise 9.9 percent.
Klaus added that state sector wages were planned to rise a nominal 12.4 percent in 1997, and he hoped that it would set an example for private sector budget planning.
""(The government) wants to send a message which would lead to a certain stoppage of the pace of wage increases also in the non-budget (private sector) sphere,"" Klaus said.
Earlier this month the central bank warned of inflationary wage rises not being matched by increases in productivity.
Klaus also said that he did not expect 1997 inflation to fall below eight percent, which was the government's target for lowering inflation in 1996.
""Unfortunately we don't expect a number lower than eight (percent),"" he said.
He did not elaborate on if he meant average or year-on-year inflation. For budget purposes, however, the government usually speaks in terms of average inflation.
Czech year-on-year inflation stood at 9.4 percent in July, while the moving average stood at 8.6 percent.
The government in passing the 1996 budget forecast inflation for the year of roughly eight percent, but strong domestic demand has kept prices higher.

34,"Wider trading in shares of the fast-growing Czech chemical and trade conglomerate Chemapol Group a.s. began this month with a whimper, and analysts see the stock hampered by opaque financial disclosure.
They said the still illiquid stock -- which first listed on the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) last Thursday at 2,290 crowns ($82.76), dipped to 2,170 this week before Friday's fixing at 2,245 -- faced uncertainty because of recent acquisitions.
""The problem is information, we don't know where acquisitions were financed from, we haven't seen the balance sheet from last year,"" said Jan Zak of Atlantik Financial Markets.
Chemapol spent an estimated 12 billion crowns in an acquisition spree last year. It now controls about 70 companies with combined equity of about 20 billion crowns.
Analysts agreed it was potentially an interesting stock, but much more transparency was needed.
Anna Bossong, analyst at ING Barings, said Chemapol would have trouble with a planned 600 million crown issue of global depository receipts (GDR) expected later this year if the company is not more forthcoming.
""I think it would be very difficult. One of the problems this company has is a difficulty with transparency. Increased transparency would be the first thing foreign investors look to before they would invest into GDRs,"" Bossong told Reuters.
Chemapol originally planned the issue for the last year, but then delayed it, saying domestic investors had already sufficient demand for the nominal 826 million crowns in new shares issued last autumn.
Most of the new issue was gobbled up by existing shareholders which includes six major local banks -- Komercni Banka, Ceska sporitelna, IPB, Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, Agrobanka and Union Banka -- and management.
Only a handful of shares have traded on the PSE since it was listed last week.
Chemapol's empire grew from an oil trading company -- a business it partially lost to local refineries -- to include major chemical companies, a small airline, a publishing house, an arms trading firm and sports franchises and clubs.
It is also competing in a tender for a more than one-third stake in the largest Czech defence firm, the debt-strapped jet maker Aero Vodochody a.s.
Chemapol's spokesman Vadim Petrov said the conglomerate is aiming to improve the information flow. ""That is a process we are working on intensively,"" he said.
It has yet to reveal 1996 results. Petrov said they would be released when an audit is finished, probably in April.
On January 1, the firm adopted a new structure creating sub-holdings grouping its distribution, trading, chemical, communications and real estate holdings.
""The new structure is quite good... the sub-holding arrangement is logical and the acquisitions, especially in the chemical industry, logically chain on,"" said Atlantik's Zak.
But Ondrej Vojtech of Akro Capital warned: ""The acquisition policy is known to be too broad-minded, and I have the feeling that they are trying to get money from everywhere.""
Petrov said this year Chemapol would try to stabilise and consolidate its holdings, and is not planning any large acquisitions, apart from the potential Aero stake.
The group posted audited net profit of 62.5 million crowns in 1995. It had total sales of over 40 billion crowns in 1995 and 29 billion crowns in the first half of 1996.

34,"Bitter infighting broke out among Czech Social Democrats on Friday only a month before elections in which the opposition party hopes to humiliate conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
Party chairman Milos Zeman denied there was any split in his party, which is running neck and neck with Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) before Senate elections next month.
But almost in the same breath he threatened to resign next spring unless a party deputy chairman who broke ranks to vote with the Klaus government last week went first.
Adding to his woes, a Social Democrat deputy threatened to leave the parliamentary party in a row with an ex-communist colleague, a move which could tip the balance of parliamentary power between the minority government and opposition.
Klaus, whose three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority in lower house elections earlier this year, has seemed under heavy pressure with opinion polls showing the Social Democrats level or slightly ahead of his ODS.
But just as the Social Democrats seemed in with a good chance of beating the ODS for the first time since the restoration of democracy, strife flared in opposition ranks.
Last week Jozef Wagner, the chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, led a revolt by four Social Democrat deputies which allowed the 1997 state budget to pass its first reading.
Tempers flared on Friday after Wagner threatened to resign from the parliamentary party unless another Social Democrat deputy, ex-communist Michal Kraus, quit the budget committee and a parliamentary commission investigating a bank collapse.
Despite the appearance of disarray in Social Democrat ranks, Zeman played down Wagner's threat. ""There is no real split. I do not want to overestimate the importance of his proclamation in this case,"" he told a news conference.
""A split would happen only if a body of opinion formed which was sharply different in questions of principle from the opinion of the party leadership,"" he said.
But then he attacked party deputy chairman Karel Machovec, one of the Wagner rebels. ""There should not be a person in the leadership who shows himself up by talking about disputes in the party,"" said Zeman.
Asked if he would resign if Machovec remained vice chairman after a party congress scheduled for next March, Zeman said: ""Yes. It is true, I can confirm that.""
Kraus, a communist deputy before the 1989 collapse of the East Bloc, accused the four budget rebels of being ""corrupted politically"" by the Klaus coalition.
Wagner told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes he would leave the Social Democratic parliamentary party or ""club"" if Kraus did not go. Machovec was quoted by local media as saying that if Wagner left, there would be a serious party split.
This could change the balance of power in the 200-seat lower house where the Social Democrats, along with the little-reformed Communists and the far-right Republicans, have 101 votes to the government's 99.
The Senate itself has few powers. But the elections on November 15 and 16, with a second round runoff a week later, have become a test of public opinion which could indicate whether early lower house elections are likely.
Analysts say that if the Social Democrats perform strongly, Zeman might be tempted to bring down the coalition to force lower house polls in which his party might overtake Klaus's ODS. But that depends on Zeman being able to maintain discipline.
So far voters do not seem concerned. A poll taken by the STEM agency before and after the budget vote showed the Social Democrats with 27.3 percent support ahead of ODS with 26.8.
In the lower house elections on May 31-June 1, ODS won 29.6 percent and the Social Democrats 26.4.

37,"NatWest Markets said on Monday that its senior management did not know about the interest rate options pricing problem until three days before the losses were made public.
""Senior management did not know until February 25 that there was potentially something of significance,"" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.
She denied a weekend newspaper report suggesting that NatWest, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc knew of the losses some time before they were revealed.
The mispricings, which on Thursday NatWest revealed had totalled 90 million pounds ($144 million), had come to light during the course of normal pricing reviews and it had not been able to put a price on the loss until February 28, when NatWest estimated it at 50 million pounds.
The initial discovery of the loss came to light through a more intensive review across the investment bank's trading areas, but it was a month or so before the extent of the mispricings became clear.
The options losses have been a painful and embarrassing episode for NatWest Markets and its chief executive Martin Owen, who on Thursday said he would forgo 200,000 of a 500,000 pound bonus as a result of the affair.
NatWest confirmed a report that the girlfriend of Kyriacos Papouis, the former NatWest options trader whom NatWest wants to interview about the losses, also worked for the bank but was employed in derivatives marketing and had nothing to do with Papouis's work.
She had been given a holiday period because of the situation, the spokeswoman added.
Papouis, who left NatWest for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns, has not commented on the losses. Since the affair came to light he has also resigned from Bear Stearns.
He and five others have been reported to British financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and the Bank of England is also looking into what went wrong at the bank.
NatWest Markets' global head of options, Neil Dodgson, who was suspended from the firm more than two weeks ago when the losses first came to light, is among those who will come under SFA scrutiny.
The others suspended last week were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives, and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets.
While the group has maintained that it does not believe any of its clients suffered losses as a result of the options mispricing, which went back as far as 1994, the spokeswoman declined to comment on whether NatWest would try to recoup any gains made by counterparties to any wrongly priced deals.
""We haven't determined that that is an issue,"" she said.
She dismissed suggestions that morale was low at the bank following last week's revelation that the loss was nearly twice as large as initially thought, the suspension of four senior staff and the cutting of bonuses to a handful of individuals.
""We are doing really good business here, and we continue to do good business. Everybody wants this to be dealt with properly and put behind us,"" she said.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which investigates and prosecutes major and complex financial crime, has been contacted by NatWest but has not begun an investigation.

37,"British property company Greycoat is unlikely to crumble under pressure from rebel shareholders who want it broken up or succumb to a merger approach from smaller rival Moorfield Estates, analysts said on Monday.
""I don't think they are on the critical list in any sense or meaning of the word,"" one analyst said.
A proposal to sell-off Greycoat's assets is due to be put to shareholders at a special meeting on Thursday. It has been put forward by the UK Active Value Fund, which is advised by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisers.
UK Active Value Fund bought its 11 percent stake in Greycoat three years ago, rescuing it from receivership. But Myerson's relationship with the firm's management has not run smoothly.
The South African financier's challenge to the Greycoat management has also triggered a proposal by Moorfield Estates involving a share exchange offer for the larger Greycoat, which has so far dismissed the approach.
Moorfield said in a statement on Monday that it had ""developed a proposal to add value for all shareholders through a strategy of more active management of the assets of Greycoat"".
It said this had been presented to some of Greycoat's larger shareholders, accounting for close to 40 percent of the shares, and an approach had then been made to Greycoat's chairman.
They include merging the two companies by a share exchange and restructuring the assets of the enlarged group.
This would involve a Central London portfolio made up initially of Greycoat's main assets, Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, which would later be demerged.
Moorfield also intends setting up a portfolio of ""investment and development property earmarked for immediate disposal to a major property company"".
The remainder of the enlarged group would constitute ""an investment, trading and development portfolio"" and there would be a reorganisation of the management structure to reduce costs by ""at least 1.5 million pounds ($2.47 million) per annum"", Moorfield said.
While analysts agreed the Moorfield plan was unlikely to succeed, some said there was an opportunity for Greycoat to take over another company with higher profitability so the combined company could capitalise on Greycoat's favourable tax position.
""But they are not going to be flushed out by Thursday,"" a second property analyst told Reuters, adding that three or four companies had looked ""very seriously"" at the possibility of joining with Greycoat.
Another possibility would be a larger group such as British Land sweeping up Greycoat, although such an outcome seems remote in the short-term, analysts said.
Myerson's proposed sale of Greycoat's London property assets is seen by some as an unwise ""forced sale"" which would not achieve shareholder value in what is an improving market.
""Generally speaking a forced sale of their assets would not gain anything in the short term,"" the first analyst said, adding that with rental growth starting to show through, it made sense to hold onto Greycoat's two largest properties.
""They are vulnerable to any change in market conditions, but it would be a mistake to be forced into a corner and to sell something in a relatively short timescale. It would be totally counterproductive,"" he added.
But others said the time was right to sell off Greycoat's largest assets. ""This is exactly the right time of the cycle (to sell,"" the second analyst said.
Greycoat shares closed 6.5 pence higher at 155.5 pence while Moorfield shares were unchanged at 30.5 pence. ($1=.6069 Pound)

37,"Financial services and property group Liberty International Holdings on Thursday unveiled a move into the British pensions market in ventures involving the British Telecom Pension Scheme and pension fund management group Hermes.
Liberty is establishing its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, which will target both the needs of money purchase pension schemes and retail pensions.
BT Pension Scheme, which owns Hermes, is to pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions, with the rest held by Liberty.
Liberty and Hermes said in a joint statement they were also setting up a new subsidiary called Hermes Liberty International Pensions to offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager.
BT Pension Scheme is giving the Hermes Liberty joint venture ""critical mass from the outset"" with a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds, Liberty's chairman Donald Gordon said.
Gordon said Liberty was ""well positioned to take advantage of the changes affecting the UK pensions industry."" Hermes' expertise in investment management and track record would help it to provide quality and competitively priced pension services.
David Fischel, Liberty's managing director, said Liberty International Pensions still required approval of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry but was otherwise ready for launch.
Hermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds.
""Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems...and the administration. We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that's a very good marriage,"" Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said.
Ross Goobey said Hermes had approached Liberty International only to find the group had been considering an approach to Hermes.
""It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us.""
He said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.
The decision by the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme to transfer assets to the new Hermes Liberty International Pensions funds would give the new venture a boost.
""I would hope it gives some people some feeling of security that BT Pension Scheme, which is after all the biggest in the country, is willing to do this,"" he said.
Liberty plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said.
Fischel said an announcement would be made on exactly how the retail customer business would work at a future date, adding he could not give details at present. ($1=.6395 Pound)

37,"Mention moneylending to most Britons and their instant reaction is ""you mean loan-sharks!"".
But Britain's established credit companies, which lend to people unable to borrow from the high street banks or credit card companies, say the public image of menacing debt collectors is a far cry from how they conduct their regulated business.
""We are credit collectors. A debt collector is someone who has no relationship with the customer. It's a totally different process,"" says Eddie Cran, chief executive of the financial services group Cattle's, which runs door-to-door moneylenders Shopacheck.
Such firms are tied closely to the wheeling and dealing of the City of London. Provident Financial, Cattle's and London Scottish Bank are all publicly quoted, profitable firms paying shareholders annual dividends.
People who borrow from them may have had minor civil court judgements against them, be unemployed or simply not want to have bank accounts or credit cards. The firms provide a service others -- except for unregulated outfits -- will not, and while it won't cost a pound of flesh, it is not cheap.
To those used to credit cards or in-store credit the rates may appear outrageously high. But credit companies point out they include major costs such as collection and insurance, are agreed in advance and do not rise if a payment is missed.
So while interest rates may be at all-time lows, these service charges mean the APRs (annualised percentage rate) can exceed 150 percent. To borrow 100 pounds ($167) over 25 weeks from Shopacheck with a five pound weekly repayment costs 25 pounds.
Shopacheck, which started in the 1930s in northeast England, has 2,800 agents. Its average loan is for six months, the average amount 150 pounds and average indebtedness 350 pounds.
STREET COLLECTING
Only a few miles from the City, but a million miles from its hefty salaries and bonuses, Kathy, a self-employed agent for Shopacheck, does her weekly door-to-door collection of debt repayments through the streets of northwest London.
The terraced suburban houses at which she stops are remarkably average. Most have front gardens, some are neatly laid out with blooming rose bushes while others are less well-kept, with tatty patches of litter-strewn grass.
Inside there are the usual consumer trappings of late 1990s British life.
Televisions, video-recorders, washing machines and microwave ovens, even the odd fish tank, are all in evidence, especially when crammed into a small council flat along with children, their toys, pets and piles of ironing.
At each house Kathy, a 37-year-old mother of three, collects sums ranging from two pounds fifty to 20 pounds.
Some customers take loans in the form of vouchers which can be spent only at certain high street shops, while others use the retail service offered by Shopacheck and buy items such as bed linen, beds or barbeques from the firm's own catalogue.
Most of her clients seem to welcome her as a friend, they expect her visits and have the money ready to hand to her. Kathy says that, after eight years, she is a treated as a long-standing family friend or agony aunt by many of them.
Only at one home does the son of the house come to the door and tell Kathy that his mother isn't in. ""Fine, can you tell her I'll see her as usual next week,"" says Kathy.
But getting money back isn't always this easy.
Kathy admits that if a customer threatens her, she passes the problem back to the company, which says it instructs its self-employed agents not to take personal risks.
MONEYLENDERS PLUG GAP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES
""The one thing about credit is that it is easy to give but much harder to get back,"" says Paul Oliver, a Shopacheck regional manager who has been in the business for 27 years as customer, agent and manager.
He is not alone as a successful businessman who has made use of Britain's long-standing system of moneylending. The managing director of one British bank confided he would not be where he is today had it not been for a money lending firm.
His family could not afford to buy him a suit for an interview. He took a loan, bought the essential attire, got his first job and set himself on the path to greater things.
Oliver says nine out of 10 times business is conducted with the woman of the house and although bad debts are expected, they only reach about four percent a year, which is good going for a business the mainstream lenders won't touch because of the risk.
A recent television documentary showed some moneylenders breaking rules laid down by the Consumer Credit Act. Oliver says he deals harshly with anyone who steps outside the rules.
For Cran firms such as his are plugging a gap in Britain's financial services marketplace and he is keen to correct what he sees as ""untrue perceptions"" about the business. ""What we are actually attempting to do is to deal with customers who cannot get credit through the mainstream lenders,"" Cran told Reuters.
""It (door-to-door lending) is very high cost and very personal. We have to train people to look after a number of customers,"" he added. A customer who fails to pay is only pursued through the courts ""as a very last measure"" and only in ""very extreme circumstances"" is an outside firm called in.
Cran says Cattle's target market is about five-and-a-half million people, around two million of whom need the discipline of an agent calling to collect every week.
But the stigma involved means Cattle's also offers Welcome, a loans service for people who have bank accounts and pay by direct debit. This ""requires a very high rejection rate and an in-depth granting procedure"", Cran says.
SHAREHOLDERS REAP THE DIVIDENDS
For Cattle's and its competitors credit is a lucrative business. In September it reported increased pre-tax profits for the first six months of the year of nearly 15.0 million pounds. In 1995 its shareholders received a total dividend of 6.9 pence.
In August Provident Financial, the sector's biggest player, reported first half pre-tax profits of 47.5 million pounds. It said it had seen continued growth in home collected credit and was confident of a ""good result"" for the year as a whole.
But for customers, things might not be so rosy. While most manage to pay back their loans, some do not. Kathy soon spots trouble. ""You can see they are struggling if they start having to scrabble around for pennies,"" she says. ($1=.5990 Pound)

37,"Former Barings executive Ron Baker plans to bring a counter-claim in a lawsuit against him by Dutch bank ING Barings for repayment of a loan he is alleged to have received, his lawyer told Reuters on Friday.
""He (Baker) plans to bring in his own counter-claim into those proceedings and they will be heard together unless some sort of arrangement is reached beforehand,"" Lindsay Hill, a partner at London law firm Fox Williams said.
ING Barings last month confirmed it was suing Baker for 113,000 pounds ($185,800), representing a 100,000 pound loan allegedly given to Baker when he was at Barings, plus interest.
British merchant bank Barings collapsed in February 1995 amid losses of around $1.4 billion run up by the unauthorised derivatives trades of Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson. It was rescued by ING which formed ING Barings as its investment banking arm.
Leeson is currently serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence in Singapore for his part in the bank's downfall.
But the saga looks set to run on for some time, with writs filed by administrators of the bank against the former auditors and subsequent third party proceedings being issued against former bosses, including Baker.
Hill said Baker would contest the ING Barings case against him and his counter-claim would be for an unpaid bonus.
""He believes that the monies that he was promised by way of bonus remain due and are outstanding so yes, they will come into the equation in terms of resolving the dispute with ING Barings,"" Hill said.
Baker would not be the first to attempt to force ING Barings to pay a bonus which had apparently been promised before the collapse of Barings itself and ING's takeover.
But Hill said the decision by a London industrial tribunal on Thursday to reject a claim by another former Barings executive for an allegedly unpaid bonus had no implications for Baker's case.
""It's a different case, it's for different sums of money and the circumstances are not the same,"" Hill said.
Mary Walz, who was global head of equity financial products at Barings Investment Bank, had her 500,000 pound claim, which she said she was told was ""set in stone"" by her former Barings bosses, thrown out by the tribunal.
Hill declined to say how much Baker's counter-claim would be for but said the sum was ""substantial"".

37,"Britain's NatWest Bank revealed on Thursday its multi-million pound derivatives losses were nearly twice as large as first thought and that they began in 1994.
A wide-ranging probe into the loss also led to drastic action, including suspension of four senior employees and the withdrawal of millions of pounds in staff bonuses.
NatWest said the total loss was 90 million pounds ($144 million) but that five million had already been provisioned and eight million had been clawed back by not paying the bonuses, making a loss of 77 million pounds in the accounts. And Martin Owen, chief executive of the NatWest Markets investment banking division, will forego 200,000 of his 500,000 pounds 1996 bonus in a gesture to the industry.
""He has waived his bonus in recognition of his overall responsibility for the business. He believes he has made the gesture as an example to the industry,"" a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.
Owen said it was unacceptable that the losses, which had resulted from options being wrongly priced systematically but stemmed from an initial interest rate options loss, had not been unearthed earlier. He said the problem came to light as a result of procedural changes to the way trading positions and valuations are checked. ""It has gone on (during) a long period; that is clearly unacceptable against the background of incidents in other firms as well. Fortunately, it does seem to be isolated to this area,"" Owen said. Although his role has come under scrutiny, NatWest's overall head Derek Wanless told Reuters he had complete confidence in Owen but the loss had been a setback for him in one area. The bank would learn lessons and emerge stronger, he added.
The staff suspensions, which have been notified to Britain's financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), followed the suspension of global head of options Neil Dodgson when the problem first came to light nearly two weeks ago.
A former NatWest options trader, Kyriacos Papouis, has also been reported to the SFA, which confirmed it was examining the conduct of all six. NatWest said its requests to interview Papouis had so far been ignored.
The initial findings of NatWest's inquiry, carried out by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines, found no flaws in the models used to calculate valuations.
Owen said details of how the mispricings went unnoticed for so long would be examined in the second phase of an internal inquiry.
He could not say if the initial options loss was the result of an individual's actions and could not comment on whether the subsequent mispricings had been intentional. ""I don't want to prejudge the second phase of the report because we are really deep into the examination of all the individuals associated with it. The degree to which there was collusion or not is something which is being examined,"" he said.
But further disciplinary action could follow from the report's second stage, he said.
Those suspended were Ian Gaskell, head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe, Christophe Lanson, global head of rate risk management, Jean-Francois Nguyen, managing director of debt derivatives and Phil Wise, chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets. NatWest stressed these suspensions were normal practice in such cases and did not imply guilt. Peter Hall, President and Chief Operating Officer of NatWest Markets, will temporarily take on the additional responsibilities of Chief Administrative Officer. Vincent Tomasi currently Senior Vice President and Head of US Debt Capital Markets at NatWest Markets in New York will take over as acting Head of Global Debt Derivatives. The bank said that a new management structure it had intended to put into place following its 1996 acquisition of U.S. bond trading house Greenwich Capital and the creation of a global debt markets division would now be accelerated. NatWest is continuing to keep bank regulator the Bank of England closely informed, and the second phase of the inquiry would take place as quickly as possible, concentrating on the role of individuals, Owen said.

37,"Britain's Takeover Panel, after battling to defend its policing role of London's busy mergers and acquisitions market against European interference, has ended the year in the spotlight over its handling of CE Electric's bid for Northern Electric.
The non-statutory body has spent much of 1996 campaigning against a framework European Union proposal on takeover bids which it says will lead to multi-million pound lawsuits and harm London's system of takeover regulation.
But on Monday the panel's own role was under scrutiny as the outcome of a bitter bid battle between U.S. group CE and British utility Northern hung in the balance.
""What is going on at the moment is being watched pretty closely. It is a fairly unique situation,"" a financial services lawyer said.
Criticism of the part the panel has played stems from a 250,000 pound ($418,600) payment made by Northern to one of its advisors, BZW, the investment banking arm of British banking giant Barclays Plc.
BZW said this was a discretionary fee and denied that it was linked to its purchase last week of Northern shares, which had already been allowed by the panel. After it was told of the payment, the panel extended the deadline for acceptances.
After the official close of the offer last Friday, Northern would have remained independent as CE had only achieved the support of 49.77 percent of Northern shareholders. But following the extension, CE said on Monday it had 50.13 percent.
A source close to the discussions said it was ""very unusual and maybe unique"" for the panel to be in the position of deciding the fate of a company in this way.
This view was echoed by other market participants.
""This is an unndented step the panel has taken,"" one investment banking source told Reuters of the decision to grant an extension to the offer period at such a late stage.
Northern's fate now lies in the panel's hands. The company has said it wants to appeal against the decision and revert to the result at the original end of the offer period. Acceptances after the initial deadline require the panel's approval.
""They (the panel) now find themselves in a very difficult situation,"" the investment banking source added.
Any changes in the way in which the panel operates must either come from government, by bringing in legislation to establish a statutory force to regulate takeovers, or from within the body itself, market players said.
Pressure from industry participants could lead to the panel making changes itself. ""They can change the ""Blue Book"" (the rule book regulating takeovers) at the drop of a hat,"" one industry source said, adding that it had so far managed the system well.
""The panel seemed to be coping well with the upturn in bid activity. The system seemed to be working pretty well,"" he said. Mergers and acquisitions activity has reached peak levels in recent weeks, with a number of both agreed and disputed bids.
Apart from the potential threat from the European takeover directive, there had ""been no major challenges to the panel's authority over the year"", he added.
Even if the ruling Conservative Party loses a general election which must be held by next May, market participants said they did not expect pressure for legislation to put the panel on a statutory footing under a Labour government.
""The general feeling is pretty much against it (legislation) and the indications so far ist change it,"" said one.

37,"Even if British media and leisure group Pearson decides to sell its interest in merchant banking group Lazards, the bank would not be under immediate threat from larger rivals, banking sources said on Monday.
Marjorie Scardino's accession last week as Pearson chief executive has prompted widespread talk that Pearson would sell its 50 percent in Lazard Partners, which owns the three Lazard houses in London, Paris and New York.
But a pre-emption agreement in cross-shareholdings between Lazards and Pearson would ensure the partnership has first refusal on its own shares if Pearson decides to sell its stake, thus preventing the family-run merchant bank from falling into the hands of larger and expanding international rivals.
""This (speculation) is prompted by the fact that Pearson has a new chief executive who will obviously want to review things,"" one senior corporate financier told Reuters, adding that the pre-emption agreement meant Lazards ""either stays with Pearson or comes within the Lazard empire fully"".
Officials at both Pearson and Lazard Brothers in London declined to comment on talk of a possible sale.
Pearson has a 50 percent stake in London's Lazard Brothers and smaller nine percent stakes in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York. Its 50 percent stake in the umbrella group Lazard Partners was negotiated during the 1980s.
Analysts suggest Lazards does not fit into Pearson's main information, education and entertainment divisions and is therefore a target for being spun off. But banking sources point out that Lazards has been a profitable venture and not a drain.
""It (Lazards) has not required any capital or management time (from Pearson),"" the senior financier added.
Pearson, in its 1995 annual report and accounts, points out that its ""close ties to the three Lazard investment banking houses again proved their worth in 1995"".
It highlighted attributable profits of 39.9 million pounds from the group for that year. If Pearson, described by Michel David-Weill -- senior partner of Lazard Freres in Paris -- as a ""great partner"" to Lazards since 1919, decides to sever its ties with the merchant bank, there could also be other complications.
The Lazard group, which has successfully specialised in corporate finance advisory work as well as asset mangagment and trading activities, holds 48 million Pearson shares.
The Financial Times at the weekend quoted David-Weill as saying Lazards might decide to sell this 360 million pound ($600 million) stake to finance a buy-back of Pearson's holding.
The newspaper said David-Weill had said the Lazards holding in Pearson was equivalent in value to Pearson's Lazard stake.
Although Lazards's stake has been seen as obstacle to a takeover attempt against Pearson, it might sell its shares on the market but in discussion with the group and ""not to a party which could be hostile"", David-Weill told the paper.
While Scardino's role at Pearson has been the subject of close scrutiny since her appointment, Lazards have also been in the news, with suggestions of a power-struggle over who will succeed 64-year-old David-Weill.
David-Weill said last week there was no succession crisis at the bank, adding he still had time. Under the bank's statutes, he can remain at the helm for another eight years. ($1=.5974 Pound)

37,"Cable and telecoms giants Cable &amp; Wireless, NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada International on Tuesday announced the formation of a major new British cable player by merging the operations of their British subsidiaries.
This brings together C&amp;W's Mercury, British cable company Videotron, Bell Cablemedia and NYNEX CableComms.
In a related deal, Videotron is being bought by Bell Cablemedia in a complex deal which involves a $338 million equity investment in Bell Cablemedia by Cable &amp; Wireless and values Videotron at around $1.09 billion.
Videotron, which was already 26 percent owned by Bell Cablemedia, was the target of a long-running takeover battle, with Cable &amp; Wireless emerging as favourite.
Recent reports said German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom and International CableTel of the U.S. were also interested in taking it over.
Once the merger and the Videotron deal have been completed, Cable &amp; Wireless will own 52.6 percent of the new company - to be called Cable &amp; Wireless Communications - with NYNEX owning 18.5 percent and Bell Canada 14.2 percent of the shares. The remaining 15 percent will floated, C&amp;W told Reuters.
The groups intend to list the company, which will provide integrated telecommunications, information and entertainment services, in both London and New York. This is likely to take place in about six months, C&amp;W added.
Cable &amp; Wireless Communications ""...will provide local, national, international, data and mobile telecommunications, together with multichannel television and Internet services"" to around six million franchised homes and to businesses throughout Britain, the groups said in a statement.
Richard Brown, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, said the new company would be the only company in Britain able to offer multiple services that until now people had to get from different providers.
""Cable &amp; Wireless Communications will be the only company in the UK capable of offering a combination of telecoms, broadband, data transmission, video shopping and Internet access,"" Brown said in a statement.
The companies outlined a number of benefits from the new company, saying it would increase its revenues by providing a wider range of services to existing customers and increased access to a broader customer base.
It would also produce ""significant cost savings"" by eliminating duplication, enhancing purchasing power increasing capital expenditure efficiencies, they added.
As well as the services it will be able to offer immediately, the new company will be strategically positioned to offer new products such as interactive digital services and multi-media products ""as they become available"", they said.

37,"Regent Pacific, the Hong-Kong based fund which last month took a three percent stake in Britain's Hambros, said it was reassured by a meeting with chief executive Sir Chips Keswick that its profits would improve.
""It was useful to sit down and spend a little time with them. I left with the impression that the company's profits will improve,"" Julian Mayo, director of Regent Pacific Corporate Finance in London told Reuters.
A spokesman for British investment bank Hambros Plc declined to comment on the meeting but Mayo said it was ""friendly, business-like and constructive.""
Regent, often called a ""vulture fund,"" received widespread attention last month when it made the Hambros buy.
Its chief Jim Mellon was widely quoted as saying the bank, one the last few British independent investment banks, was undervalued and undermanaged. He was also reported to have said the bank's shares had been ""diabolical"" over the last 10 years.
This attack got a cool response from Hambros, which said it would meet Regent but would not otherwise comment on its new shareholder or its intentions.
Mayo said he had gone into the meeting wanting to hear what Hambros' strategy was going forward, how the bank was planning to coninue its policy of rationalisation and restructuring and when shareholders would see the fruits of it.
Asked if he was happy with the answers he received, Mayo said ""Yes, in broad terms.""
But he was less clear about Regent Pacific's long term aims in buying into Hambros, which like other British merchant banks has been the subject of takeover speculation in the past.
""Our motives are to make a good return from this investment, whether it is short or long term remains to be seen,"" Mayo said, adding that the group liked to have good relations with a company in which it invests and this was not a one-off meeting.
""We were left with the impression that the door is always open,"" Mayo said.
Regent Pacific's action had, he said highlighted what a number of analysts had been saying for some time about Hambros' performance. Undervaluation of the shares and discussions with analysts had prompted the decision to buy into Hambros, he said.
He said some analysts thought the bank's shares could rise to between 300 and 325 pence, closer to its potential value.
Hambros shares closed at 260.5 pence on Tuesday, up a penny. There was speculative buying late in August after Regent Pacific's holding became public with the share price reaching a year high of 280 pence.
But talk of a takeover or a possible break-up of the bank was dismissed by analysts at the time as unlikely in the near term, although some said it had a better break-up value.
Mayo said Regent could not launch a bid for Hambros but said a greater holding in the company was ""not out of the question,"" although it would have to notify both the bank and the stock exchange if it did buy a more significant stake.
""Whether we increase our position is something we will have to decide upon,"" he said.
In 1995 Hambros' pre-tax profits fell to 20.6 million pounds from 37.1 million the year before. Bad debt provisions grew to 36.2 million from 13.5 million pounds during the period.

""I don't think this move transforms (British Energy's) prospects at all,"" said Philip Hollobone, utilities analyst at Williams de Broe.
British Energy said in a statement it aimed to cut 1,460 jobs in Scotland and Wales to make savings in staff costs of 50 million pounds ($78 million) within three years.
It said it would have a one-off restructuring charge of 100 million pounds which was already provided for.
Chief executive Robert Hawley said there could be more savings to come as cuts in office costs came through.
Union representatives slammed the move in a statement as ""a high risk strategy,"" warning that job cuts could ""reduce training, lower standards and threaten safety.""
The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), part of Britain's Health and Safety Executive, said it would review the plans and take action if it felt safety would suffer.
""If we think (the plans) are adverse (for safety), we will use regulatory powers to stop (British Energy) doing them,"" a spokesman for the NII said.
But Hawley maintained that ""safety is our bottom line, not profit.""
British Energy's debut on the stock exchange in July was overshadowed by temporary closures of two of its eight reactors after cracks were discovered.
Shares kicked off below the partly-paid issue price of 105 pence to institutions and 100 pence to small investors and have rarely moved above those levels, mangaging just a half penny rise on the day on Wednesday to stand at 108 pence at 1130 GMT.
The ruling Conservative government pressed ahead with its privatisation despite the deep unpopularity of the deal and has been left with a stake of around 12 percent.
The opposition Labour Party also criticised the job cuts, which energy and industry spokesman John Battle said showed British Energy ""has not performed as they promised they would.""
He called on the company to confirm its dividend policy which it has said is vulnerable to underperformance by nuclear power stations.
Although Hawley maintained the company's plans were aimed at making ""absolutely sure we are competitive in the market place,"" analysts expressed concern it faced stiff challenges and remained an unattractive investment.
""They are under pressure,"" said Marshall Whiting of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST).
Whiting said the crucial factor for British Energy was price of electricity in the so-called ""pool,"" or wholesale market.
""Pressure on electricity prices is downward in the medium to long term. (British Energy) has to address operating costs to get profits to stand still,"" he said.
Hollobone said the cost cuts should make predictions for dividend growth more secure but added that these were still below market averages.
""Dividend growth is one of the lowest in the sector and there is no sign of a special dividend,"" he said.
British Energy said at its privatisation that the first interim dividend would be 4.6 pence a share and forecasts for final dividend are for 9.1 pence in 1996/97.
""You can get better value elsewhere. Why invest in British Energy?"" Hollobone said. ($1=.6393 Pound)

47,"Dixons Group Plc became the latest British retailer to report a boost in Christmas sales on Wednesday but market watchers said there was no 1980s-style boom as discriminating buyers kept shops competitive.
""There isn't a big consumer boom but there is growth in the consumer economy,"" Dixons managing director John Clare told Reuters as the electronic goods firm reported sales up eight percent in the period over Christmas.
""There is certainly a return to the ""feel good' factor, but it isn't a return to the spend, spend, spend culture of the eighties,"" said Clive Vaughan, retail consultant at research group Verdict.
Analysts pointed out that as Christmas fell on a Wednesday in 1996, many shoppers left purchases to the last minute and retailers were likely to have seen a late flurry of buying.
At the same time, consumers are more discerning than in past years, preferring to pay for quality and investing in durables, which has favoured the higher end of the retail sector.
""Consumers are more discerning, so the high street is still very competitive on price and quality,"" said Hugh Clark of the British Retail Consortium, which represents over 90 percent of retailers and will release its December sales figures next week.
British money supply data released on Monday showed a higher than expected increase in December month-on-month figures, suggesting continuing buoyancy on the high street, analysts said.
Leading British department store Harrods, kicking off its January sale, said on Wednesday sales during the Christmas period were up 10 percent and two percent ahead of budget.
""It was a very strong, very consistent Christmas,"" said Michael Cole, Harrods director of public affairs.
On the Monday before Christmas, Harrods had sales of three million pounds ($5 million), compared with average daily intake of 1.2 to 1.5 million, he said, record Monday takings for the group.
Meanwhile, Merchant Retail Group said on Wednesday its specialist Perfume Shop chain saw same store sales soar 18.6 percent in the Christmas period.
Department store chain John Lewis said last week that sales in the week ending December 28 were up 8.8 percent on a year ago, while jewellers Goldsmiths said sales from existing stores jumped 9.8 percent in the Christmas period.
Aspreys, jewellers to the Royal Family, told a newspaper last week that Christmas sales had been ""substantially better than last year, a double-digit increase.""
Clothing retailer Next Plc is expected to report Christmas sales by mid-January but analysts pointed out that its strong brand image should bolster performance.
""Indications are that the polarisation of stronger versus weaker retailers continues,"" said Roy Maconochie, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. ""The consumer is more discriminating so stronger brands win out,""
Verdict's Vaughan said consumer demographics were also influencing product sales as the youthful buyers of the eighties become the more cautious over-30-year-old consumers of the nineties and have more disposable income. ($1=.5922 Pound)

47,"The British supermarket group ASDA racked up a gain in first half results and sales on Thursday and analysts said there were signs of more to come.
""We thought this recovery story would come to an end sooner but there is still more upside, it seems,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
ASDA, known for innovation and cheeky marketing initiatives, said pretax profits before exceptionals were 160.1 million pounds ($267 million), up from 138.3 million pounds ($230 million) a year ago, and paid out a dividend of 0.81 pence per share, up from 0.72 pence.
Sales from existing stores in the first half were 10.2 percent up on a year ago and ASDA edged up its market share by 0.5 points to 10.6 percent.
""Keeping it simple has been the key to our success. These results show we are on course to deliver...our (strategy) programme for 1998,"" chairman Archie Norman said in a statement.
ASDA's shares touched a high of 125 pence before edging back to be down 1/2 pence at 123.1/4 pence by 1103 GMT.
ASDA's sales gain is the highest in the industry for the period and comes on top of a strong rise a year ago.
""That is an extraordinary performance, double digit on double digit,"" said the analyst.
""One thing the market seems to have underestimated is how low the point was that ASDA recovered from,"" he added.
ASDA implemented a three-year ""Renewal"" strategy in the early 1990s aimed at turning the group round from huge debts and slow sales, which was followed this year by the start of a three-year ""Breakout"" strategy.
""I think the market thought Renewal was the recovery and it was over but that is not the case at all, they are carrying on the gains into Breakout,"" the analyst said.
ASDA said its aim to be the lowest on price had been achieved ""with only a modest investment in our gross margn,"" as it moved to cut operating and distribution costs.
Leighton, who took over as chief executive from the entrepeneurial Norman in August, said second half margins were likely to be similar to those in the first six months, ""down a bit, a smidgeon.""
He said much of the impact in the first half had come from petrol, where a fierce price war has raged between supermarkets and oil companies, but pressures now seem to be easing.
ASDA is also trying to push its total sales to include more own-brand products where margins are generally higher.
It said own-brand goods now accounted for 35 percent of total sales, adding it was ""well on our way to achieving our...objective of 40 percent ASDA brand penetration by 1998.""
The company aims to open seven stores in the second half, which will all be large, ""market hall"" style, Leighton said, with similar opening levels on the cards for a couple of years..
Leighton said the company wanted the ""critical mass"" to drive growth markets of fresh food, entertainment, clothing and healthcare.
But he said the group was ""under no pressure"" to launch a loyalty card throughout the country, even though the other three major supermarkets -- J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway -- have all started schemes nationwide.
ASDA is testing a card in several stores but Leighton said ASDA customers tended to focus on price, quality and service. ($1=.6003 Pound)

47,"Electricity generator Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc turned in lower than expected half year profits on Thursday but hiked its dividend by 11 percent.
""We aim to keep on delivering dividend improvement...doing it by expanding the business,"" chief executive Roger Young told Reuters in an interview.
Pretax profits edged down to 61.3 million pounds ($101.6 million) from 61.7 million previously, below expectations of 63 to 70.7 million. The dividend was 5.28 pence per share.
The shares were down 1-1/2 pence at 316.5p at 1145 GMT.
Scottish Hydro said low rainfall had hit profits, as hydro-electric generation had been replaced in part by coal at a cost of 6.3 million pounds.
But chairman Lord Wilson said in a statement that the second half had started well and he was confident of ""an encouraging result for the full 12 month period.""
Scottish Hydro said it was preferred bidder for the 50 percent stake in Keadby power station, northeast England, owned by United Utilities, its joint venture partner there, and aimed to complete the deal by the end of the current financial year.
Young said the plan would ""increase costs but also increase profits"", adding an extra 340 megaWatt of generation capacity to the company's existing portfolio.
Scottish Hydro said the deal should increase gearing to around 50 percent if it went ahead and added that together with existing expenditure commitments, gearing should peak at 65 percent in 1998-99.
""We are confident of the prospects for Keadby and look forward to the opportunity to exploit its capabilities in the market place,"" the company said in a statement.
Young said the company aimed to boost market share to seven percent from a current four percent by 1999 with a total investment in combined heat and power (CHP) plant for commercial customers of over 150 million pounds.
The company said that action taken to raise output and cut costs would improve performance over the next two to three years and added that raising standards was a key aim.
Scottish Hydro said that changes proposed to capital allowances in the British budget in November were expected to reverse a trend of falling tax rates but added it would not be possible to predict the impact accurately until full details were known.
The company will be looking to expand its domestic business, Young said, but a resumption of talks with British Gas on the sale of the latter's supply interests was unlikely, he added.
""I would not be optimistic of a resumption,"" he said.
British Gas announced in September that talks on the sale of its domestic gas supply business in England and Scotland to Scottish Hydro had been called off, scotching newspaper reports that the sale would bring in around 250 million pounds.
Young said the breakdown was for administrative rather than commerical reasons.
""There was no serious commercial difficulty that caused the project to be dropped...British Gas had a lot of competition for its (administrative) resources,"" he said.
But he said the moment for the deal might now have passed. ""Deals tend to have their day,"" he said, adding that there . were other discussions around, ""but nothing that we can talk about."" ($1=.6034 Pound)

47,"A unit of CalEnergy Co., a fast-growing, Nebraska-based energy company, Monday launched a $1.2 billion takeover bid for British regional utility Northern Electric Plc, which promptly rejected the unsolicited offer.
The bid is the latest for a British power company and the second for Northern Electric in just over a year. Industry analysts said Northern Electric might end up agreeing to a takeover if it could extract a higher price.
Omaha, Neb.-based CalEnergy, through its 70 percent-owned CE Electric unit, said it would pay 630 British pence ($10.06) for each common share and 103 pence ($1.64) for each preferred share of Northern Electric, making the deal worth about $1.23 billion. The U.S.-based construction and mining company Peter Kiewit Sons owns the other 30 percent of CE Electric.
Northern Electric successfully fended off a hostile bid last year from Trafalgar House, now owned by Sweden's Kvaerner, by offering a special package worth 560 million pounds ($894 million) for shareholders.
""Our strategy is to become a leading global provider of a full range of energy services,"" CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol said in a statement announcing the offer.
Sokol's company has invested in geothermal and other energy projects at home and in Indonesia and the Philippines in recent years. Its core operations are in California, New York and Texas, and the bid for Northern Electric is a major move outside the U.S. market.
U.S. utilities, faced with slow growth and deregulation in their local markets, have been merging in the United States and investing abroad as they seek to grow.
Sokol said Northern Electric, based in northeastern England, had distribution and supply know-how that would complement CalEnergy's production capacity, while its size was ""very manageable.""
""They are the smallest regional electricity company and that means that you can get them cheaper,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
""We will see an agreed bid eventually,"" said Philip Hollobone at brokers Williams de Broe, who said CE Electric might eventually raise its price to secure agreement from Northern's board of directors.
In its statement rejecting the bid, Northern Electric said that in talks through Sunday, CE Electric had contemplated offering about 700 pence ($11.17) per share.
""Northern Electric is clearly saying you can have us for 700 pence per share,"" said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified.
CE Electric, which bought a 12.7 percent stake in Northern in the open market, said that it never suggested ""any intent to value the company at 'around 700 pence per share' or even anywhere close to this figure.""
Sokol said he felt the offer was ""a very full price,"" adding that CE Electric had sought a merger agreement with Northern Electric but ""the only area we could not agree on was value.""
Some analysts said Northern Electric's weak balance sheet would limit what CE Electric would be willing to bid and that it might be hoping to attract another bidder. The special shareholders' package it paid to fend off Trafalgar House left it heavily in debt.
Northern Electric stock jumped 131 pence ($2.09) to close at 651 pence ($10.40) after CE Electric had managed to buy its 12.72 percent stake at the offered price earlier in the session.
CalEnergy announced in August that it bought three gas-fired cogeneration plants in Texas, Pennsylvania and New York for $226 million from Falcon Seaboard Resources Inc., a closely held energy company.
"
47,"Electricity stocks crackled higher on Friday as rumours swirled around the market of a U.S. buyer for one of five remaining regional utilities and analysts said the forthcoming results season could provide a spur for action.
""There is going to be a big focus on the ability of these companies to hand out more cash...if the results season is not going to get it going, then nothing will,"" said Chris Perry, analyst at Charterhouse Tilney.
Electricity sector companies kick off their half year results season towards the end of November.
Leading the sector higher on Friday was East Midlands Electricity, after a report in the Daily Mail newspaper that a bid might emerge from Houston Industries of the United States at around 750 pence a share.
Houston, tipped to buy one of the five remaining regional electricity companies (Recs) earlier this year, had been thought to have given up on the idea in August when it bought U.S. gas utility NorAm Energy for $3.8 billion.
East Midlands shot up to a high of 565 pence but eased back to close at 562, up 44 pence.
""At the time of its last results, the company effectively indicated its surprise that it hadn't been taken over. Their shares had fallen back a long way and perhaps it's no surprise that bid rumours are re-emerging,"" Perry said.
Other power utilities which remain independent also climbed, with Yorkshire Electricity up 28 pence to 742 pence and Southern Electric adding 13.5 pence to 631 pence.
Northern Electric, which survived a takeover bid from Trafalgar House last year, was up 29 pence to 523 pence and London Electricity, which supplies the capital with power, jumped 18.5 pence to 585 pence.
""East Midlands is the one most likely to face a bid, it is smaller than others and more purely a distribution company,"" Nigel Hawkins at brokers Yamaichi said.
A report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper also suggested that U.S. utility Duke Power might be circling the sector but no comment was available from either U.S. company.
Analysts said U.S. companies might not be the only ones interested in the sector, which has seen seven of the 12 Recs created at privatisation in 1990 fall prey to takeover bids.
The domestic supply business is to be opened to competition in 1998 and a range of companies from oil producers to supermarkets have already indicated an interest.
Other potential interest could come from water companies, analysts said, especially following Britain's decision on Friday to block planned bids for South West Water from Severn Trent and Wessex Water.
""You've got two disappointed companies there,"" said Marshall Whiting of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
Analysts said Severn Trent could decide to use its resources to make a share buyback or a special dividend payout.
But Wessex Water may be enticed to link up with Southern Electric, analysts said, as multi-utilities have been approved.
Welsh Water took over Swalec to form Hyder while United Utilities combined North West Water and Norweb.
""The idea of multi-utilities is gaining ground,"" Whiting said.
"
47,"British regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric pumped up its defence against a 650 pence per share bid from CE Electric of the U.S. on Tuesday with promises of higher dividends and unit mergers.
The company expected a 17 percent rise in its year dividend to 50 pence per share with growth over seven percent from then to the end of the century, it said in a statement, adding it planned to merge its supply business with another Rec to find cost savings of over 28 million pounds ($46 million) a year.
""It's a fairly aggressive statement from Northern Electric showing they're preparing yet again to gear up to the gunwales,"" said Yamaichi utilities analyst Nigel Hawkins.
Northern spent 560 million pounds a year ago on a package of shareholder benefits to fight off Trafalgar House, now part of Kvaerner, and has strived to reduce its debt since.
""We are saying the company is worth at least as much as we said before...and clearly it is worth more than 650 pence per share,"" Northern chairman David Morris told Reuters.
CE Electric, which is 70 percent-owned by CalEnergy, decided to raise its bid from 630 pence per share on Friday and drew a deadline of December 20, just four days after UK Trade Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide whether the bid may proceed.
Morris said Northern Electric would have a ""broadly equal partnership"" in its plans for merging its electricity supply business with another firm. He declined to name the Rec involved in talks but said it ""may well not be a nearby one.""
Neighbouring Yorkshire Electricity earlier on Tuesday told Reuters it had not held talks with Northern on the issue.
Northern has said a price of 700 pence was indicated before CE Electric launched its bid, a claim which the Americans have consistently denied.
The Rec rushed out half year results at the end of November and said its debt position should ease to around half previous expectations by March 1997 as it pushed for an increase in CE Electric's bid price.
""This is an exercise in re-arranging the deckchairs on the good ship scorched earth,"" said a spokesman for CE Electric, which has already secured 33.27 percent of its target.
Northern had also said it was in talks with a possible partner in its Sovereign upstream gas business, after it bought out its previous colleague Neste Oy last year.
Morris said this deal would be ""imminent were there not a bid,"" but declined to name the company.
Shares in Northern struggled higher, up 8.5 pence to 614 pence by 0934 GMT, after touching a peak of 620 pence, as concerns the government might block the bid continued to weigh.
Seven of the original 12 cash-rich Recs set up at privatisation in 1990 have already been snapped up by predators, three to U.S. firms.
Of the remaining five, East Midlands Electricity has agreed to a $2.15 billion takeover by Dominion Resources of the U.S. while talks between U.S.-based Entergy and London Electric were called off last month.
Only two bids for Recs have so far been blocked by the UK. Generators National Power and PowerGen were banned from buying into the supply and distribution business through Southern Electric and Midlands Electricity respectively.
But there are concerns that the ruling pro-privatisation Conservative party might turn about face on current bids and block them in a bid for popularity. It trails the opposition Labour party in polls with a general election due by May 1997.
Privatised electricity companies have come under heavy criticism from lobby groups and politicians for hefty handouts to shareholders, bulging pay packets for executives and spiralling takeovers.

47,"British supermarket retailer J. Sainsbury Plc tried to steal a march on its competitors on Friday by launching insurance products through its Homebase do-it-yourself subsidiary.
The deal, which sees Sainsbury teaming up with brokers Willis Corroon, will offer home and contents insurance, garden insurance and personal accident insurance with details to be released to the public in early February.
Sainsbury became the first supermarket to announce plans to break into banking in October when it teamed up with Bank of Scotland to set up Sainsbury's Bank, which awaits a licence from UK authorities.
The insurance service will be offered to all Homebase customers which are thought to total around 12 million, with initial marketing aimed at the unit's two million loyalty card holders.
The service will be provided by a panel made up of Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, Guardian Royal Exchange, Norwich Union, Eagle Star and Lloyds of London.
""We believe that the Homebase brand values can make a real difference in the home insurance market,"" Mike Samuel, Homebase head of marketing, said in a statement.
Sainsbury said the major features of the products would be 250 pounds ($420.2) emergency cover, cover for home removal, Christmas, birthdays and accidental damage to televisions and satellites.
In addition, discounts of over 50 pounds would be offered on Homebase security products when a policy is taken out.
""The product chosen by Sainsbury's Homebase encompasses all the expected features of home insurance but with a safety net of cover not usually available with standard market products,"" said Richard Fry, head of business development at Willis Corroon.
Sainsbury shares had closed down five pence at 387.5 pence before the announcement was made.
Analysts said they were encouraged when Sainsbury moved into banking as there had been concerns that it was losing more and more ground to arch-rival Tesco.
Tesco was the first of the big four supermarket groups to launch a loyalty card and its success forced Sainsbury to bring out its own version around a year later in June 1996.
Safeway also has a loyalty card while ASDA is now testing its own version in selected stores.
Meanwhile Tesco has added a ClubCard Plus credit account for customers while Safeway teamed up with high-street bank Abbey National in November to offer banking services through its ABC loyalty card. ($1=.5950 Pound)

47,"Britain's Northern Electric challenged predator CE Electric on Friday to raise its 630 pence per share bid as it paraded results and forecasts which it claimed proved it was worth more.
""They need to get their cheque book out if they are going to further this bid at all,"" Northern chairman David Morris told a news conference.
But CE Electric, the British bid vehicle for U.S. energy group CalEnergy, said in a statement that Northern's results were ""lacklustre"" and below its expectations.
The regional electricity company, or Rec, said pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 slipped to 50.7 million pounds ($85.12 million) from 58.7 million pounds and an interim dividend of 12.85 pence was paid out, up from 12 pence.
Full year pretax profits would be more than 112 million pounds, the company said, with a final dividend forecast of 29.85 pence.
Northern, which last year fended off a bid from Trafalgar House, now part of Kvaerner, with a 560 million pound shareholder benefit package, said gearing should fall to 95 percent by March 31 compared with forecasts last year of 175 percent.
Morris said CE Electric ""is clearly going to have to pay a great deal more than 630 pence per share"" to win control.
He said the company would be willing to talk with CE Electric ""on the basis of more than 700 pence"", but executives said at 630 pence there was nothing to discuss.
Northern has claimed that CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., had indicated a price of 700 pence before it launched its hostile bid in October.
CE Electric denied that claim and went on to snap up nearly 30 percent of Northern as its shares languished, weighed by concerns that the U.K. government might block the bid.
""I do not think they (Northern) have announced anything that is going to make CE Electric put its price up,"" said one sector analyst.
But a second analyst said he thought there was ""clearly value there in excess of 630 pence,"" and suggested the two sides might be able to come to an agreed bid at a higher level.
Shares in the Rec fell one penny to 589 pence by 1415 GMT.
Northern said gearing, without payment of a special dividend of 56.5 pence due in February under last year's defence package, would be roughly in line with other electricity companies.
It argued that, based on the forecast cash flow for 1997, it should be valued at 745 pence a share to balance the current agreed bid for a fellow Rec, East Midlands Electricity, from Dominion Resources of the U.S.
That bid valued East Midlands at 670 pence per share but its stock was also dampened by government approval worries and was trading at 609 pence, up 1.5 pence.
""We are simply pointing out the value of Northern Electric,"" Morris said, adding that if the government approved the bid, the figures would be more fully appreciated.
Northern has said it felt the government should approve the bid but maintained that 630 pence did not represent its true value.
""These results and forecasts help to demonstrate that there is significant further value within Northern Electric, value which CE Electric's offer fails to reflect,"" Morris said.
Some analysts said the results and forecasts underlined the judgement that CE Electric's bid undervalued the company.
""The company is worth something around 670 pence, if you exclude the bid premium and shareholders should hold out for something nearer 700 pence,"" said one analyst, anonymously. ($1=.5956 Pound)

47,"U.S. utility group CE Electric upped the stakes in its hostile bid for British power company Northern Electric on Friday, raising its offer to a final 650 pence a share and setting a December 20 deadline.
But CE's hopes that Northern would recommend the raised 782 million pound ($1.29 billion) bid were dashed as Northern rejected the offer after carefull consideration.
CE Electric chairman David Sokol's said earlier he hoped Northern would recommend the bid after it was raised from 759 million pounds.
CE Electric, the bid vehicle for CalEnergy of the United States, said the new offer represented ""compelling value.""
""This is an overwhelmingly strong offer,"" Sokol said in an interview.
But Northern Electric chairman David Morris responded with a statement saying: ""CE Electric has failed to recognise Northern Electric's true value in its revised offer.""
""It (CE) has ignored the new information provided and it is still looking to buy Northern Electric too cheaply. Shareholders should reject this revised offer.""
CE Electric has already snapped up nearly 30 percent of its target as Northern's share price has languished under concerns that the British government would block the bid.
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide by December 16 whether or not to refer the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) for review.
Northern's shares lost 1p to 600 pence by the close as the overall market slid by more than two percent.
""The latest offer probably still undervalues Northern but I think it will succeed...I think shareholders will (accept),"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
Northern rushed out half year results last week as part of its efforts to push up CE Electric's offer and said gearing should have fallen to 95 percent by March 1997 against earlier forecasts of 175 percent.
Northern has claimed that talks between the two companies before CE Electric launched its bid indicated a price of 700 pence per share but the Americans have consistently denied this.
Sokol said Northern had not produced any new information in its defence documents but added CE Electric had been holding back ""a certain amount of dollars"" in hopes of a recommendation.
""But given that Northern's board has not wanted to talk, we felt it was not fair to withhold the cash from shareholders,"" Sokol said.
He said the final deadline had been brought forward to December 20 from early January because it would give certainty to employees and shareholders ahead of the holiday season.
Northern, one of only a handful of independent power companies remaining, has called on the government to let the bid go ahead and made clear its only dispute with CE Electric is on price. ($1=.6082 Pound)

38,"British insurance broker and risk management consultant Willis Corroon Group Plc on Wednesday blamed sterling's strength and continued competition for a five percent fall in profits over the first three months of the year.
Pre-tax profits first quarter fell to 45.7 million pounds ($74.7 million) in the first quarter from 48.1 million pounds last year.
But after adjusting for the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements of 4.4 million pounds, underlying profits were up four percent.
Brokerage and fee revenue from continuing operations fell by seven percent to 184.2 million pounds.
Willis executive chairman John Reeve said the results were in line with expectations at the start of the year and reflected ""intensifying competition"" between underwriters which had led to further falls in premium rates.
Shares in the company dipped slightly after the figures which analysts said broadly met forecasts, losing four pence to 144 pence by late morning.
""There's the effect of falling premium rates, the effect of the currency and an element of shifting profits from the first quarter to later in the year,"" said one analyst.
""They are looking to enhance shareholder value over time but it's not going to happen overnight. There isn't any great underlying revenue growth. Costs are likely to be held down and brokerage to remain flat so it's not very exciting basically.""
The strengthening of sterling against the dollar and other currencies had a disproportionate effect on the results due to the weighting of foreign currency revenues in the company's global speciality businesses in the early part of the year.
As previously forecast, changes in the pattern of the business were likely to reduce the proportion of annual profit arising in the first quarter, Reeve said.
""Against this background, our underlying performance is satisfactory, with encouraging growth in a number of key business segments,"" he said.
Industry consolidation had led to significant shifts in the competitive environment and the resulting large combinations created both challenges and opportunities, said Reeve.
A series of mergers among rivals has left Willis and British rival Sedgwick Group trailing far behind industry giants Aon Corp and Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc of the U.S.
Chicago-based Aon has bought out three of its rivals in the past six months and said only last week that it was still interested in doing more deals.
Marsh &amp; McLennan's $1.8 billion acquisition of privately-owned Johnson &amp; Higgins in March has further increased the pressure on the two British brokers and raised the prospect of the two being pushed into each others arms as the only solution to their current difficulties.
However, Willis has always brushed off suggestions it may be interested in teaming up with its British rival.
Reeve said the company intended to continue to pursue its change programme, designed to alter fundamentally the way it does business and ""seize new development opportunities within the altered market-place.""

38,"British telecoms regulator OFTEL said on Wednesday it proposed to reduce the regulatory demands which were imposed on telephone group Mercury Communications in the early 1980s.
OFTEL said Mercury, part of the Cable &amp; Wireless Group, would have a simplified licence covering both domestic and international operations and that a number of obligations would be removed to reflect Mercury's non-dominant position, particularly in the domestic market.
Mercury, the second largest telecom company in Britain, has 11.5 percent of the UK's domestic telecommunications market compared with BT's 80 percent share.
Mercury welcomed the changes saying they provided more flexibility on pricing.
""We are delighted. Under the new regime we can be more flexible in our prices. It increases our ability to be more competitive,"" a Mercury official told Reuters.
OFTEL also said that rapidly developing competition in the international market may allow it to withdraw further still from detailed regulation and it would be keeping the proposals under review, with a view to lifting them in whole or in part as soon as competition was sufficient to allow it to do so.
The proposals include replacing Mercury's existing service obligation for inland services by standard obligations for non-dominant operators and draft licence proposals from the Department of Trade. International service obligations will remain unchanged.
OFTEL is also backing new conditions to ensure fair trading and effective competition in international markets.
In addition, it proposes to replace Mercury's obligation to publish its prices with more flexible conditions. These will be modelled on the price publication requirements in the draft International Facilities Licence, on which the Department of Trade and Industry is currently holding consultations.
The Mercury official described the measures as ""another milestone"" saying it would help close the gap with its much bigger rival British Telecommunications Plc (BT) as far as marketing of services were concerned.
""This reflects our relative market position and gives us the flexibility to offer our customers truly bespoke solutions, designed to meet their specific business needs. At the end of the day it's the customers who will be the winners,"" he said.
Analysts said the Oftel move was expected and would probably not lead to substantially more customers: ""They can price services for different customers, but it is not a big deal,"" said James Golob at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

38,"Britain on Friday launched a new watchdog for the country's 200,000 occupational pension schemes.
Called the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA), the body was set up in the wake of the pension scandal surrounding publishing mogul the late Robert Maxwell.
The independent watchdog, which will be based in Brighton on the English south coast and starts operations on Monday, was established under the Pensions Act 1995 drawn up in the wake of the Maxwell pensions scandal of 1991.
The new act comes into force on April 6 and the reforms are designed to reinforce the most important parts of existing British pensions law.
OPRA chief executive Caroline Johnston said it would be naive to say that one could guarantee that there could not be a recurrence of the Maxwell situation when more than 400 million pounds ($655 million) went missing, but she expressed confidence that it would be ""much less likely"" in the future.
OPRA will ensure that occupational schemes, which control some 500 billion pounds of assets, abide by the new rules and are adequately funded to cover members' pensions.
Its remit is to see that the interests of Britain's 12 million members of company pension schemes are protected and that occupational pension schemes comply with the law.
It will have powers to investigate suspected breaches of the law and take legal, disciplinary or regulatory action against employers or trustees where breaches are found.
Under the Pensions Act legislation, it will have the power to investigate trustees, search company offices and seize documents.
Actuaries and auditors will be under a new statutory duty to report clients if they find rules being breached.
In the event of any wrongdoing, OPRA will be able to fine trustees, remove them from their posts, disqualify them and, if necessary, replace them with their own nominees.
It can also wind up schemes and apply for injunctions to prevent the misuse of pension scheme assets.
OPRA chairman John Hayes promised the body would take a pragmatic approach and did not necessarily expect schemes to be in a position to comply with every aspect of the new Pensions Act from day one.
""We will deal with cases on merit...and be sensitive but tough,"" Hayes said.
And while it plans to make use of publicity to encourage compliance, OPRA says it will not be heavy handed with small-mistakes that do not involve dishonesty or a deliberate ignoring of the rules.
The new regime will rely heavily on tip-offs and has set up a hotline to enable employees and pensioners to pass on information -- anonymously if they wish.

38,"Members of the Norwich Union are to receive 3.1 billion pounds ($5.1 billion) worth of free shares after they overwhelmingly approved plans on Friday to float the insurance group on the London Stock Exchange in June.
The company, Britain's third largest life insurer, said that nearly 99 percent of members who voted had backed management's proposals to drop mutual status and become a public company.
The results of a postal vote announced at a sparsely attended extraordinary general meeting showed 21,000 votes against the plans dwarfed by over 1.85 million members in favour.
Less than 200 Norwich Union members turned up to the meeting held at the London Arena in the capital's Dockland, but a number who did voiced their opposition to the flotation which will see members net an average 800 pounds worth of shares.
Another one million ""non-profit"" policyholders of the group will receive a fixed handout of shares worth beween 330 and 400 pounds.
Norwich Union chief executive Allan Bridgewater welcomed the result. ""We are delighted to have received a resounding endorsement from our members for the flotation proposal and thank them for voting in such numbers,"" he said.
There were few doubts about the outcome of the vote which follows a series of similar moves by British building societies in the past year.
The Halifax, Alliance and Leicester, and the Woolwich have all received unequivocal backing for plans to convert to banks which have also involved distributing hundreds of pounds worth of shares to members.
Norwich Union also plans to raise 1.75 billion pounds of fresh capital through an offer of new shares in May and Bridegewater said he hoped a considerable part of this would come from existing members increasing their shareholdings.
They will be able to purchase the shares at a discount, the size of which has yet to be announced.
The demutualisation and flotation of the company, the first by a mutually-owned British insurer, will value Norwich Union at around five billion pounds and rank it among Britain's 50 largest companies.
Norwich Union's 10,000 employees will share in the giveawy, receiving 150 shares each.
The two million with-profit members will receive a minimum of 300 shares with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policy holdings as at October 1, 1996.
But the giving up of mutual status, entailing the transfer of ownership from policyholders to shareholders is an emotive issue.
Supporters of mutuality argue that it gives members undiluted exposure to the profits of the business without the need to pay dividends to shareholders.
The attraction of demutualisation is the access to capital it gives. It was the need for capital, with the greater investment flexibility it brings, which drove Scoottish Amicable to put itself up for auction in February.
But there are questionmarks over how long Norwich Union will be able to hold onto its independence.
Australian mutual AMP which lost out in its fight for Scottish Amicable to Britain's Prudential last month, has made no secret of its desire to expand in Britain.
Interest may also come from Europe with a number of continetal insurers including Dutch insurer Aegon and Germany's Allianz looking for a foothold in Britain.
Norwich Union argues its plans will offer more scope for developing the business in the future and allow the separation of the group's life operations from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.
A court hearing formally to approve the proposals will take place on April 23.

38,"Lloyd's of London Names -- the traditional backers of Lloyd's insurance market -- will have to dig deep in their pockets in future if as expected a working party set up to assess the market's funding recommends an increase in the minimum amounts Names provide to support their underwriting, insurance sources said.
Lloyd's, still smarting from massive claims suffered by the market between 1988 and 1992, is expected to announce fundamental changes to its capital structure in the next week, the sources said on Wednesday.
According to the sources, the report filed by the working party should be published within the next few days.
At present Names must put up between 20 and 30 percent of their underwriting capacity as deposits, compared with 50 percent for corporate investors.
Under the working party's plans Names may be required to provide at least 32.5 percent next year, and 37.5 percent in the following year, according to a report in Britain's Financial Times newspaper.
One source at Lloyds described the figures as looking ""familiar in terms of earlier discusssions here"".
The new system would require all investors to show evidence of assets totalling 50 percent of premiums.
The eight billion pound ($13 billion) losses between 1988 and 1992, which have prompted the latest changes and at one point threatened to sink Lloyd's, ushered in the introduction of corporate capital for the first time and a decline in the number of Names to below 10,000 for the first time since the mid-70s.
In 1989, the figure was over 34,000.
Corporate funds now account for around 44 percent of this year's 10.3 billion pound capacity and since their introduction have been strengthening ties with managing agents which run insurance syndicates.
Only last week Commercial Union became the first major composite insurer to enter Lloyd's with the purchase of Marlborough Underwriting Agency.
The developments raise questions about Names' long term future at Lloyd's and some observers expect the share of corporate capacity to rise to two-thirds or more by the turn of the century.

38,"British insurer Legal &amp; General (L&amp;G) on Thursday reported a double digit rise in profits for 1996 and gave an upbeat assessment of the outlook for the group.
But the company ruled out acquisitions in the life and pensions business and said that despite stiff competition, rising sales and profits would continue to underpin strong dividend growth in the future.
""Our strategy is not dependent on mergers and acquisitions. We don't want our efforts diverted by someone else's problems,"" said L&amp;G chief executive David Prosser.
The in-line results and prospects for dividend growth helped L&amp;G shares to a new all-time high of 423 pence. By late morning the shares were trading at 415-1/2 pence, a rise of 9-1/2 pence on the day.
Analysts said there were few surprises in the figures, though the dividend was slightly ahead of forecast.
The trebling of the value of new business, was singled out as particularly positive.
""There were exceptional factors in there but nevertheless they've done a tremendous job in taking the new business value up from 20 million ($31.9 million) to 60 million pounds. That was the most striking piece of good news,"" commented one analyst.
Despite a ""very competitive"" trading environment, which he said was likely to continue, Prosser expressed satisfaction at the year's performance.
Sales growth continued to be based on competitive pricing and product innovation but reductions in profitability produced by cutting prices were being offset by increases in business volume, he said.
""There's a lot of market share about if you do this business sensibly and we do appear to be in a virtuous circle. We're winning additional sales growth, getting lower unit costs as a result, good growth in embedded value of new business and a good increase in shareholder value,"" he told Reuters.
More competitive products, supported by lower administartion costs, cost effective sales distribution and good investment returns, result in higher sales, greater customer loyalty and increased profit, said Prosser.
Despite a 54 percent jump in new business in 1996, L&amp;G still had less than five percent market share and the focus going foward would continue to be on growing volume, said Prosser.
But the sharp increases in British bulk annuity business in 1996 which saw single new premium business rise to more than four times 1995 levels, is unlikely to be replicated in 1997.
Operating profits for the twelve months were up over 15 percent to 291.4 million pounds and the dividend was raised 14 percent to 11.13 pence per share.
Profits from life and pensions businesses rose nearly 14 percent to 250 million pounds while general insurance profits rose to 29.9 million pounds from 23.4 million pounds the previous year.
The sale of the company's commercial lines business resulted in a pre-tax exceptional profit of 70 million pounds.
The investment maangement arm had a good year in winning new business and with 48.1 billion pounds under management, a 20 percent increase on the year, the group is now one of Britain's largest fund managers.
Like rival insurers the group had seen some firming in motor rates but this was slow and very selective.
""Household is more dificult. I think some people are seeing rate reductions and some are getting rate increases. Household is becoming more selective on underwriting and pricing of risk -- the shape of pricing is changing,"" said Prosser.

38,"British composite insurer Commercial Union Plc on Wednesday reported a strong rise in first quarter profits, helped by a sharp fall in U.S. weather claims.
Pre-tax operating profits rose to 102 million pounds ($166.4 million), up from 83 million last year.
The results were in line with expectations but the shares lost ground after a recent good run.
Forecasts were likely to be left largely unchanged, analysts said, and by mid-afternoon Commercial Union shares had slipped 13-1/2 pence to 736p.
The strength of the pound held back headline figures and, excluding the impact of sterling, profits advanced 46 percent. On the same basis profits and new business sales in the group's life business rose 25 percent.
General insurance profits increased to 67 million pounds, up three million pounds over 1996 despite a reduction in profits in Britain due to increased competition.
The company is set to unveil details of its strategy for the UK general insurance business next month.
A fall in weather losses helped U.S. results while France and Australia also saw profit increases.
Weather claims in the U.S. fell 23 million pounds over the period to six million pounds after the milder winter.
In Britain, weather costs were broadly flat.
But a dry start to the year and increased turnover in the housing market combined to push up subsidence costs.
Claims notifications were up 11 percent while costs increased to 11 million pounds from seven million pounds.
Echoing comments made by General Accident which reported on Tuesday, Commercial Union said British general insurance rates remained competitive though there was evidence of firming in certain classes of business, particularly motor.
U.S. general insurance was also competitive and average rate increases there had broadly matched inflation.
France was seeing rises in certain classes but areas such as motor cover were becoming more difficult, the company said.
Life profits over the quarter increased to 62 million pounds from 58 million pounds last year, with strong performances from the UK, the Netherlands and France.
Excluding the impact of exchange rates, new life, pensions and investment sales rose by 25 percent.
With the acquisition of 73 percent of French life assurer Societe d'Epargne Viagere (SEV) in April, life operations now account for around 50 percent of total group premium income.
The growth of the life business, part of a long-standing strategy, is set to continue for the foreseeable future.
The company hopes to take advantage of future changes in welfare provision in Britain and continental Europe.
Demographic changes putting pressure on spending on state pensions, sickness and accident benefits is expected to provide a growing number of opportunities for private providers in years to come.
Growth is likely to be organic but the company remains open-minded about acquisitions.
""If a suitable opportunity arose we would certainly consider it... but we're not actively seeking acquisitions,"" said finance director Peter Foster.
Sales at the company's French life operations were expected to remain dull for the rest of this year and possibly early into 1998 as the reorganisation of the sales force continued.
First quarter new sales figure in France, where new single premium business fell 16 percent, disappointed many.
The reorganisation, a rise in interest rates and strong 1996 first quarter comparisons were among the factors blamed for the shortfall.
Commercial union continues to eye further opportunities in eastern Europe after the success of its Polish operations and will start writing business in the Czech Republic later this year. ($ = 0.613 British Pounds)

38,"The London Stock Exchange launched its new integrated trading and information computer system, Sequence 6, on Tuesday, the last stage in a three-year programme to take the London stock market into the next century.
The new system completes the introduction of electronic trading begun at the time of the Big Bang' shake up of the London market in 1986.
It also paves the way for the shift to electronic trading in Britain's largest shares on the transition from quote-driven trading for FTSE 100 stocks next summer.
""We are delighted that Sequence 6 has been implemented successfully, on time and under budget. The launch has gone very well today and the users appear to be very happy,"" said a spokeswoman for the Exchange.
However some market-makers in London said they experienced problems in posting prices on Tuesday, citing difficulties with the Reuters system.
A Reuters spokesman said the company's link to Sequence 6 was operating as planned but that there was an unrelated temporary operational problem with feeds from several European exchanges including London which affected prices in the morning.
The completion of the Sequence programme at a cost of 81 million pounds marks the culmination of an modernisation process by the Exchange and Andersen Consulting which will provide the flexibility to adapt to the future needs of the market place.
It will help ensure that London retains its competitive edge, and reduce ongoing costs for both the Exchange and its participants, the Exchange said.
Sequence 6 will provide the basis for new electronic trading in FTSE 100 shares once the structure of a new order-driven regime is agreed and implemented in 1997.
That will signal the end of the current, quote-driven system where prices are set exclusively by dealers authorised to act as ""market-makers"" and deals struck over the telephone.
It will also enable electronic as well as telephone-based trading in the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and the Seats -- Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service -- market for less liquid stocks.
During extensive market testing over five weekends this summer, the new trading platform succesfully coped with up to five times the average levels of daily activity in the London market, the Exchange said.
The Exchange entered into the outsourcing agreement with Andersen in April 1992 and today's launch marks the final phase of a four-stage delivery process.
The successful completion of the project, on time and nearly five million pounds ahead of budget, will come as a relief to the Exchange after its ill-fated and costly attempt at building a paperless share settlement system - TAURUS - was abandoned four years ago.
The collapse of the project resulted in the resignation of then chief executive Peter Rawlins and subsequent involvement of the Bank of England in supervising the development of Crest, a replacement for the Exchange's antiquated Talisman system.
It may also mark a turnaround in its fortunes after a year which began with the sacking of its chief executive, Michael Lawrence, amid disagreement over how to counter competition from overseas bourses.

38,"Scottish Amicable on Thursday asked for firm offers for the company to be tabled by the end of February as it emerged that more potential bidders had joined the auction for the mutually-owned insurance group.
Three companies were already known to have signed confidentiality agreements which give access to ScotAm's books - Abbey National, Prudential Corp and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP).
But a source close to the deal said that others had also signed the agreements and that potential bidders were now ""certainly more than three.""
ScotAm said that all interested parties would be requested to table firm offers by February 28.
A spokesman for ScotAm declined to comment on either the number or the identity of companies who had signed the confidentiality agreements.
One possibility is Dutch insurance group Aegon whose acquistion of Scottish Equitable has already demonstrated its ability to provide extra capital to develop the business according to industry experts.
Another firm rumoured to have contemplated a bid, Belgian-Dutch insurer Fortis is reported to have ruled a bid out and Lloyds TSB said earlier this week it was not interested in bidding.
Lloyds chief executive Peter Ellwood said that the company had run a slide-rule over ScotAm but that the bid premium looked too high.
Meanwhile, The Scotsman newspaper on Thursday reported that AMP is considering moving its Bristol-based subsidiary London Life to Scotland if its Scottish Amicable bid is successful.
The paper said that AMP would use Scotland to expand into Europe, and that it placed considerable importance on the Glasgow office of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers (SAIM).
The Prudential and Abbey National are believed to have plans to downscale or close SAIM, the paper said.
Following the receipt of bids, ScotAm will hold further discussions after which bidders will be required to submit final, binding proposals.
At the end of the process, the board will recommend a single proposal and an announcement of the recommended acquiror is expected to be made by the end of March.
Under the terms of the confidentiality agreements the decision of the board is final.
""We believe the process we are publishing today will maximise value for policyholders and will be seen to have done so,"" ScotAm's chairman Sandy Stewart said.
In a move which may help deflect criticism of the sealed bid process, ScotAm said it would make firm offers public, if required to do so by a bidder.
In addition, the Department of Trade &amp; Industry and an independent actuary will be consulted fully prior to the announcement of the recommended offer.
ScotAm will also outline the board's reasons for its recommendation, the criteria used and summarise the relevant information on all ""competitive proposals"".
The circular to policyholders outlining the final bid is likely some time in May.
Abbey National sparked the auction at the end of January when it announced it was prepared to pay up to 1.4 billion pounds for ScotAm, barely two weeks after ScotAm unveiled its own proposals to drop mutual status and float on the stock market.
The Abbey offer was topped a week later by the Pru's 1.9 billion bid.
Both companies have said that their offers may be raised when they have more detailed financial information on ScotAm.

38,"British composite insurer Commercial Union Plc posted a strong rise in first quarter profits on Wednesday, helped by a sharp fall in U.S. weather claims.
Chief executive John Carter described the company's prospects as ""excellent"" but the shares trimmed 10-1/2 pence to 739 pence after the figures, which were in the middle of analysts' forecast range.
Pre-tax operating profits rose to 102 million pounds ($166.4 million), up from 83 million pounds last year.
Excluding the negative impact of sterling, profits were up 46 percent. On the same basis profits and new business sales at the group's worldwide life business rose 25 percent.
Net assets per ordinary share were up 23 pence over the quarter to 568 pence.
Echoing comments made by General Accident which reported on Tuesday, Commercial Union said the rating environment remained competitive in UK general insurance though there was evidence of firming in certain classes of business.
A fall in weather losses helped U.S. results and France and Australia also saw increases in profits.
Weather claims in the U.S. fell 23 million pounds over the period to 6 million pounds as a result of the milder winter.
Finance director Peter Foster dismissed recent concerns about exposure to possible U.S. tobacco-related insurance claims.
""Commercial Union has very limited exposure to tobacco. We believe our policies have clear exclusion clauses and our exposure is not significant,"" Foster told Reuters.
In the UK, weather costs were broadly flat.
But the incidence of subsidence, a result of the dry start to the year, rose over the quarter. Claims were up 11 percent while the cost increased to 11 million pounds from seven million pounds in the first quarter last year.
General insurance profits rose to 67 million pounds, up three million pounds over 1996 but continuing competition in the UK reduced general insurance profits there.
""The UK rating environment remains competitive though there is evidence of rates trying to move upwards - particularly in motor classes,"" Foster said.
""Other rates are relatively stable on the personal lines side. On commercial lines the market remains competitive but the rate of reduction being seen has actually declined.""
In the U.S. general insurance also remained competitive with overall average rate increases broadly in line with inflation.
France was seeing rises in certain classes but areas such as motor cover were becoming more difficult, said Foster.
Asked about disappointing first quarter new sales in France where new single premium business fell 16 percent, Foster said he was confident about the quality of the business and the prospects for the future.
French first quarter 1996 figures had been very strong and a rise in interest rates and reorganisation of the sales force had not helped comparisons, he said.
With the acquisition of 73 percent of SEV, a French life assurer in April, life operations now account for around 50 percent of total group premium income.
This is likely to continue to rise in the future, said Foster.
""Life business tends to grow at a faster rate than general and we expect that to continue in the future. A lot of the growth will be organic. We can achieve a pretty high level of organic growth but if a suitable opportunity arose we would certainly consider it,"" he said.
Life profits over the quarter increased to 62 million pounds from 58 million pounds last year, with strong performances from the UK, the Netherlands and France.
The company had an open mind about a life acquisition, said Foster, but it was not actively seeking them.

2,"Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd could face a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit over the ownership of its spectacular Busang gold deposit in Indonesia.
The young Calgary-based company said Friday that one of its Indonesian partners, PT Krueng Gasui, threatened it and 19 others with legal action in Canadian courts, claiming damages of US$1.9 billion.
""I find it curious that PT Krueng Gasui has chosen to threaten a lawsuit in Canada relating to matters that allegedly occurred in Indonesia,"" Bre-X chief executive David Walsh said in a statement. ""However, we will sit down with them and listen to what they have to say.""
Krueng Gasui owns an undisputed 10 percent of one section of the Busang discovery. It claims it owns up to 40 percent of the entire deposit, but Bre-X says the Indonesian company does not have the documentation to back up its claims.
Bre-X, which closed down C$1 at 20.90 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, said Friday it had received a letter from its Indonesian partner demanding a meeting before November 22 to resolve the dispute. If Bre-X refuses or does not make an attempt to settle the argument, Krueng Gasui will sue, the letter said.
Bre-X said it has asked its lawyers to arrange a meeting.
""In my opinion, this (threat of a lawsuit) appears to be a last minute act of desperation,"" said gold analyst Chad Williams of Research Capital Corp.
""My question is, why have they waited so long? And why did they choose to do this in Canada?""
The dispute between Bre-X and Krueng Gasui, who is backed by Australia's Golden Valley Mines NL, became public at the beginning of October.
The argument prompted the Indonesian government to delay issuing vital contracts of work until the two parties worked out their difficulties. Without the contracts, Bre-X cannot proceed with work on Busang and has had to stall its search for a major gold producer to operate or buy the discovery, analysts say.
""The key is how the Indonesian government will react"" to the lawsuit, said Williams.
The threat of a lawsuit gives Bre-X a strong incentive to settle with Krueng Gasui and Indonesian businessman Jusuf Merukh, who controls Krueng Gasui, said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital.
While most analysts said it was too early to tell whether the Indonesian case would stand up in Canadian court, they said the threat of a lawsuit will definitely force Bre-X to treat the claims more seriously.
""It reinforces the uncertainty with respect to Bre-X,"" said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements. ""My sense is this thing is not going away. This is more of a manoeuvring than an actual threat, but it does not look like this will end any time soon.""
Krueng Gasui said in its letter that it will also sue the other Indonesian partners of Bre-X, some Bre-X officers and Canada's Minorca Resources Inc., which has a small stake in the discovery.
Minorca president Roland Horst said his company has no reason to be involved.
Exploration at Busang has outlined 47 million ounces of gold so far, and some analysts predict there could be up to 100 million ounces.

2,"Officials from the world's biggest trading partners agreed Friday to push a deal on opening up financial services markets to the top of the agenda in talks to liberalise global trade.
The leaders also emphasised the importance of bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation as quickly as possible ""on commercially viable terms.""
The financial services talks are ""the most urgent, major priority in terms of negotiations for the world trade community,"" Leon Brittan, European Union Trade Commissioner, told a news conference after two days of talks between the so-called Quad partners -- Canada, Japan, the United States and the European Union.
""I believe that the Quad meeting has given a shot in the arm"" to negotiations on financial services, Brittan said.
The Quad members agreed to put forward requests by mid-June and offers no later than July 14 to work towards a financial services deal. They hope to wrap up negotiations in December.
""That should be an example to the rest of the world and a platform on which to build,"" Brittan said.
But he and the other leaders pointed out the need for countries in Asia and Latin America to put together improved offers to the World Trade Organisation. Last year the United States pulled out of talks on financial services because of its disappointment in the offers from other countries.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in a letter last week to a number of his counterparts, said a successful financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice.
It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial services providers, he said.
The four trading chiefs also called for bringing China and Russia into the World Trade Organisation quickly.
The Quad members said they were united in their belief that China, in particular, should be brought into the global trading forum as long as Beijing committed itself to the global trading system and open market access.
""We are not going to push on the accelerator for political reasons, and we are not going to put on the brakes for political reasons,"" Brittan said.
Officials said the Quad members would like new members, especially China, to sign on to a recent pact to eliminate tariffs on various information technologies by 2000.
The forum provided an opportunity for the four countries to discuss bilateral trade issues with each other.
The European Union expressed concern about the implementation of a 1992 agreement with the United States limiting subsidies to aircraft industries.
""We do not accept that proposition at all, at the same time the United States has some concerns about European practices,"" U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told reporters after a morning meeting with Brittan.
Barshefsky said U.S. and EU officials would continue discussions on the issue in June, but that the United States would not agree to any emergency consultations.
Barshefsky also had a strong word with Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton over Canada's new copyright law which taxes blank cassettes and distributes the royalties to performers. U.S. performers, however, will not receive any money since the United States has not signed an international copyright agreement.
""We think there is a national treatment problem here,"" Barshefsky said, referring to one country's preferential treatment for its citizens. She said the United States would consider taking trade action against Canada over the law.
But Eggleton said Canada was well within its rights and obligations with the copyright law.

2,"Some of the world's most influential gold producers are upping the ante as Wednesday's deadline edges closer for Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to make a deal with gold giant Barrick Gold Corp.
At stake is the rich Busang gold deposit in Indonesia. New estimates released Tuesday suggest the discovery contains more than 57 million ounces of gold that can be mined at the low cost of $96 an ounce.
The Indonesian government has virtually mandated that Bre-X must carve up its find, with Barrick getting 75 percent of Bre-X's stake and Bre-X 25 percent.
And the government of President Suharto has also made it plain it would ""appreciate"" a stake of 10 percent in Busang.
But now, some major figures in the gold mining world are protesting that the deal ordered by Indonesia is unprecedented and unfair. They are pressuring Jakarta to allow rival bids.
""I think it's Bre-X's natural right to have a say who their partner will be,"" John Willson, chief executive officer of Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc., said.
Placer Dome, Canada's second biggest gold company and one of the world's largest, wants to bid on Busang, and Willson said Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp. have also been at the negotiating table for months.
The three heavyweight mining companies were abruptly shut out of the process last month when Indonesia forced Bre-X into Barrick's arms.
Analysts have speculated that Barrick used its business connections with Suharto's eldest daughter, as well as connections through former U.S. President George Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Barrick advisers, to sway the Indonesian government.
""We were clearly disappointed -- that's a nice way of putting it -- that all of a sudden the thing went away from us,"" Willson said. ""Something has been going on that is not kosher in the West.""
Willson said he thought the Indonesian government could be persuaded to consider other offers for Busang. Otherwise, the country would face international condemnation and risk losing foreign investment, he said.
""This is indeed unusual. The message to the whole market is we risk our money big time to find gold, and if we really find the jackpot, somebody's going to come along and tell us what to do with it.
""It would put a great big red flag on Indonesia.""
Placer, Newmont and Teck must now await word from Jakarta on whether they will be allowed back into the bidding process.
Indonesia's consulate in Toronto declined to comment on the matter Tuesday. Newmont Mining also would not comment.
Teck's chief financial officer, John Taylor, said the company would consider bidding for Busang if Indonesia opened the door to an auction process, but would likely seek a partner in any bid.
""That's a pretty big bite,"" Taylor said.
Willson, however, noted Placer Dome could comfortably afford to take on Busang alone, despite a recent $600 million bid for a larger stake in Papua New Guinea's Porgera gold deposit.
He would not say what price Placer was willing to offer, but ""it's clearly worth considerably more that what's being contemplated,"" he said after looking at the new resource calculations for Busang.
The resource calculations are in line with analysts' expectations, said mining analyst Bruno Kaiser with CIBC-Wood Gundy in Toronto, who noted that most analysts believe Busang holds a lot more gold than has already been outlined.
Kaiser said he was not concerned about the Dec. 4 deadline ticking past without news from Jakarta.
""My take on it is that the Indonesian government imposed this Dec. 4 deadline primarily as a means to facilitate bids and get the process moving,"" he said. ""You get everyone who is interested and serious stepping up.""
But analyst Catherine Gignac with Deacon Capital in Toronto expressed doubts about the Indonesian government soliciting more suitors for Bre-X. ""Why should the Indonesian government provide the market with a bidding process just because we want them to?"" she said.
North America's gold miners are not alone in seeking a piece of Busang. Bre-X's Indonesian partner Jusuf Merukh has claimed up to 40 percent of the deposit. And the former Australian owners of the property say they also have rights to part of the riches.

2,"The Indonesian gold bug is nibbling away at Inco Ltd, the world's biggest nickel company.
The company whose name has become synonymous with nickel is turning its sights to gold, copper and zinc exploration in Indonesia, Africa, Canada's Far North, Turkey and Brazil.
""Our target exploration area is Indonesia,"" Bob Horn, Inco's vice-president of exploration, said in a recent interview.
""We've reassessed what we're doing, we've refocused on our work,"" he said.  
""When we got rid of TVX, it was sold at a substantial profit...It was not a strategic move to get out of gold. It was a strategic move to get out of that particular company,"" Horn said.
""There's nothing wrong with gold. If it makes money, we'll be there.""
Inco does not have any plans to go head-to-head with the world's huge gold producers, however.
""They always pay too much, but if we come across a situation where we find gold, we'll go for it, like we have in Indonesia,"" Horn said.  
The company has budgeted US$24.8 million for field exploration in 1997, slightly less than the US$25 million in 1996. But three recent alliances mean up to an extra US$15 million will be devoted to exploration through the junior partners, Horn said.
In addition to its alliance with Colony Pacific, Inco also has an arrangement with Carlin Resources Corp to explore in Africa, and a third deal in the works.
The company has just about all the nickel it needs with continued exploration in Canada at the huge and expanding Voisey's Bay deposit in remote Labrador as well as growing mines in Thomson, Manitoba and Sudbury, Ontario.
Instead, Inco hopes to grow through an exploration focus on copper, zinc and gold, Horn said.
In 1995, Inco did not produce any zinc, but it produced 240 million pounds of copper, 3.775 million pounds of cobalt, 60,000 troy ounces of gold and 403 million pounds of nickel.  
""We already market copper, so it's no big deal to us,"" said Horn. ""And the technology for zinc is pretty well the same. We don't have to develop any new expertise to get into zinc.""
But gold?
Inco got rid of most of its gold in 1993, when it sold its controlling interest in TVX Gold Inc. Gold production since then has been minimal.
Inco kept many of its gold experts on staff, however, and Horn said the company has all the expertise it needs to mine gold.  
Analysts said Inco is wise to use its solid status and its 28-year history in Indonesia to explore the vast mineral potential there.
Inco, which has a huge nickel operation in Indonesia, has several exploration projects there and recently struck deals with Highlands Gold Ltd and Canadian explorer Colony Pacific Explorations Ltd to step up its search for gold and copper.
Alliances with smaller companies will be key to Inco's exploration in the future, Horn said.

2,"Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp. are trying to forge an alliance to mine the huge Busang gold deposit in Indonesia despite a cloud of uncertainty over the rights to the find, Bre-X's chief executive said Thursday.
But the negotiations with Barrick are progressing slowly, Bre-X Chief Executive Officer David Walsh told Reuters.
""We're moving ahead, albeit at a snail's pace,"" he said, adding that legal issues stood in the way of a full agreement. ""We're trying to get them to appreciate our views and the legal stance that we've taken.""
Last month the Indonesian government advised Bre-X to form a joint venture with Toronto-based Barrick to operate Busang. The government, which also requested a 10 percent stake, set a Dec. 4 deadline, but the two companies announced after that date that several issues remained outstanding.
Since then, the Indonesian government has raised doubts about Bre-X's grip on Busang, estimated to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold, worth about $21 billion at today's prices.
""The government has stopped processing the previous application for contracts of work by Bre-X because of various problems,"" Umar Said, Indonesia's secretary-general of mines, told Reuters in Jakarta on Thursday. ""Therefore the previous application by Bre-X that has been delayed must be stopped and must be said to have been cancelled.""
He said Bre-X and Barrick must jointly submit new applications for work on the deposit. Without contracts of work granted by the Indonesian government, Bre-X cannot proceed to exploit the find.
Walsh defended his company, saying its permits and applications for the gold property were ""in good standing.""
He said two Bre-X officials met with Umar in Jakarta Thursday and were assured everything was in line. ""The telephone call that I got from Rolie (Francisco), he was quite pleased with the meeting. He said we're making very good progress in our relationship (with the mines ministry),"" Walsh said.
Bre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty, explaining the apparent contradiction, said: ""What the government wants to do in essence is that if an agreement with Barrick is made, the existing applications will be replaced with new applications.""
Bre-X earlier said that Umar had apologised for the misunderstanding, saying his comments were ""erroneously reported in a Dec. 11 Reuters newswire article."" But Peter Thomas, a Reuter spokesman in London, said the international news and information company was confident the quotations in its Dec. 11 story from Jakarta were accurate.
Umar's comments to Reuters Thursday were essentially repeating what he said on Wednesday.
Despite a barrage of statements from Bre-X on Thursday, Barrick was still seeking clarification on the situation from the Indonesian government.
""We're still seeking clarification and we want to hear directly from the government of Indonesia,"" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in Toronto. ""We're not saying anything until we talk directly to the government of Indonesia.""
Bre-X, too, is waiting for the Indonesian government to make a move.
Walsh said he still had high hopes that Indonesian President Suharto would open up an auction for Busang, allowing other mining companies to bid on the project. He said Bre-X had not made a formal request for an auction, but added: ""We understand that the president is reviewing the situation.""
An auction would be advantageous for Bre-X shareholders and for Indonesia, he said. ""We're not soliciting offers. We are getting other phone calls,"" Walsh said. ""I am talking to principals of other companies.""
He said he had spoken to executives at Placer Dome Inc., Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp.
In Vancouver, Placer Dome spokesman Hugh Leggatt said any suggestion of an open auction on Busang was encouraging. His company has made a formal request for an open bidding process.
But gold mining analyst Bill Belovay of CIBC Wood Gundy said Barrick's competitors may be trying to make a deal with Bre-X more expensive for Barrick. ""They're playing games,"" he said. ""One has got to read between the lines.""
Belovay said Busang was so fraught with uncertainty that he has a hard time understanding why the major gold producers would be interested. ""One doesn't even know what percentage (Barrick) will end up with. One doesn't even know how to keep Suharto happy,"" he said. ""To me it's a whole big nightmare.""
Investors were confused by Thursday's developments, analysts said.
Bre-X, whose stock was halted all day on Wednesday, fell 85 cents to C$19.80 in heavy trading of more than 8.6 million shares. Barrick, which lost C$2.75 on Wednesday, regained C$1 to C$39.50 in trading of more than 2 million shares.

2,"Gold giant Barrick Gold Corp. is negotiating with Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to gain control of Bre-X's huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, the two companies said on Tuesday.
The companies were negotiating under the ""guidance"" of the Indonesian government, which asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick, Bre-X said.
Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X discovered Busang, one of the world's biggest gold deposits, in 1994.
Official estimates of Busang have outlined 47 million ounces of gold so far, but analysts have said that number could rise to 100 million ounces.
""This is a result of Barrick working very hard behind the scenes to circumvent Bre-X's sale process,"" one analyst said of the news. Bre-X has been seeking a partnership with a major gold producer to operate Busang.
To satisfy Indonesia, Bre-X would keep 25 percent of its stake and 75 percent would go to Toronto-based Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer.
Bre-X said that the Indonesian government ""would appreciate it if the parties could consider a 10 percent participation being given to the Indonesian government.""
The Indonesian government wants Barrick and Bre-X to reach a deal by December 4 or else the government ""will take steps to prevent a delay in the development"" of Busang, Bre-X said.
Development of Busang has been held up by disputes between Bre-X and its Indonesian partners over ownership of the discovery.
Bre-X, which controls 90 percent of Busang, said it asked Indonesia's Mines Ministry if other deals would be acceptable, but had not yet received an answer.
A deal between the two companies was not a sure thing, Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in an interview.
He said he had no details about how much money or stock would change hands or when a deal would be reached.
With the Indonesian government guiding the Busang negotiations, Bre-X's powers to negotiate a favorable deal were curbed, analysts said.
""There have been some constraints imposed on Bre-X,"" said mining analyst Chad Williams at Research Capital Corp. in Montreal. ""That's going to negatively impact on how much Bre-X can receive for its interest.""
But Barrick has an international reputation at stake and will have to be seen to treat Bre-X fairly, analysts said.
""Given the possible questions that may be raised over how Barrick obtained this special status, it will be essential that they are viewed as treating Bre-X shareholders fairly in any negotiations going forward,"" said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.
Barrick shares soared on the news, gaining C$2.30 to C$38.85 by mid-afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They rose 2-1/4 to 29-3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bre-X shares fell in Toronto before the news and held steady in active trading at C$20.10, down C$2.45, after the market digested the news.
Its stock has been volatile lately, clouded by the ownership dispute over Busang.
Busang would set Barrick well on its way to achieving its dream of becoming the world's biggest gold company.
In 1995, the company -- already North America's largest -- produced 3.1 million ounces of gold and had gold reserves totaling 43.3 million ounces.
It has become increasingly aggressive in moving towards its goal, analysts said.
Last summer, Barrick acquired Arequipa Resources Ltd. and its promising Pierina gold property in Peru for about $800 million.

2,"Countries belonging to the World Trade Organization should be flexible and understanding about China's bid to join the WTO, the organization's director-general said on Saturday.
""As we approach the final stage of the Chinese accession process, there is a need for flexibility on all sides and a determination to resolve the crucial outstanding issues in the negotiations,"" Renato Ruggiero told trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
""The success of this negotiation is a shared responsibility, and it can be assured only if we keep up the momentum established earlier this year,"" Ruggiero said.
He said substantial progress is needed on rules issues and market access.
The APEC members said they wanted China and Russia to join the WTO quickly, as long as they join on commercially viable terms, officials said.
The world's major trading partners have suggested that China join last year's international agreement to open up trade in information technology before it acceeds to the 130-member World Trade Organization.
Ruggiero said that talks on financial services have become the WTO's top priority.
""A success in financial services is essential to help ensure each of you -- industrialized and developing countries alike -- the necessary infrastructure growth,"" Ruggiero told the Asia-Pacific trade ministers.
""My message is: do not see this negotiation in North/South terms,"" he continued. ""On the contrary, developing countries whatever their economic position, have an even stronger need than the industrial countries for competitive financial institutions.""
Ruggiero urged APEC to make sure a financial services deal is reached this year, to maintain momentum in international trade talks.
""Not to  do so should be as unthinkable as it would be short-sighted,"" Ruggiero said.
Last week, the United States, the European Union, Canada and Japan affirmed they would stick to the WTO schedule on financial services by putting forward their offers by mid-July.
On Saturday, the 18 APEC countries affirmed their support too, building strong momentum for a deal by the end of the year in the lucrative sector, officials said.
But U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers. The United States pulled out of previous attempts to broker free trade in financial services because of its disappointment in offers from other countries.
The meeting between the WTO leader and the APEC trade ministers confirmed APEC's role as a regional catalyst for action within the WTO, trade officials said.
But Hong Kong expressed its concern about the WTO's dumping code, while Korea and Japan said they were worried about an onslaught of agriculture products flooding their markets from lesser developed countries because of WTO regulations, officials said.

2,"Canada's election campaign shifted into high gear on Tuesday as party leaders prepared for the French-language debate after a relentless attack on Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chretien in Monday's English debate.
The troubling issue of Quebec independence will be in the forefront of Tuesday night's French debate among the leaders of the five major parties, ahead of the June 2 election.
""When it gets into (national) unity, there's an emotional attachment there that has to be responded to,"" Reform Party leader Preston Manning said on Tuesday. ""I believe it is emerging as one of the defining issues.""
Manning scored points in the English debate when he attacked Chretien for bringing Canada to the brink of separation.
Quebeckers narrowly voted to keep their French-speaking province in Canada in Quebec's 1995 sovereignty referendum, by 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent, despite assurances by Chretien that a solid vote against separation was virtually assured.
""You almost blew it, sir,"" Manning told Chretien. ""You do not deserve a second chance.""
But Manning faces a challenge as he tries to get his national unity message across in the French debate. Since he speaks only English, his participation will be limited to addresses at the beginning and the end of the debate.
The pressure is also on Gilles Duceppe, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, who must shine during the French debate after a low-key performance in the English debate.
The Bloc became Canada's main opposition party in the last election in 1993, despite its aim to partition the country.
But the Bloc's grip on Quebec is threatened by early campaign gaffes and a new controversy over whether Quebec's separatist government would have unilaterally declared independence if it had won the 1995 referendum.
Duceppe, Chretien and Conservative leader Jean Charest -- all Quebeckers -- were expected to dominate the French debate. Alexa McDonough, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party will also participate.
Charest stirred the English studio audience to applause on Monday when he proclaimed: ""I intend to make this country work, because if there's one commitment I made to my children, it's that I'm going to pass on to them the country I received from my parents.""
He said on Tuesday that he expected to be the main target during the French debate.
""Tonight I think you'll see them very aggressive with regards to my own participation,"" he told a morning news conference.
The Liberals have a huge lead in opinion polls, with the backing of between 42 and 47 percent of decided voters.

2,"Fears of a U.S. interest rate hike battered Canadian financial markets this week, but Canada's top central banker gave no hint on Friday whether he might raise Canada's rates in reply to any Fed action.    ""There will always be aan
impact on Canada of an international change in interest rates,"" Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen told reporters after a speech to economists.
""But the difference I think now is that we have got more room to maneuver than we did before. But you should not interpret that as saying what we are going to do next week or not,"" he added.
The Canadian dollar and fixed income markets were rattled this week by investor concerns that the Federal Reserve would hike U.S. interest rates next Tuesday while the Bank of Canada is expected to hold rates steady.
Thiessen said nothing on Friday to ease market fears.
""He's saying inflation is under control and there is no reason for rates to rise,"" said Warren Jestin, chief economist for Bank of Nova Scotia.
However, economists predicted the central bank might eventually yield to pressure to tighten monetary conditions in Canada if the Canadian dollar continues to weaken.
The Bank of Canada dropped short-term interest rates 11 times last year compared with just one U.S. rate cut.
The lower rates and low inflation can be thanked for strengthening Canada's economy, Thiessen said on Friday, predicting strong growth for jobs and production in the year ahead.
""The Canadian economy should have room for strong above-potential rates of growth in output and employment in coming quarters without a resurgence in inflation,"" he said.
""The margin of unused capacity in our economy will shrink substantially over the next couple of years,"" he said.
Thiessen agreed with a Royal Bank forecast that 700,000 new jobs would be created over the next two years. And he predicted a return of consumer confidence and surging private sector growth.
Thiessen said he sees a strong Canadian dollar in the long term, citing a report on Friday of low Canadian inflation.
Canada's core consumer price index for February rose 1.5 percent on the year, according to Statistics Canada, which puts inflation well within the central bank's target inflation range of one to three percent.

2,"Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton faces pressure at a meeting of Asia-Pacific officials that starts on Thursday to ensure concrete steps are taken to achieve free and open trade, analysts said.
Trade ministers from the 18 member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum are meeting through Saturday here to set the agenda for an APEC summit in Vancouver in November.
""There's a lot of pressure,"" said Karen Minden, director of the APEC Studies Foundation for Canada. ""People in the organisation have said if APEC doesn't catch the leaders' attention, then it won't get anywhere.""
Canada wants to show the world in November that the huge forum, which includes some of the world's richest countries and many developing countries, can be productive. Previous summits have been long on talk of reform but slow to promote free trade measures, critics say.
Canada, which as APEC chair this year will play a big role in directing the summit agenda, has a reputation for focusing on administration and structure rather than on trade reform.
But Eggleton probably will pick up on sectors discussed last week in Toronto at a conference of trade ministers from the United States, Japan, the European Union and Canada.
The so-called Quad countries agreed to make liberalisation of financial services a priority, with Canada optimistic about progress on trade in environmental products.
But APEC members should expect resistance from lesser developed Asian countries on financial services, said a Canadian trade specialist who asked not to be identified.
At the top of everyone's minds will likely be China's bid to join the World Trade Organisation, the trade expert said.
""The biggest issue will be in my view the WTO accession of China,"" the expert said in a phone interview.
At last week's Quad meeting, trade ministers said they wanted to bring China and Russia into the WTO quickly but wanted to assure Beijing was committed to the global trading system and open access to markets.
The APEC meeting will also provide an opportunity to test the waters for a new round of tariff cuts on wood, paper and other products, U.S. officials said.
APEC aims to achieve free and open trade and investment in the region between developed countries by 2010 and between all member countries by 2020.
APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

26,"Canadian envoys on Tuesday dismissed reports that thousands of Hong Kong people in Canada may be forced to flock home en masse ahead of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China in order to protect their residence rights.
Canada's commissioner in Hong Kong, Garrett Lambert, and the country's ambasador to China, Howard Balloch, said they believed China would soon decide on the issue, which has been a stumbling block in Sino-British talks on the territory.
But Lambert said Hong Kong people who had emigrated from the British colony might have to live in Hong Kong as Canadians in future and lose their local voting rights after it becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on July 1, 1997.
Lambert told reporters he had been informed by China's envoy in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, that progress was being made by Chinese and British negotiators on the problem of right of abode.
The question is one of the major unresolved issues facing the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which meets this Wednesday.
""This is a good file. It's one on which progress is being made. Mr Zhou said he expected that we would have a decision announced in the JLG soon -- my guess is probably in early January,"" Lambert said.
""It now seems fairly obvious that you do not have to be physically present in Hong Kong to protect your interests if you are already a permanent resident of Hong Kong before the transition,"" he said.
However, Lambert said questions remained about political and working rights of Hong Kong emigrants who return to live in the territory after 1997.
Of all Western nations, Canada has one of the largest immigration relationships with Hong Kong.
Apart from some 500,000 Hong Kong people who have emigrated to Canada in recent years, some 30,000 Canadian citizens live in Hong Kong, many of them originally Hong Kong citizens.
Press reports in Hong Kong have quoted British officials warning of a chaotic mass return of Hong Kong emigrants if China insists on them being in Hong Kong in person on the July 1 handover day in order to keep their residence rights.
Chinese officials have said in the past that this would be their bottom line, but the JLG has reached no agreement on it.
Canada has delayed a decision on granting visa-free entry to holders of a new Hong Kong passport to be issued after the handover, pending guarantees from China on the repatriation of Chinese who enter Canada illegally.
Replying to a reporter on Tuesday, Lambert denied Canada had any grounds to believe the SAR passport had been compromised from a security viewpoint.
Balloch declined to confirm or deny that significant numbers of Chinese illegal immigrants had entered Canada using Hong Kong documents that were illegally issued or obtained.
The envoys also denied local press reports that Canada had received a comprehensive list of Chinese dissidents living in exile in Hong Kong, and that it planned to grant them refuge after 1997. They said some individual dissidents had come forward but declined to comment further.
"
26,"Its tough line unshaken by the death of leader Deng Xiaoping, China pressed ahead on Monday with a controversial plan to roll back political freedoms in Hong Kong, drawing a rebuke from colonial Governor Chris Patten.
Deng, who died last week, was the architect of the ""one country two systems"" formula for the conversion of Hong Kong into a special, autonomous capitalist zone of China when British rule ends at midnight on June 30.
Despite widespread misgivings about China in this bustling territory of 6.4 million people, thousands of residents paid their respects to Deng for the fourth day on Monday in a mourning ceremony at a shrine inside China's official mission.
On Sunday night, China's parliament approved a plan to throw out or amend a clutch of Hong Kong laws, including those that provide for democratic elections and protect civil liberties.
The plan trims back the bill of rights, the law on forming political parties and another on free association which takes a liberal approach to public protests and demonstrations.
The laws were part of London's effort to sow the seeds of democracy in the twilight of more than 150 years of British rule. China has accused Britain of violating the 1984 Sino-British handover treaty.
Patten accused China's National People's Congress of turning a deaf ear to the wishes of most Hong Kong people.
""(Sunday's decision) casts doubt on the freedoms and autonomy which have been promised to Hong Kong and the rule of law on which they are based... It will cause legal confusion and invite legal challenge,"" Patten said.
""It is already crystal clear that what the community wants to see is the preservation of Hong Kong's current civil liberties...""
Sunday's decision was also attacked by Hong Kong's Democratic Party, the largest in the territory's legislature.
""China's latest move means the die is now very much cast,"" a spokesman for the party told Reuters.
""China has shown it is not going to respect the will of Hong Kong people. The NPC is a political body making a decision that will remake Hong Kong in blatant breach of handover agreements which say Hong Kong's laws shall remain unchanged.""
He said the move violated the internationally registered 1984 Sino-British handover treaty, called the Joint Declaration, and Hong Kong's future constitution, the Basic Law.
Beijing's move to crimp basic freedoms flies in the face of official protests by Britain.
London has challenged China to go to the World Court to seek a ruling on the legality of China's plan to replace Hong Kong's elected Legco with an appointed provisional legislature.
In a related development, a leading Hong Kong member of the Preparatory Committee on the handover said Hong Kong would not be allowed to amend new election rules that his panel was preparing for the territory.
Neither Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting, Tung Chee-hwa, the provisional legislature, nor the post-colonial government, could change the rules, Lau Siu-kai said.
Slightly over half of Preparatory Committee members are from Hong Kong and the rest are from the mainland. Its decisions generally echo policy statements by senior Beijing officials.
The rules would govern the first election of a long-term legislature some time in 1998 to replace a provisional body that China has appointed to make laws from July 1.

26,"A former top judge who is vying to lead Hong Kong after China takes over next year has said the territory needs a neutral and impartial leader rather than a well-connected tycoon, and one who is tolerant towards dissent.
""I'm for tolerance,"" Yang Ti Liang, one of three candidates trying to become Hong Kong's first chief executive after Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight next June 30, told Reuters in an interview.
The 67-year-old Shanghai-born former chief justice, who shed his British knighthood a month ago, came through this month's first round of voting by a 400-strong China-backed Selection Committee with 82 of the votes.
He was well behind frontrunner Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping tycoon with strong China links who scored 206 votes, but ahead of another entrepreneur, Peter Woo, who scraped through with 54.
Tung has often been depicted as Beijing's favourite in the race. But Yang, who has emerged as the people's favourite in some recent opinion polls, and once with a lead of as many as 10 percentage points, is battling on, even though there will be no public vote for the top post.
""Of course the votes indicated that certainly the Selection Committee favours Tung much more than they favour me. It's an uphill battle. It's not easy. But I think there's still hope,"" Yang said.
Over the coming week candidates will be quizzed by committee members on their policies ahead of their final vote on December 11.
Asked if the committee was likely to heed his popularity with the public, Yang said: ""I think to a certain extent it will. I don't think they will follow the poll to the letter. If there's a vast difference shown between candidates in the polls, the committee will have to take note.""
Yang's campaign headquarters is a modest, cramped office rented in a hotel, in marked contrast the plush executive suites occupied by Tung. The ""campaign"" is a crusade to lobby business and interest groups, not the general public.
Yang described his greatest strength in comparison with Tung as his long experience as a fair, unbiased arbiter.
""I have no business connections or political connections ... having been a judge for the past 30 years. I am somebody above politics, above connections, neutral, impartial, as opposed to somebody who is very much in business and whose contact with the Chinese government is very good,"" he said.
""I think anybody who has a huge network with other people does give rise to the problem as to whether, if eventually selected, he might not be perceived to be influenced by these connections when making a decision.""
Yang said Hong Kong's future leader would not face a test of courage in standing up to Beijing's communist rulers to resist pressure for a crackdown on anti-communist dissenters and pro-democracy activists.
""It's not a question of being brave or not brave. It's a question of looking at the letter of the law and seeing what it allows,"" he said. ""I want to be on the side of tolerance.""
He said he hoped a law on sedition, treason and subversion required by Beijing would not be enacted by the controversial interim legislature that China plans to install at the handover, but by a new long-term legislature to be elected in 1998.
Yang also said he believed the Chinese Communist Party, which has long operated underground and behind the scenes in Hong Kong, should register as a party under local law if it planned to be active in the territory after 1997.

26,"Human rights and political liberty took centre stage in Hong Kong on Tuesday as human rights watchdogs said China was making it easier to crush dissent, boding ill for the territory after Beijing takes over.
After 156 years under the British flag, Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 -- 63 days away -- and the pace of politics is quickening.
The watchdog Human Rights Watch/Asia said changes to China's criminal code had made it easier for Beijing to stifle dissent, and Hong Kong people might even be put on trial in China.
In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks on contentious issues but there was no shift in views on human rights or the future of Hong Kong, a Chinese spokesman said.
A major ""public consultation"" on the future of political freedom in the colony ends on Wednesday, and the bustling capitalist outpost's 6.4 million people are sharply divided.
The pulse-taking launched by future leader Tung Chee-hwa asks members of the public and organisations to submit views on his plan to ban foreign funding of political groups and curb the right to protest in the interests of ""national security"".
Pro-democracy parties, the legal profession, human rights groups, Western-style trade unions and churches have all vigorously objected to the plan in written submissions, and there has been loud criticism from London and Washington.
But organisations representing industry, commerce, pro-China political parties and pro-Beijing trade unions support Tung's plan, which was forced on him in March by a Chinese parliamentary resolution.
In the latest twist, a powerful pro-Beijing labour group, the Federation of Trade Unions, urged a widening of definitions of political groups covered by the curbs.
But in an unusual move, the federation also called for a ban on funding from China's ruling Communist Party to local political groups to be added to the restrictions.
""This will avoid disputes and criticisms. Hong Kong's political groups should stand on their own feet to fight for their beliefs,"" said the union's boss, Cheng Yiu-tong.
Cheng's rival, pro-democracy trade union federation leader Lee Cheuk-yan, attacked Cheng's bid to widen the net.
""(It) is a step backward, because they want to have more organisations defined as political groups,"" Lee told Reuters. ""They want to pressure these organisations to depoliticise.""
Tung's future Justice Secretary, Elsie Leung, said she was willing to consider calls for a ban on mainland funding.
Such funding had not originally been mentioned because it was considered that the national security interests of Hong Kong and mainland organisations converged.
""But we will consider this proposal as so many people have raised it,"" she said at a function on Monday.
Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a major report on Tuesday that China's striking of the term ""counterrevolution"", the communist code for subversion, from the law books in March did not mean easing political controls. Quite the opposite.
""China has merely replaced the term 'counterrevolution' with the equally elastic notion of 'endangering state security' and has, in the process, actually broadened the capacity of the state to suppress dissent,"" the report said.
Hong Kong people, who China has vowed can keep their legal system and way of life for 50 years, could suffer, it said.
""The new security provisions will facilitate the labelling of all domestic critics as tools of 'hostile foreign forces',"" it said. ""Despite Hong Kong's separate legal system, Beijing may have the power to bring Hong Kong people to face trial in mainland courts.""

26,"After a week of nervousness over its future freedoms, Hong Kong watched on Friday for the outcome of a Beijing gathering that will set the tone for the post-colonial government that takes over in 1997.
The Preparatory Committee of pro-China figures from Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials was meeting in Beijing for two days to elect a 400-member caucus that will pick Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader and parliament.
The exercise will quicken the pace of the British colony's transition to Chinese rule in 242 days' time.
In the latest step in Britain's pull-out, Gurkha soldiers who were the backbone of the colonial garrison were set to bid a ceremonial farewell to one of their Hong Kong bases on Friday night.
Hong Kong was jarred this week by fears of a crackdown by China after the handover in view of the jailing in Beijing of prominent dissident Wang Dan.
The colony was also unnerved by remarks this month by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, chairman of the Beijing meeting, that freedom of expression in Hong Kong would be limited after the sovereignty transfer at midnight next June 30.
On Thursday, a further jolt came when China barred entry to two Hong Kong politicians who wanted to petition the Beijing meeting against some of China's Hong Kong policies.
On Friday two more Hong Kong activists were expelled from Beijing.
On the eve of the Beijing meeting, a pro-China lobby group published a survey showing that most Hong Kong businessmen expected press freedom, the political system and human rights to deteriorate after the handover.
Some 72 percent expected less press freedom, 64 percent expected the political system to suffer, and 63 percent saw a deterioration in human rights, the survey by the Better Hong Kong Foundation showed.
A leading candidate to become the future leader of Hong Kong, former Chief Justice Ti Liang Yang, sought to allay fears this week that the territory would be forced to accept tough, Chinese-style laws on sedition after 1997.
""If you simply chant a few lines which do not incite any illegal acts, or which you don't expect to cause others to act radically, it should not be a problem,"" Yang said on Thursday.
But Yang and three other leading contenders for the top job were attacked by Hong Kong's leading democracy group for failing to condemn Wang Dan's 11-year jail sentence, saying they were ignoring local people's anger.
""They are not just angry about the fate of Wang Dan, what they are most worried about is whether Article 23 of the Basic Law will become a tool to curb their freedom of speech after the handover,"" said Szeto Wah, deputy head of the Democratic Party.
The Selection Committee make-up is expected to be announced on Saturday. The body will meet in Hong Kong next month to select the Chief Executive who will succeed colonial Governor Chris Patten next July.
"
26,"Shipping boss Tung Chee-hwa emerged as the most vocally pro-China contender for Hong Kong's leadership on Friday as a Beijing-controlled body wrapped up a three-day quiz of three men vying to rule Hong Kong after 1997.
The Selection Committee of 400 rich or influential Hong Kong people, who were picked under China's close supervision, will now ponder. But many believe Tung is the preordained winner.
The committee meets again on December 11 to make its choice.
Tung shot off a volley of comments and answers to committee members underlining his loyalty to China, attacked the politics of British Governor Chris Patten, and even threw in a snub about the inauspicious qualities of Patten's official residence.
Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at the stroke of midnight next June 30 after more than 150 years as a British colony.
Beijing is turning the territory of 6.3 million people into a Special Administrative Region of communist China, pledging no change to its thriving capitalist system for 50 years.
The committee's choice of a chief executive to succeed Patten was obvious, the pro-business Economic Journal said on Friday. ""We get the feeling that winner and loser in the chief executive contest is already decided,"" it said.
Tung Chee-hwa's answers were all ""politically correct"", showing a ""cautious nature"" that suited the taste of Beijing and many Hong Kong people, the journal said.
In his remarks, Tung jumped to China's defence and attacked an attempt by Britain this week to introduce a pre-emptive soft subversion law before the 1997 handover aimed at ensuring no China-style jailings of dissidents take place after 1997.
""It is up to the future government to draw up its own law on these matters,"" Tung said. ""The Special Administrative Region government will have to review these issues after the handover.""
Tung, 59, who quit as head of the Orient Overseas shipping empire to bid for Hong Kong's leadership, has been tipped as China's favoured son since Chinese President Jiang Zemin singled him out for a handshake in Beijing in January.
In the three days of committee interrogation, much of which was broadcast live, Tung's rivals -- former chief judge Ti Liang Yang and entrepreneur Peter Woo -- also gave voice to patriotism but were glaringly less pro-China in their utterances.
Yang made clear he would not always bend with Beijing's wind or whim, but would follow the letter of Hong Kong law.
""I'm for Yang because he's for justice,"" said a Hong Kong Chinese resident listening to the sessions on the radio.
""He's a fair man. He's not a merchant,"" he said, summing up a widely held view of the contest.
Tung said Hong Kong might have to make sacrifices if China fell victim to political or diplomatic sanctions.
He stressed Chinese cultural values and patriotic education and the need for less red tape, speedier land development approvals, a sell-off of low-price public housing to tenants, and setting an example of Chinese reunification for Taiwan to follow later.
""I found it abominable...I found him more colonial than the colonial government,"" said legislator Tsang Kin-shing.
Tsang, whose Democratic Party is boycotting the leadership contest, said Tung's rivals were no better. ""They are all foul grass growing from a foul jar,"" he said, using a colloquial Chinese insult.
Tung also said he would not like to move into the governor's traditional residence next year. ""I have heard the Government House is crowded and the fung shui is not good.""
Many Hong Kong Chinese cling to fung shui, ""wind and water"", a mixture of science and superstition that people use to chart their lives, birthdays, weddings, business and burials.
"
26,"On the eve of an historic gathering of the elite assembled by China to pick Hong Kong's future leader, the smart money was on Tung Chee-hwa.
Most observers viewed it as a foregone conclusion that the shipping tycoon would emerge the winner after the 400-strong Selection Committee of Hong Kong business titans and pro-China politicians meets on Wednesday to choose the territory's post-colonial chief executive.
Blessed by a personal public handshake from Chinese President Jiang Zemin last January, Tung ran off with 206 votes in the first round of voting last month by the committee, which was chosen under Beijing's close supervision.
Sovereignty over the territory of 6.3 million people, one of Asia's economic wonders and Britain's last major colony, reverts to China at midnight next June 30 -- 203 days from now.
A poll by Hong Kong's Lingnan College showed on Tuesday that 56 percent believed the winner has probably been picked in advance. Only 18 percent believe there will be a real contest.
""I don't think there was ever any doubt that it would be Mr Tung. I've been calling this selection committee the Tung Chee-hwa selection committee,"" said Martin Lee, head of the Democratic Party, the largest in Hong Kong's legislature.
Lee, whose party is boycotting the selection process, said Tung could not be counted on to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms, human rights and its current moves towards greater democracy.
""The people of Hong Kong cannot trust him to protect our rights, not because he is a bad man, he is a nice guy, but I cannot see how he is in a position to say no to Beijing on any important issue,"" Lee said.
Some Hong Kong newspapers were already putting the finishing touches on Tuesday to a slew of Tung-the-victor profiles for publication on Wednesday, an industry source said.
If he wins on Wednesday, Tung will be greeted soon by a no-confidence debate presented by lawmaker Emily Lau, one of China's loudest critics.
Colonial Governor Chris Patten has promised his support for the chief executive-designate, whoever it turns out to be, in the twilight months of British rule.
Tung has not responded to the pledge but has said he will engage Hong Kong's respected civil service in dialogue on how best to run the territory and ensure a smooth transition.
""Nobody wants the present administration to be turned into a lame duck,"" Tung said on Monday.
Two rival candidates -- former Chief Justice Ti Liang Yang and entrepreneur Peter Woo -- are both ranked as outsiders.
An opinion poll by Hong Kong University last week gave Tung 46.7 percent, Yang 28.8 percent and Woo 5.2 percent public backing.
But Tung only began to gain public support in the past month, after Patten's chief civil servant Anson Chan declared she would not run for the job. Tung has never matched the 60 percent-plus popularity ratings which Chan enjoyed.
Assuming he wins, the 59-year-old tycoon will spend the next six months assembling a cabinet of advisers to guide policy after Hong Kong becomes an autonomous Special Administrative Region of China. His team is expected to be highly pro-business, but he has also promised a role for grassoots bodies.
He will also lay the groundwork for a provisional legislature, soon to be picked by the same Selection Committee, to take over from the present elected Legco next July 1.
The leader-in-waiting will face many challenges before and after the handover, with Britain and China locked in disputes on issues ranging from passports, nationality and troop deployments to an anti-subversion law and the disbanding of Legco.

26,"An American businessman is plotting a marketing revolution in the hospitality sector and aims to house U.S. pioneers in the China market.
Corporate housing specialist Howard Ruby says he aims to turn the business of letting serviced apartments into a full-fledged industry that will provide everything from Internet terminals in the home to child care and jobs for expatriate spouses.
FROM POOR COUSIN OF HOTELS TO A GLOBAL SERVICE
Until recently the sector providing ready-to-live-in, service-provided, short-term apartments was a poor cousin of hotels, and in many cities of the world it still is.
""This whole industry has been below the radar screen over the last twenty years, being done by a mama and papa, or a small operator that operates one building at a time,"" said Ruby.
""And now we're seeing an industry evolve because of the needs of corporate clients as business globalises around the world,"" the head of Los Angeles-based Oakwood International said in an interview at a recent hotel industry conference.
EYES ON ASIA AND CHINA MARKETS
Ruby's group recently launched a joint venture with a subsidiary of Australia-listed Lend Lease in Singapore with plans to provide 10,000 serviced apartments in Asia, and intends to take aim at London during the next year.
Ruby foresees large-scale expansion in the sector in the Far East, especially in China, with much of American industry abuzz with plans to move people into the region.
Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have large expatriate populations as well as large numbers of home-grown professionals moving around the country on assignment who need temporary serviced housing.
""I just finished a tour of major client companies in the United States. Every single one is planning an expansion into the Far East, with most of them talking about China.
""Telecommunications, software companies, all the way through to clothing and furniture manufacturers. They're all talking China right now. Whereas a company might have sent 10 people last year, they're expecting to send over 20 people this coming year,"" he said.
The serviced apartment industry is starting to break away from the niche market identity and family-style business of old into a multifaceted service industry, Ruby believes.
CORPORATE RELOCATIONS PROVIDE HUGE MARKET POTENTIAL
Oakwood is the largest national provider of serviced apartments in the United States, with offices in 60 cities, more than 17,000 apartments and 25,000 clients including 400 of the Fortune 500 companies and 75 of the world's top multinationals.
The potential of the business is highlighted by one client that carries out 50,000 relocations of staff a year, with an average three months stay in temporary housing, Ruby said.
A company like General Motors, for example, might need help with relocation or temporary housing for staff moved around on training, special projects like setting up new production lines and might put out 25,000 apartment requirements a year.
Ruby started out catering to the niche market of new college graduates three decades ago -- apartments for baby boomers.
He moved on to corporate housing when companies asked for more services, such as maid service and taking care of bills.
SERVICED APARTMENTS TO BECOME MULTIFACETED SERVICE
He sees the business progressing to include video conferencing, Internet hookups, sports and recreation facilities, orientation tours, child care and job search agencies for spouses.
""This way a serviced apartment offers a branded service dedicated to the needs of the corporate customer. They are not just a physical facility, but a service provider,"" he said.
""Companies do not want staff transfers to end in failure because of a dissatisfied spouse. So we want to provide a service that makes a transfer a success.""
With an increasingly cluttered market, customers looked now to a reputable brand as their one point of contact, Ruby said.
DEALS IN THE PIPELINE IN ASIA
In the Far East, Oakwood and partners are working on deals in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila and Bangkok.
The first Asian project to go onstream will be Oakwood Premier, a serviced apartment scheme in Shanghai's historic Xuhui district, where the French concession was located in pre-revolutionary times. The property, owned by a Hong Kong family, will open later this year.
""As the industry matures in Asia, dedicated service companies will be the providers of choice for the corporations leasing the majority of serviced apartments,"" Ruby said.

26,"China and Britain moved closer on Friday to removing some obstacles to Hong Kong's smooth transfer to Chinese sovereignty next year, but fresh controversies raised new potential hurdles.
Agreements took shape on issues of handover ceremonies and budgets but quarrels brewed over China's moves to appoint new political leaders for Hong Kong.
Hong Kong government radio quoted diplomats saying London and Beijing were closing in on an agreement on a ceremony to mark Hong Kong's handover to China next June 30/July 1 and that the deal might be announced next month.
The sources signalled progress in informal talks and that a basic accord could be forged before foreign ministers of the two nations meet at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next month, the government-run radio said.
Differences over handover ceremonies have posed a stumbling block in negotiations on the sovereignty transfer, especially the question of what role Governor Chris Patten will play.
At the same time concrete progress was announced in talks on Hong Kong's next budget, which will straddle the handover date.
British and Chinese negotiators agreed on ways to allocate resources for the 1997/98 budget, Chinese senior official Chen Zuo'er told reporters after the latest talks.
Chen announced agreement on spending guidelines, maximum spending limits and procedures for dealing with new requests for money from the budget. Hong Kong Treasury Secretary K.C. Kwong was upbeat about the breakthrough.
""We have in the past few days had very positive pragmatic discussions on the preparation of the 1997-98 Budget,"" he said.
""We have for all practical purposes completed the preparatory stage of the resource allocation exercise,"" he said.
""Our next step will be to consider the bids for new resources from branches and departments.""
But prospects of a smooth handover on the political front appear less bright. A Beijing official was quoted as saying a list of names of people being nominated by the public to sit on a caucus that will pick the first post-colonial legislature and governor, the chief executive, would not be made public.
The official was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying some nominees might not want their names to be publicised and that only the nominees would have the right to see the list.
""This whole fiasco is too much. The whole thing is such a sham,"" pro-democracy legislator Emily Lau told Reuters.
""Perhaps they feel some important people will be embarrassed if they are not picked. The whole process lacks transparency and accountability and credibility.""
The Wen Wei Po newspaper, flagship of Beijing's propaganda machine in Hong Kong, attacked Britain on Friday for trying to amend Hong Kong's laws in order to preserve London's influence after 1997.
The salvo came just a day after the paper criticised Britain's chief handover negotiator, Hugh Davies, accusing him of touting Britain's own favourite for post-1997 leader.
Davies' office dismissed the claim as ludicrous but Chinese spokesman Zhang Junsheng told reporters: ""The British side should not meddle, and has no right to poke its nose in. This is entirely a matter for China.""

26,"A page of history is set to turn when Chinese troops enter Hong Kong on Monday to prepare for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) after Britain marches out of the territory in July.
The 40-strong advance party led by Major-General Zhou Borong will arrive in the colony on British Queen Elizabeth's birthday. They will drive into Hong Kong from China's Shenzhen region in full uniform but unarmed.
The PLA advance guard will be the first Chinese troops ever to be stationed on Hong Kong island.
Eight PLA staff cars and trucks will enter at the Lok Ma Chau land crossing at around lunchtime (0500 GMT).
They will drive the 30 km (19 miles) to the Prince of Wales Barracks in downtown Hong Kong, arriving soon after British troops fire a 21-gun salute marking the Queen's birthday.
The advance party will be the first of up to 10,000 PLA troops who will form the Hong Kong garrison after Britain returns its last Asian colony -- a bustling capitalist outpost of 6.4 million people -- to Communist-ruled China at midnight on June 30.
Up to 200 advance troops are expected to arrive before the handover. By that day, Britain will have phased out its garrison forces, which were once 10,000-strong in the territory.
The last of the famed ""Black Watch"" highlanders regiment will depart just after the midnight flag change.
""This is an historic event,"" Edward Ho, a legislator of the relatively pro-China Liberal Party, told reporters.
But the anti-Communist Democratic Party, which received the largest number of votes in the 1995 elections, disagreed.
""This entry has little significance or excitement. The soldiers will keep a very low profile,"" said the party's security spokesman James To.
It will be the first quasi-sovereign presence China has been allowed in the transition towards handover.
Beijing is currently represented in Hong Kong by its Xinhua News Agency, by a diplomatic establishment known as the Joint Liaison Group, and by a large array of mainland companies.
British authorities said the PLA group will get no special treatment at the frontier. They will go through normal customs and immigration controls and then find their own way from the border to the Prince of Wales Barracks, where 28 of them will be billeted. Twelve will stay on nearby Stonecutters Island, where Britain recently closed its Tamar Naval base.
""The soldiers will be unarmed and are here to carry out practical preparations for the PLA to take over responsibility for the defence of Hong Kong on July 1,"" British armed forces spokesman Roger Goodwin told Reuters.
General Zhou will be greeted at the barracks by British garrison commander, Major-General Bryan Dutton.
""They will be greeted with normal courtesies, handshakes and salutes,"" Goodwin said.
""It is in the best long-term interests of the people of Hong Kong that there should be a smooth transfer of defence responsibilities to the PLA,"" he said.
""The British garrison looks forward to working with the advance party to help ensure a successful transfer. The future PLA garrison inherits a proud tradition from the British Hong Kong garrison, a success story which we will do everything to help them continue.""
Many of Hong Kong's people are disturbed by the imminent arrival of an army whose tanks crushed the student-led democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
China has gone to pains in recent months to soothe those anxieties with a PLA campaign at their interim base over the border in Shenzhen, parading elite troops and stressing their qualities of virtue, discipline and high education.

49,"China appealed for calm while South Korea called for a military alert amid fears a diplomatic deadlock over a senior Pyongyang defector marooned in Beijing could push the hermit North to take extreme action.
However, signs emerged that North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-il might be ready to give up the fight to recover scholarly ideologue Hwang Jang-yop -- possibly as a result of mediation by Beijing to end the Cold War crisis in its backyard.
South Korean officials said talks continued with Beijing over the fate of Hwang, ranked 24th in Pyongyang's hierarchy, who spent his seventh day behind the white walls of Seoul's consulate office in Beijing.
Hwang could be the first in a stream of high-level defectors to betray their Stalinist homeland, beset by two years of floods, food shortages and talk of power struggles, South Korean media reported in Seoul.
South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung called for ""extraordinary alertness"" and military readiness against North Korea, saying Hwang's defection had sent shock waves through the divided Korean peninsula.
A Seoul newspaper said it had documents revealing plans by other North Korean officials to flee.
""The defection of secretary Hwang Jang-yop, who belongs to the core force of the North Korean leadership, vividly displays the shaking of the ideological foundation that has supported the North Korean system amid economic disasters,"" Lee said.
Seoul would spare no diplomatic efforts to allow Hwang to be granted political asylum, he said.
Lee told parliament that Pyongyang had increasingly deployed offensive forces near the border with the South, despite an economic crisis and chronic food shortages.
A military spokesman said Lee was referring to the North's defence build-up in recent years and no additional troops had been deployed at the tense border in the past week.
But China took no chances and sent three armoured personnel carriers to reinforce approaches to Seoul's mission, apparently not reassured by signs Pyongyang could be coming to terms with the loss of one of its greatest ideological thinkers.
The softer tone set when Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said it would dismiss Hwang if he defected was echoed by supreme leader Kim, who said those who lacked the grit to defend Pyongyang's fiery brand of communism should go their own way.
""As the revolutionary song goes: Cowards, Leave If You Want To! We will defend the red flag to the bitter end,"" a political essay broadcast by state radio quoted Kim as saying.
Pyongyang officials had previously been steadfast in their accusation that Seoul abducted the architect of North Korea's governing ideology of Juche, or strict self-reliance. South Korea has dismissed the charge as preposterous.
North Korea's ambassador met Chinese Foreign Ministry officials in talks that apparently resulted in Pyongyang's change in tune and withdrawal of diplomats from a vigil outside the mission where Hwang is marooned, Western diplomats said.
Beijing, an unwilling third party in the feuding between the two hostile sides in the last Cold War standoff, repeated its plea to both to act with restraint to resolve the affair.
The United States has urged Pyongyang to avoid all provocative actions and has said it was closely monitoring developments after an assassination attempt against a former North Korean defector near Seoul on Saturday night.
The tussle over Hwang's defection was the latest flare-up in tense relations between the two Koreas, arch-enemies since the 1950-53 Korean civil war ended only in a truce.
"
49,"China's private sector has become an important source of jobs for workers laid off by loss-making state enterprises and officials said on Thursday the jobless were able to find work despite fears of rising unemployment.
In 1995, the private sector hired 1.5 million workers made redundant from state- and collectively owned enterprises, an official of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce said in a telephone interview.
The official also noted a shift in the type of staff being employed by private enterprise as China's fastest growing sector expands and modernises.
""Before, employees were mainly peasants and young jobless,"" the administration official said.
""But in the last two years, the number of those employed after leaving state enterprises has increased,"" he said. ""And there will be a bigger increase in employment of this type of worker in the next couple of years.""
The main reason that workers were attracted to the sink-or-swim world of private enterprise from the jobs-for-life system in state firms was high wages, he said.
China's private companies and self-employed accounted for a total of 56 million jobs, or six percent of China's employed workers, at the end of 1995, he said.
China had 654,500 private companies and 25.28 million self-employed workers at the end of 1995 compared with none in 1979, when paramount leader Deng Xiaoping launched his market-oriented economic reforms.
Many had found jobs in Shenyang, at the heart of China's rust-belt and a city groaning with money-losing state firms, the official said. The city had found jobs for 800,000 laid-off workers in the last two years.
In Shanghai, more than 85,000 redundant state workers had created their own businesses or found jobs in private firms.
The administration official said private enterprise had averaged growth of 50 percent to 60 percent a year over the past three years, although that was expected to slow to about 30 percent over the next few years.
An official of the Ministry of Personnel said state enterprises had shed more than 2.0 million workers in recent years, many of them helped to find work by their former employers or through fledgling labour markets.
China's urban unemployment rate was 2.9 percent at the end of June, up by 0.01 percent from the same time last year, official figures show.
However, official media have warned that the actual rate could soar to 7.4 percent by 2000.
Nine out of 10 people entering the job market have found jobs through the new labour markets since 1995, the Xinhua news agency quoted an official of the Ministry of Personnel as saying.
The few who still enjoy the state's ""iron rice bowl"" in terms of assigning jobs include demobilised soldiers and college graduates.
At the start of 1995, China had more than 29,000 employment service organisations, which offered jobs to more than 12 million people last year, the official said.

49,"China is dipping its toe into the freedoms of Hong Kong but is finding the water chilly -- and Beijing's latest pronouncement on freedom of expression under Chinese rule may be giving it cold feet, analysts said on Friday.
China's communist rulers are so accustomed to exercising power that is scarcely checked by law, they may be having difficulty curbing their tongues when it comes to the delicate handover of Hong Kong, diplomats said on Friday.
One example came on Thursday when China tried to backtrack from a warning by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Hong Kong people on limits to their freedom of expression after the territory reverts to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997.
""Chinese officials seem to be speaking from the heart when it comes to Hong Kong and then realise that they have put their foot in their mouth where the law is concerned,"" said one Western analyst.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang raced on Thursday to repair damage from his boss's remarks, saying: ""Hong Kong people will have full freedom of expression, but all freedoms must be within the limits allowed by law.""
His statement followed an interview with Foreign Minister Qian by the Asian Wall Street Journal,in which Qian hinted that Hong Kong would no longer be able to mark the anniversary of Beijing's June 4, 1989, crackdown on student-led protests.
Qian's interview stirred an outcry in Hong Kong, where China has pledged a high degree of political freedoms for 50 years after the handover on July 1, 1997, and not to change its capitalist system.
But Shen's damage control may have been too late.
Western diplomats said Qian's remarks gave great cause for concern and were almost certain to stir anxiety in Hong Kong.
""Ordinary Hong Kong people have fairly mixed feelings,"" said one Western diplomat. ""There is an element of patriotism about their return to the mainland but they don't want their basic freedoms to be put in question.""
Chinese officials said Foreign Minister Qian was believed to have shown great interest in the response in Hong Kong to his remarks on the limits on what Hong Kong's people could do after the 1997 handover.
Qian was reported to have showed little surprise at the reaction in Hong Kong, and had paid close attention to the stir in the territory, one official said.
""It looks as if he may have gone a little beyond what he should have said,"" said another Western diplomat. ""But he clearly thought he was safe in saying that and now they are trying to smooth over the rough edges.""
Hong Kong newspaper reports that interpreted Qian's remarks as a ban on activities in the territory to commemorate the 1989 crackdown were wrong, Shen said, adding that Beijing had not altered its pledge to maintain Hong Kong's current political and economic system under Chinese sovereignty.
A transcript of Qian's interview showed he was specifically asked what activities would not be allowed and whether the 1989 commemoration was among them. Qian replied that he was referring to just such activities.
""This isn't the first time this kind of faux pas has happened,"" one diplomat said, referring to similar remarks this year on post-1997 freedom limitations by Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under China's State Council, or cabinet.
""I don't expect that it will be the last.""
"
49,"China has launched a manhunt across the restive region of Tibet, tightened airport security and offered a reward of $120,000 for the arrest of culprits who exploded a bomb in Lhasa last week, officials said on Monday.
The government had announced a reward of one million yuan ($120,000) for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the bomb blast early on Christmas Day outside city government offices in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, a senior official said.
""No one has yet been arrested and we are now mobilising and deploying our forces,"" Lhasa Vice Mayor Ou Yangxiang said in a telephone interview.
Notice of the reward had been published in the Lhasa Evening News on December 27 and it was being issued in other newspapers in the strategic Himalayan region, government officials said.
The Christmas Day bomb, the largest so far set off by anti-Chinese activists in restive Tibet, had resulted in no casualties but caused widespread damage, shattering windows within a radius of 100 metres (yards), officials said.
""Almost the whole of Lhasa heard it,"" said one Lhasa government official. ""It was a muffled sound, like -- whoong.""
Officials insisted there was little doubt that the blast was politically motivated and carried out by followers of the region's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.
The bomb exploded at night outside a government building and was therefore clearly political, said Zhou Kaifu, deputy director of the Tibet Public Security Bureau.
""This was done by the Dalai separatist camp,"" the government official said, adding that the attack bore the hallmarks of previous similar ""terrorist acts"". He declined to give details although several smaller bombings have been reported in Lhasa.
""This is a terrorist act, aimed at destroying peace in our area,"" he said. ""This was a brazen act.""
Police had set up a special task force to search for the culprits and customs and immigration officials had stepped up security searches at Tibet's airport, he said.
The senior police official said the bomb was a home-made device made mainly from ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser.
""We are targeting Tibetan exiles returning from abroad and who have political connections,"" he said when asked about the focus of the manhunt.
""The bomb was made at a farm,"" he said. ""We are searching mainly in Lhasa, but are cooperating with other areas.""
China regularly blames followers of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, for anti-Chinese unrest that erupts sporadically in the strategic Himalayan region that borders India.
The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for his homeland, says he wants self-government and freedom of worship in the deeply religious Buddhist region. He fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Beijing rule.
Monks in the devout Buddhist region who have spearheaded anti-Chinese demonstrations and riots in the past were not regarded as suspects, the police official said.
Officials have vowed to retaliate, signalling a possible renewed crackdown on anti-Chinese unrest in the region.
""We should wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the Dalai clique's sabotage,"" local radio quoted Gyamco, vice chairman of the regional government as saying last week.
Several much smaller bombs have been been set off in Lhasa in the last two years, including one in 1995 that caused slight damage to a plaque donated by Beijing and another last March outside the headquarters of the Tibet regional government.

49,"When China wanted to hide the death of an emperor on the road 2,000 years ago it filled his carriage with fish to disguise the smell.
Now it uses enigmatic language to throw a smokescreen around the state of its leaders' health.
Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who remains China's most powerful leader even though he formally retired from his last official post in 1990, is 92 and frail, and has not been seen in public for more than three years.
China's Communist Party leaders have shrouded Deng and his health in a veil of secrecy, issuing only terse statements saying he is as well as can be expected for a man of his advanced years, or that there has been ""no big change"".
""This is Chinese culture,"" said one Western diplomat. ""The emperor can't be seen to be dying until he actually dies.""
The power struggle on the death of a Chinese emperor -- or communist strongman -- has traditionally been bloody, and analysts say the departure of Deng is unlikely to be an exception.
When China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, died while travelling in the south in 210 BC, his prime minister filled the emperor's carriage with fish for two weeks to hide the smell of the rotting corpse, fearing a power struggle before he could reach the capital.
China's communist leaders will probably not conceal the death of Deng for as long as two weeks -- the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 was announced within 12 hours of his passing.
But they are doing their utmost to prevent hard information on any deterioration in Deng's health from reaching the 1.2 billion Chinese whose fate could hang in the balance.
The instinct for self-preservation and a Chinese abhorrence of any talk of death may be two motivations behind the secrecy of Deng's anointed successor, Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin, and his colleagues.
""There is always a nexus between the health of the nation and its leader,"" said a Western sinologist who declined to be identified. ""In a culture so concerned with life and longevity... death is the ultimate horror.""
One Chinese analyst agreed.
""In China's current system, the fate of the nation depends on the fate of the leader,"" he said.
""They are not only afraid that news that Deng is close to death could spark a really fierce power struggle, but they also worry about public instability,"" he said.
Deng is not the only powerful communist veteran of Mao's generation who still lives, and any elder who outlives Deng could step into his shoes as kingmaker and force a power struggle around Jiang.
Most diplomats say Jiang has already consolidated his position as Deng's successor in the party, government and military and say major blood-letting is unlikely after Deng's death. Jiang has even disbanded Deng's personal office.
""I don't think it's going to come as a shock to anybody when he finally does pass away,"" another Western diplomat said.
""It's not going to really mean a big shake-up in the leadership here or tanks rolling down the street,"" she said.
Still Beijing prefers to keep Deng's situation a secret. China's communist rulers inherit a system of based on veneration for age.
""It is highly disrespectful to the leader to discuss his health in public,"" said the Western sinologist.

49,"China's Deng Xiaoping launched the greatest economic boom on earth and justified his reforms to doubting Marxist ideologues with one deceptively simple phrase.
The maxim that Deng used as an ideological figleaf to cover his near-heretical treatment of Marxist economics was ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
The phrase that would justify private enterprise, ownership of property and lifting of price controls in a state run by the Communist Party saw the light of day in Deng's opening speech to the 12th party congress on September 1, 1982.
""We must integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of China, blaze a path of our own and build a socialism with Chinese characteristics -- that is the basic conclusion we have reached after summing up long historical experience,"" Deng told the elders of the central committee.
The congress was crucial for Deng's nascent economic reforms, already running into resistance from his orthodox Marxist colleagues who feared -- rightly as it turned out -- that his employment of market forces would erode three decades of Stalinist command economics.
""Deng's greatest contribution of all was that simple phrase 'Chinese characteristics',"" said one Western diplomat.
""It ensured that you could do anything you thought was appropriate. It should be engraved on his tomb.""
That single phrase enabled Deng to dump the revolutionary fervour nurtured by the late chairman Mao Zedong in favour of doing pretty much what he wanted.
""This was a huge leap forward compared with the Mao era,"" said a Chinese political scientist. ""This sentence guided China on to the path of modernisation. It marked the shift from Mao's path to Deng's path and enabled Deng to do an enormous number of things.""
It ended the sole system of public ownership. Collective and private enterprises were born. It also ended cradle-to-grave care and control by the party.
Chinese could be sacked, they could resign. They were free to find their own jobs. They could move house. They had to pay for their own education and medical care.
The command economy gave way to market forces.
What Deng created was no longer socialism, neither was it capitalism.
It was somewhere in between. It was socialism with Chinese characteristics.

49,"Top Hollywood film stars, including screen idols Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, have been placed on a blacklist of 50 people barred from visiting the restive region of Tibet, Chinese officials said on Friday.
News that some of Hollywood's biggest box office draws were on a blacklist comes just weeks after Beijing clashed with U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney Co over its film on the life of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.
Brad Pitt, Harrison Ford and his wife Melissa Mathison Ford as well as directors Martin Scorsese and Jean-Jaques Annaud were among a group of movie personalities on a blacklist held by the Tibet Tourism Bureau, a tourist official said by telephone from the regional capital, Lhasa.
""Last October, we were verbally informed by the Tibet state security office that those foreigners should not be given an entry permit if they applied to visit Tibet,"" he said.
""At the end of April or in early May, we received the formal documents,"" he said, when asked if the Hollywood stars were barred from the Himalayan region that has been rocked by sporadic anti-Chinese unrest in recent years.
""They are banned from coming here for any reason,"" the official said, adding that none of those named on the list had yet applied to visit.
Brad Pitt stars as an escaped Austrian prisoner of war, who fled India in World War Two and found refuge in Lhasa where he befriended the young Dalai Lama, in the film ""Seven Years in Tibet"" that is directed by Annaud. China has not formally objected to the film.
However, it has apparently tried to halt production by California-based Walt Disney of the film ""Kundun"" that tells of the Dalai Lama's early life and is directed by Scorsese. Mathison Ford is a scriptwriter for the movie.
Disney has said it will go ahead with the release of ""Kundun"" despite China's objections. Beijing has denied putting pressure on Disney to withdraw backing for the film.
Beijing has been reported to have warned Walt Disney last month that its ambitious business plans in China were at risk if it went ahead with the release of the movie.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Disney would be wrong to sing the praises of the exiled spiritual leader.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule and has since waged a non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland.
However, the blacklist did not include actor Richard Gere, who has long backed the Tibetan spiritual movement and is an active supporter of the Dalai Lama, the tourism official said.
Gere was among a group of movie luminaries who this month wrote to China's ambassador in Washington protesting against what they called Beijing's ""attempt to impose worldwide censorship"".
Officials had begun to compile a blacklist of foreigners barred from visiting the restive area in 1993, and the list had now reached more than 50 names, he said.
All foreign visitors to Tibet are required first to obtain an entry permit issued by local authorities who are anxious to keep out Westerners who may support the underground pro-independence movement spearheaded by the region's monks.

49,"China tightened its grip on the media on Sunday with directives on how to write news, ordering journalists not to advocate sex, violence and superstition and to fill their reports with patriotism and socialism.
The latest guidelines from China's propaganda mandarins come amid an ongoing crackdown on ideas that step out of line with party precepts, and which has been billed as a campaign to promote spiritual civilisation, or civic responsibility.
Quoting Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin's Stalinist description of reporters as ""engineers of the human soul"", the All China Journalists' Association issued a communique to reporters to submit to the ""supervision of the party and the people"".
The association set up a hotline for the public to report journalists who break the new rules, in a move reminiscent of the witchhunts of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and other political campaigns espoused by Chairman Mao Zedong.
To ensure China's reporters were familiar with what they should and should not do, the China News Workers' Association issued a detailed six-part directive via the official Xinhua news agency.
Top of the list was ""wholeheartedly to serve the people"".
To achieve this goal, the directive urged reporters to fulfil their supervisory role by ""bravely criticising and exposing erroneous words and actions and corrupt phenomena that harm the people's interests"".
Party chief and state president Jiang has personally mounted a drive to stamp out corruption, a plague he has warned could topple the party, and has used propaganda to back his cause.
However, the new directive also specifies events from which reporters should steer clear and the tone in which they should cover topics that are acceptable.
Urging reporters to uphold a ""correct"" tone in public opinion, it tells them to promote patriotism, collectivism and socialism.
""News reports must not advocate sex, murder, violence, ignorance and superstition and other bad taste content that harm the spiritual health of the people,"" it said.
This was essential for political stability as well as the happiness of the masses, it said.
The directive also called on reporters to respect the constitution and the law, telling them not to publish reports that determine the nature of a case or a crime before the courts have delivered their verdict.
China has long used the state-controlled press to publicise crimes or criminals it wants to hold up as examples with little regard to whether sentence has been passed.
Neither will reporters be allowed to use the media to spread propaganda that differs from party decisions, the directive said, in a rare signal that some more independent-minded newspapers may be straying from the party line.
Reporters must also strictly protect the secrets of the party and the state, uphold the truth in news and not use the media for their own personal ends, it said. It gave no hint as to how reporters should reconcile the possibly differing demands of the truth and the party.
Last week, China's propaganda tsars ordered journalists to stop violating socialist ethics by asking for money, gifts, credit cards or houses in return for positive reporting, and banned warned them against insider trading.
Reporters ""must voluntarily oppose worship of money, hedonism and individualism"", the directive said.
China's communist rulers keep a tight grip on the media, which they view as a propaganda tool that must serve party interests. Propaganda officials have called on journalists to back party policies and give priority to ""positive"" reporting.

49,"One of China's most prominent dissidents, Wang Dan, is expected to receive a harsh sentence on the charge of plotting to overthrow the government, his mother said on Tuesday.
Wang, 27, would plead not guilty to the capital charge when his trial at the Beijing Intermediate People's Court begins on Wednesday, said the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun.
""The court...giving my son a harsh sentence even though he is innocent is very likely to happen,"" Wang Lingyun told Reuters. ""I dare not rule it out.""
She said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days. Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.
The former student leader, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.
The court has refused to give details of Wang's trial except to say he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.
His family found a lawyer willing to defend the dissident after being given just one day in which to do so.
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.
The mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated during his detention.
Human Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.
""The fact is that China's urban dissident movement... has in effect been comprehensively smashed,"" it said in a statement.
""At least where political dissidents are concerned, all the judicial signs thus far point... to intensified repression by the country's state security forces,"" it said, calling for a freeze on trade missions from the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.
The human rights group said Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers were generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence.
Wang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
Officials have been silent on a request by the U.S. embassy in Beijing to send observers to Wang's trial, diplomats said.
French senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh, and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand have also said they want to observe Wang's trial.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday shrugged off questions from reporters about the status of the requests, saying Wang's trial was China's internal affair.
Beijing has repeatedly come under fire from the West for human rights abuses. It says foreign intervention in China's internal affairs is not welcome.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
He was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.

49,"China has jailed a Tibetan music expert touring the Himalayan region on a U.S. scholarship for 18 years for spying in one of the harshest sentences ever meted out in the restive region, local radio reported on Friday.
Ngawang Choephel, 30, who was travelling in Tibet as a Fulbright scholar to produce an amateur documentary about traditional music and dance, was detained by the authorities in Tibet in August, 1995, said the broadcast monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
The young scholar confessed to having been sent to Tibet by ""the Dalai (Lama) clique"" on behalf of an unnamed foreign country to conduct espionage activities, the report said in a thinly veiled reference to the United States.
U.S. officials had no immediate comment on the case.
He was visiting ""under the pretext of collecting information on Tibetan folk songs and dances"", the radio broadcast said.
""In accordance with the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China... The Intermediate People's Court of Xigaze Prefecture sentenced Ngawang Choephel to an 18-year prison term for committing espionage crime,"" the radio said.
He was deprived of his political rights for four years.
China has been swift to crack down on any sign of anti-Chinese unrest in the Himalayan region.
Beijing has been especially nervous about anyone with possible links to the exiled Dalai Lama, Tibet's god-king, since he announced in 1995 his own candidate as the reincarnation of the region's second holiest monk, the Panchen Lama. China later presided over the discovery of an alternative reincarnation.
""The striking thing is the length of the sentence,"" Robbie Barnett of the London-based group Tibet Information Network said in a telephone interview. ""It is quite extraordinary.""
Ngawang Choephol's sentence was the most severe handed down in a political case since Tibetan monk Ngawang Phulchung was jailed for 19 years in 1989 for subversion after publishing political leaflets, including a manifesto for a democratic Tibet.
Another monk, Jampel Changchup, was also sentenced in 1989 to 19 years in prison for subversion and espionage.
""It does seem to be a provocative decision in political terms because it names three times 'a certain foreign government',"" Barnett said.
""It appears to mean the end of any sense that China is susceptible to the international community on human rights issues,"" he said. ""They now feel confident to use counter-espionage laws against political offenders.""
Ngawang Choephol left Tibet as a child shortly after the Chinese takeover in 1950 and grew up in India before going to Middlebury College in Vermont in 1993 as a Fulbright scholar in ethnomusicology.
The young man, who once worked as a dance teacher in India, travelled to Tibet in 1995 to make his amateur documentary.
To gain permission to travel to his birthplace, Ngawang Choephol renounced his Indian refugee status and entered Tibet as a Chinese citizen, Barnett said.
He was last reported to have been seen in Nyari prison in Xigaze, Tibet's second largest city in the west of the Himalayan region, in September 1995, shortly after his arrest in the local market.
""It is very unlikely that he was a spy,"" said Barnett. ""He was genuinely making the film he said he was making. No one wold have entrusted him to do this because he was not competent to carry out any hidden activities.
""He is a rather distracted, emotional artist,"" he said.
